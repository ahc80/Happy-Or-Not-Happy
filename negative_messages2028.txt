i know someone admitted for â€˜28 should i invite them
Lol idk
We don't need more mods atm
except orange
One billion points to gryffindor for changing mod color tho
ironically i really suck at like normal activity dancing
though i guess new server excitement is a thing
I wasnâ€™t in the co2027 server until the semester started so I have no reference for activity levels
I've actually never heard it before
This totally feels like
tbf you said the 27 one would die by orientation and certainly it saw more use in the summer but dead would be a strong word
I was wrong as per usual
Iâ€™ve never been able to come up with decent usernames for stuff
Can't get me anymore
Oh nein I
Youâ€™re not alone bestie
you wouldnt know it by my grammar though (as my uncle never hesitates to point out)
Guess I'm the exact opposite!
oh rip
over my dead body. bayern is worse
Sadly I've never been so I'll tale your word for it
Oh danke. Ich muss Deutchland gehen, wann ich kanne.
i changed my whole phone to phone to german
My phone changes itself to German
I've always wanted to make a conlang
Learning a conlang is crazy nerd shit
could never make one. am interested in learning
I used to try to start making them but through a mixture of no motivation and not knowing how languages work I never actually got one going
Busy but I feel so alive
i on the other hand am oh so sleepy (was also busy)
Isn't it like right after winter break?
How do you have anything summative yet???
My high school is weird so the first semester isn't done yet. Technically we were still in the last week of the second quarter.
ive seen a handful of schools extend the semester like that--mine had the first semester continue 2 weeks after break but exams were before break? people in charge of schedules just make stuff up i think
the general consensus is whoever came up with that was drunk and didn't think it through at all (we had basically 2 weeks of exams bc of snow)
I'm sure it's possible, but I don't think it's recommended
i canâ€™t speak to engineering but i know a handful of physics + astronomy + dance people and itâ€™s a lot but doable it seems
cuz i heard its only like a few classes difference
Become class of 2030
my ra says most of the dance stuff doesnt generate homework which helps a lot
someone wanna play among us? we need a 10th
i havent been following nfc at all but i have a friend whos a die hard niners fan so i have utter faith the niners will win
I donâ€™t know anything about either team
I have faith in Jared Goff though 🙏
I have my money on the Chiefs winning it all
I am hoping and praying it's not them
I know I have a friend from Baltimore who went dead silent after Flowers's fumble
Not anymore
the unlikely schism of the nerd school discord server: football
^the cry of someone who does not sports
I'm from northern virginia so I quit on the Commanders long ago
I like the packers because of a misunderstanding when my father was a kid he went to a Rams Packers game (he is from LA) and cheered for the wrong team and just decided to commit to the bit so I grew up liking the packers
Have yâ€™all seen that theyâ€™re trying to clean the River Seine for the Olympics 💀
You couldnâ€™t pay me enough money to swim in that water
it was. Really weird.
I feel like all rivers near cities are absolutely disgusting
Are indie, folk, and kpop separate genres or is indie folk kpop some new genre I've never heard of
i dont use punctuation when texting unless its important 😅
My music taste is just Incorrect tho so donâ€™t trust my judgement
oh kpop
i don't particularly like it but i used to work at a boba place and that was all we played
Did they kill you???
ill never forget the lady that got fresh boba and then complained that it was too hot and that we must be doing something wrong because thats not "how the asians make it"
kill
we remake the drink like three times because it keeps tasting like something other than water
she then says "dont cool it down."
we're like "okay its gonna be a little warm still if we dont run it through ice"
really was my "ma'am i just work here" moment
they wanted the drink without the seal
You didnâ€™t let the aromas escape!
Death!
so like this whole thing happened between the manager and the customers right
THEY TAKE A PICTURE OF THE DRINKS WITHOUT A SEAL
ADN JUST LEAVE
i didn't but i think the barista who had to deal with them for twenty minutes got to keep it
we found the final drink still half full in the trash 20 minutes later
oh no
But after we hand it off it's like not our responsibility anymore technically
but we don't even charge for water so
Fair
Uh oh
Pain
(nah but if this is a serious question, there isn't one)
A right hand rule (or left hand rule) of sorts
i have like. no natural concept of left and right
if u hold both hands up and make an L gesture the one that actually makes an L is left
oops sorry
was trying to get file from computer to ipad
and wrong place 😭
The fuck
but you wont be complaining
More on the weather: what the hell Cleveland
Mysterious ass weather
Nefarious weather
Last year it hit 60 degrees in January
yeah prtty much. iirc last year we got snow one day then full sun like 70-something the next
and idk if this is everywhere but storms roll in so fast here
Cleveland has felt like thereâ€™s plenty of advance warning
in the summer its so hot and humid it all feels the same
ive at least never learned how to tell
Colorado storms come in from the Rockies so itâ€™s just super unexpected. Worse if youâ€™re in the mountains it can just be 60 and start hailing for 20 minutes and then be sunny again
damn
in colorado springs the weather just
been raining two weeks straight
hail without warning
gone now
Sorry about bots y'all
*head shakes\* terrible. you are responsible for controlling and preventing every single bot in the world from joining the server
Yeah idk either
i havent been to sacramento much (we call it sac 😭 )
i can never get myself to call it that tho
You know I met someone who tried to claim he was from California and then referred to SF as "San Fran"
berekeley is mainly collegetown tho lwk
they still mark up prices tho which sucks
i havent enrolled yet but it is one of my top choices
cleveland clinics close
Idk, I took a while to commit to case because it was very far from my hometown and that made me nervous
i just wanna get outta this suburb asap 😭  its so boring
What would be your guess?
idk tbh i was thinking west coast ish but not sure
Now Sophie, What State Am I From? Youâ€™ll Never Guess This One!
I think people just aren't used to meeting people from Nevada
Whereas you trip and find another mf from Cali
as someone who grew up in downtown baltimore i have not felt any lack of urban-ness here. worth noting i was gunning for a more suburban college so i wasnâ€™t specifically looking for places that were city enough for me but even so
i hate the suburbs
its so boring here hello 😭
Even if cleveland is urban isnâ€™t it stillâ€¦kinda boring?
Not really
Not really imo
oh u lucky 😭
but sf also smells bad
I hate nyc 😫
Like, I could probably go to an event for a club every day and find new clubs the whole semester
oh sick
Idk I've never had trouble finding a DnD group on campus
20 bucks, take it or leave it
oh?
fucking. fix the housing crisis
inflation cant even be an excuse
wtf
something something federal funding to get more money to the school and incentivize people via scholarships? i donâ€™t rlly remember but someone laid out a pretty compelling case to me a few months ago
idk man sometimes i think i should have just gone to college in germany for like 200â‚¬ a semester and then i remember that you canâ€™t take breadth classes and nobody wants to make friends and like maybe that would suck balls actually
thereâ€™s a lot thatâ€™s wrong with the us college system but there are upsides
but we dont have a lot of teachers in the us
still a lot
yeah you have to get a recommendation in 4th grade to go to gymnasium and if you donâ€™t youâ€™re shot basically
nah itâ€™s just called that idk
Gymnasium is the secondary school that feeds you into university
oh
elementary school k-4, gymnasium 5-12/realschule 5-10ish/haubtschule 5-10ish and some qualify you to go onto uni, some to higher level secondary school, some onto trade school/apprenticeships
must suck
@cygnusxxii you also can't go to german university directly from us high school
bc you havent done your abitur
well that shows you i never considered it very seriously at all
i tried looking for undergrad but ran into that problem
Christ. The new admits are already here. It feels like just a few months ago that I was accepted.
Rd decision won't be for another month or so
Hard to say. By credit hours I'm a sophomore and in SIS I show up as one, but I graduated last spring and was a fall admit for 2023 so by that metric I'm a Freshman.
Credit hour standing is weird tbh
Like I technically have junior credit hours, but I'm not going to graduate early or anything
@kgir06 did someone say math.
What kinds of math do you like
I didn't realize intros had such a slow mode
I also realized I never made one
honestly any math is fun
😳math?!
Math!
im kinda boring, but catullus is amazing
Catullus really just said shit tbh (I cannot read Latin but I have seen some fascinating translations)
Iâ€™m so jealous you have a Latin class 😭
my teacher sucks and im basically self studying lmao
its a lot of translating, which isnt bad, but not super fun
Yeah I have not had time to start actually learning to read the originals but some of the translations make me wish Iâ€™d started earlier
I took graph theory last semester here
i took a basic discrete math course over the summer and absolutely fell in love w it
Math is glory
And the 300+ math classes here make you think in a whole new way
Iâ€™m a math and English major and  307 my beloved 😍
What do yâ€™all do with a math major? Is it grad school next?
sorta wanna do something in engineering, so maybe that? irdk tho
I want to go to grad school but probably for CS
If youâ€™re accepted but havenâ€™t committed yet DO NOT COME HERE GUYS @28
see people think itâ€™s so funny be like haha i hate case donâ€™t go here but like that shit really freaked me out over the summer and maybe itâ€™s not so funny actually
I mean the stuff ppl say r bad arenâ€™t wrong, but they just blow it out of proportion
like any school will have weak points and iâ€™m sure there are people who do hate it here bc there will be at every school but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s all unavoidably bad
Bro didn't use the elevator
Oh the memories
Please pretend I never said that
so if you're in a greek org and have to move people in but aren't otherwise involved in oweek stuff do you get here a week early and just hang around
damn
I'm interested in environmental science research and math modeling 👍
Greek orgs don't *have* to help with move in, but if you do you move in early, help with move in, and then chill for a week without paying extra for housing
You know what I just realized
Though only about 4% of that is accessible year over year
Not doubting the figure but out of curiosity where does that 4% come from? They should be earning more than 4% on the money right? Like even if they held it as cash they would be earning about 5% right (if it was in a CD or high yield account) now and I know a lot of it is invested so should in theory be earning more. 

So even if they want to leave the principle untouched they should be able to spend more than 4% of it per year just from the income.
i came back from donating blood :>
Iâ€™ve DMâ€™dso many memes to the MATLAB.CWRU instagram account that theyâ€™ve started liking them
Yeah lol I just realized
I wasn't even like
hi everyone! just got accepted :) def considering this school, since i got a LOT of money for it (that i didnâ€™t even apply for LOL). and also because iâ€™ve heard really good things about the premed/predental track!
Probably the only situation where being poor is a good thing
Given how competitive cs typically is at any given school
Case doesnâ€™t really admit by major you can just change your major whenever you feel like
im sorry but id like to ask how exactly you got this much aid🤯
damn thats crazy. do they ever update the financial aid given to you over time?(lets say at by April)
I'm kinda hoping they do because I feel like the FAFSA more accurately reflects my need than the css profile does
And that doesn't get released till next week
Idk how they are for international students though. I could ask my roomie maybe
I doubled down that I probably wasn't getting in and they said I might
I literally just sped through the portal to see it cause I wasn't expecting anything and then I read congratulations and was like wtf
(Scary alert)
Yeah I forgot I had applied cause I was like â€œthereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m getting inâ€ and then after a week straight of getting denied from other places I checked my portal and it was like Oh.
Being poor 😎
Basically just asking if the FAFSA reflects that I need more aid than the css profile did will they defer to that or not
I am in need of money 💀
tired of these loans
someone was telling me i should reject the unsubsidized and subsidized loans
Do you have the money to pay without loans?
Without the loans it goes up to 8k a year which is still very cheap just compared to 3k lol
Can you pay directly without loans? If so, don't take the loans. If you cannot, take the loans
i couldnt find them online but i also didnt look very hard tbf
Tbh I barely know any people who are only doing a single major without a minor
i know a handful of humanities majors on the premed track, which i personally think is sick and iâ€™m told med schools also like bc it makes you stand out from the horde of bio/biochem premeds
Do you go outside
I don't trust myself enough to be able to handle the course load of cs and something else ngl
Thatâ€™s fair. Do what feels good to you
If I want to get an internship or job in that area
Like generally the 3 paths I was thinking about were game development swe or ai but game devving is a horrible field to be in
Swe just seems like impossible now 💀 and ai idek what to think about that
As someone whoâ€™s doing CS research, if you want advice or pointers (not the programming kind) I can give
Yeah you really want like 1985 😭
In the context of cs I'm like a decade late
Also, my advice would be to *try* five classes first semester. Because if it isnâ€™t working out thereâ€™s freshman forgiveness and you can drop a class. No harm no foul.
Imo you should aim for 15-16 credits each semester. Unless you need to do more to graduate, don't suffer for no reason 😭
But I didnâ€™t try it out until too late to take advantage of freshman forgiveness so I would advise you to try if youâ€™re interested in CS + xyz
I will be able to graduate with two majors after changing my degree plan twice and without taking more than 5 regular classes in a semester
You don't need to take 19 credits to graduate unless you're doing some weird stuff
I don't think that requires 19 credits any semester
But don't overcommit to things like ensembles, pe, research, ta positions, etc. either
Because that can make your workload feel like much more than the credits appear
ya the 16 academic credits and 3 ensembles is doing terrible things to me lol
I tried 19 academic credits and an ensemble and had to withdraw from a class this semester :'( a W isn't that big of a deal in the long run, but I could've very easily prevented it by making better choices during registration lol
oh yeah what did you end up withdrawing from?
martens class!
Classical mech made me sad inside
i had him for phys 123 last semester it was chaotic as fuck but he was literally the sweetest
It probably would've been a manageable course if I hadn't also been taking three 300 level math courses, a writing seminar, and yet another class though
No shame in knowing your limits!
That's the private college reality unfortunately, if you feel case has not honored your expected family contribution you can make an appeal, but if they've assessed that based on your family income and assets, you'll just have to decide if it's worthwhile for you to attend
is ohio weather like cali weather
Ohio I find to be more stable in the short term (hours to days) but less stable in the medium term (days to weeks)
thats all i need
The weather rarely varies by more than 20 or so per day but over a week it can go from heavy jacket to shorts
weather for us
Cleveland is nowhere near that bad
from one ohioian to a new one, never trust the weather app/person/forecast. It is almost always very wrong
Late August
The academic calendar is available on the Internet for all such questions
this is genuinely the only time in my life where being poor is a good thing
stem major w/o many classes overlapping with premed does seem hellish
At this point we need a channel for Californians 😭
probably class of 2024 senior HS
have never been inner state
but bay area aint too far off either
I might still be able to pull it to a b but I mean I'm not entirely confident in that
i have a friend in college who got 2 Fs his high school fall semester
And the rest r a bunch of people taking about how they had low grades and didn't get rescinded
Statistically, probably not. Of course aim for the B, but they aren't overly concerned with senior grades as long as they don't show a serious drop in performance (eg. Straight A student to a C average)
Typically I'm an a/b student since I have a 3.6
So since my record already wasn't great I was mildly concerned that a c would make it even worse
Campus is pretty safe. Itâ€™s in the city, so if youâ€™re planning to go for a slow walk at 2am with headphones in whilst on your phone, that may be a bad idea, but in general if youâ€™re on campus thereâ€™s a solid amount of security and police presence. For context, Iâ€™m a guy, but I find walking around campus totally fine even after sundown
yeah sometimes I'll study in the university center till midnight before heading back to the dorms
the lights outside make it feel like it's barely past 7pm and there's enough students walking outside that I've never felt unsafe
Pretty safe, shit happens of course, but it doesn't make me feel concerned for my safety as a student on a regular basis
I don't think it's any worse than any city of a similar size
@ziii2724 just gonna continue here so we dont clog the intro channel :))
im going to temple uni for the semester. its in setagaya, so kinda close to tokyo!
Such a shame I can't go to the admitted student event
Mom can't take off work like that
chainsaw man even more peak
just 3 weeks ago, a student was victim to an armed robbery of their vehicle at night outside of Nord or one of the engineering buildings' parking lot. Was found 2 days later (the car).
About half to a year ago, a saferide driver was robbed behind Leutner commons in their vehicle
There was also an incident just outside of University Hospital's Cleveland Medical Center's Emergency Department in the bushes next to Allen Ford Memorial Lecture Hall (this one you should find on your own)
1 year ago, a car crashed into the pavilion next to Leutner commons. Suspect was trapped in the front door of the vehicle with a weapon.
About 1.5 years ago, a person on Euclid avenue was subject to an armed robbery by a minor (I think ~14 yr old, forgot) in the late morning.
omg zls pfp
Me realizing my dual enrollment credits r gonna be completely useless cause cwru doesn't even accept them
:waaah: all that work and what did it get me
A lot of entry level courses have proficiency exams that you can take and pass for credit
Thank you, I guess since Asians make up nearly 20% of the school, itâ€™s not that hard to find a community if youâ€™re Asian. Itâ€™s definitely a factor Iâ€™m considering.
does anyone think a 5 hour drive to cw is far or should i not think about distance in schools
Iâ€™m roughly a 21 hour drive and I donâ€™t find it an issue
im 6-7 away depending on traffic and its been totally fine
very drivable for move in/out (my parents are busy so ive been flying home for breaks; its a rlly short flight too which is nice) and i dont feel like im right around the corner from home, which i definitely wanted to avoid
i'm like 5'8 and visibly scrawny and weak and i have walked across campus alone and onto euclid at or past midnight many times without any issue
Yeah I don't think I'm going to be in any real danger
every mom will be worried about their kid lol dont take it personally
My mom told me she was worried about me a few minutes ago
Iâ€™ve been here for a year and a half
my dad bought me an entire self defense kit at the start of the fall semester with like pepper spray and flashlights and a small blade and an alarm 💀
i dont think pepper spray is permitted on campus...but eh
That's almost as bad as people calling Rutgers a public ivy not everything needs to be an ivy
So many people at the admitted students fair today
I feel bad for yâ€™all that canâ€™t stand behind the tables lol
checked out the baja table and then left cuz i couldnt get anywhere
Fair enough
Thatâ€™s fair. Is it a 2 day thing?
So you're applied math right
Do you know where the math building(s) are?
ive been doing a weird thing where im thinking abt double majoring in math and engineeringâ€¦
and im seriously considering it
All gone. No more Yost. Goodbye!
Especially because ENGR 145 is a de facto requirement for a math BS anyway
honestly a guide would be greatâ€¦ my flight back home is like at 3? so im leaving around noon
not true (source: math BS)
fair
if you don't know where that is, we can find a place somewhere on the quad
idk what that is
every building on campus is open during working hours pretty much
if anyone else is here n wants to walk around/find stuff/hang out lmk i will take any excuse to not be writing my essay tmrw
I've never been to campus so everything lol. But I guess the stuff that's not on the tour? Thinkbox ofc
thinkbox tours I think they prefer that you sign up for one just cause safety. not sure tho
I am not a Think[box] tech and so I don't have card access 😔
Math department of course 🥰â¤ï¸
damn
there's one with a toilet and a folding chair, and then a couple incredibly close urinals iirc
I don't know how I'll be able to use a bathroom again knowing that it doesn't have dueling toilets..
I went before I committed but it was still really fun. I'd recommend it if you have the time
i have the jeopardy answers if u want them
HUH we didn't get jeopardy
I don't know how fast you can register but come meet up with me next week :D
I would love tooooo!! but i have stupid school to deal with 😩
noooo quit school 😌
I lived in Mistletoe (Raymond to be specific) and to be honest I didn't really like it
I am not because that's scary and I am a coward, but I'd like to help with move-in and I think I'll be in-house by then
So I will be coming back early for that
I am roughly one week away from becoming a Memberâ„¢ï¸ of greek life and don't know the details thereof
dyk if the program goes thru all departments or could i just focus on a couple?
cant speak to specific admitted student events but the campus (especially tink, the university center where all the tours leave from etc) was noticeably way fuller than usual
There are a lot of activities, you don't necessarily need to go to all of them. But campus gets very full and busy during the time because not only are cwru students here, but hundreds of admitted students are all around campus
alright, i was wondering because apparently the cost of a hotel near campus was higher then usual
Recently itâ€™s been Donâ€™t Throw out my Legos
Thatâ€™s been the song Iâ€™ve been starting my car rides back from school on recently
Sorry totally geeking out
But i wanted too but i didnt want to go alone
Omg so lucky!
Did you hear about what happened in Norfolk
What happened??
They had to cancel their concert because the venue couldnâ€™t fit it
the turning outs always make me cry, but im gna say dear winter
weather?
ny is currently hell outside
love the city, hate the suburbs
like baltimore and cleveland are respectable cities without being as massive as nyc is and i like that about them
completely fair
but the airport has gotten a lot better
oh dear
I've found direct flights from Boston to Cleveland to be cheaper then direct flights from LGA to Cleveland the last time I looked at flights. 


But it is probably a bit late for that now 

And I am sure it depends alot on airline
My whole college tour has been terrible in terms of airlinea
I lost my robotics water bottle going through tsa
Idk whats optimal for east coast but for anyone in Colorado/west I would recommend united or southwest. just whatever you do don't fly through ohare that place sucks (i had to sprint through the airport)
nah the weather here is delectable
small but fast hurt like hell 😭
oh well there's your issue
just hoping for a sunny day on monday tbh
no cuz
was about to ask why monday in particular 💀 im a poor excuse for an astro major lol
i was on a flight earlier from boston to cleveland
man that was not a plane ride that was a whole fucking rollercoaster
Weather outside rn. Solidly Grey
Omg ive heard abt it
Isnt it the kinda lazer tagish game that cwru always has
yeah its cool. I haven't done it just cause I know I'd be stressed about it and I want to reduce stress atm, but it definitely seems fun
I know a few people on the "wake up and get to class at 6am so the zombies don't get you" grindset
oh gosh
me personally i am to sleepy but props to them
the problem is at least last sem there were also zombies on the "wake up and camp the quad at 6am" grind so
(the answer to what buildings are connected is all of them, somehow. except the one that everyone kept telling me was connected?)
or if you have a nerf blaster id recommend bringing it to campus in the fall, if youre driving then (i was gonna steal one from my brother over spring break before i realized the tsa would probably not be a fan)
yea gna surprise my parents with an amazon order of socks and nerf shit
We got a flight to Columbus and we are driving to Cleveland
Every single flight out of Boston into NY just got canceled
I didnâ€™t submit it. I think itâ€™s all mostly open houses and you just have to show upâ€” but other ppl feel free to correct me if Iâ€™m wrong
Unfortunately I'm too busy evading zombies this weekend 😭
Im so sad my flight got cancelled â¤ï¸â€🩹
I will not be able to witness the lengendary HvZ battle
Well I'm from LA but my layover flight that went from laguardia to Cleveland got cancled
Bc everything seems to be cancelled in the tri state area 🥲
Anywhere outside and within bounds is fair game
rip charlie
If it helps I've done that drive pretty regularly and it's actually not too terrible all things considered, you take 71 to 490 to SR-10 and that takes you straight to campus
(Source: I'm originally from Columbus and have a car)
It wasn't bad considering I've done the Los Angeles to mammoth ~6 hrs drive before
idk if i have time to go over there 😭 i have to be at hec by 12:45
That's just my personal opinion tho
Luetner has gotten better though. Both of them at this point are not terrible but fribley food is still slightly better
Imo neither of the dining halls are very good, but I have dietary restrictions and a very sensitive stomach
Fribley does beat out leutner by a bit tho
Leut had a terrible couple weeks earlier this year but yeah
Brb cafe also takes regular meal swipes, but they don't have pastrami anymore :(
Donâ€™t do it for the food
Yâ€™all have been selling Greek life since I joined so Iâ€™m trying to figure that out
Fair yea
I'm celiac (can't have wheat) and allergic to eggs and I did fine my first 3 semesters outside of a frat. Honestly for me the fraternity has been slightly worse for my allergies, but I can cook for myself so that's ok
The rooms are actually not bad, but there's only one kitchen for all the floors
This is true. I never tried it, but it's an option
I lived in triangle last semester and I had some epic culinary endeavors
Ya I also didnâ€™t want to spend money outside of the meal plan
so I didnâ€™t cook
also the kitchens are shit
the kitchens are SO DIRTY bc ppl donâ€™t know how to clean up after themselvesâ€¦
I had leut todayâ€¦ is this a good day or bad day
Idk about lunch
Minorâ€” I was actually trying to figure out how impossible Bme and meche would be as a double
I missed the co op for it
Two engineering majors can happen. Lots of people are meche/aero cause itâ€™s like one extra class
mixing BME with anything is very hard, but it is doable, just ease into it
Iâ€™m interested in prosthetics I just donâ€™t know which integrates that better
BME is kinda the way to that. There are also tons of BME majors so you won't be alone. Just expect a challenge
I was once an engineering major. That didn't last
You used to be applied math right?
I felt like I didn't have enough freedom to explore my other interests, didn't like a lot of my classmates, lots of big lectures and weed out courses, not a fan of the "sell your soul" aspect of job hunting, and some other reasons like "not enough math courses"
I changed from applied math because I decided I wanted to double major
I still think some aspects of engineering are cool, but it wasn't really what I realized I wanted out of my college experience
From what Iâ€™ve seen, itâ€™s pretty common to come into college with an idea of what you want to do and then realize you want something else or you can achieve that goal in other more enjoyable ways.
but yeah i have a lot of food issues due to swallowing problems, ibs, and sensory issues so i lost like 10lbs and lived off rascal house with case cash, dunkin, and subway
Oh yikes
but i would recommend trying for the exemption if you have documentation for your issues
nursing building looks sick
Also thisâ€”in case we missed it
just went
i forgot to apply because i was dumb
Or from whenever i finish my exam to 6 (exam should not take the full class)
but aside from that its been fine. nothing outstanding but no problems rlly either. i also got lucky bc as much as i dont know people on my floor, my roommate is cool and apparently storrs 4 is the most chill floor in cedar mag this year lol
nope
i colonize their common area a lot tho
These bathroom ratios r terrible
it looks awful on paper but its actually been fine
as the year goes on you get a feel for the bathroom schedule of your floor. there was only 1 time the entirety of my first year where all the showers on my floor were taken
If the powers that be decide that itâ€™s Global Pissing Hour you might be out of luck but ideally that just doesnâ€™t happen
I feel like this area of the US would probably have a lower amount of students going to top schools with the exception of florida
yeah but they probably want to go to NC state depending on what they're doing
ig i havenâ€™t looked much at regional stats 💀
Yeah 7% seems fitting
The school I go to is like
Terrible
but its so cold outside
holy shit my old school had a glow up
Damn
i wish my school was good
That would work
Surely â€œliving on campusâ€ is something you could talk to me aboutâ€” I donâ€™t have to actually go to that event
I didnâ€™t get to go to sears think box, is it worth going just for that?
Iâ€™ve seen everything else that I wanted to Alr
I might be gone at this point unfortunately
Is it srsly that badâ€¦.
Thats so fair but it sounds so Ominous
i think the clinical experience is intriguing enough tho
oh shucks
Oh lol same but im worried that it would be WORST
I dont think i can handle or even stand it if its even worst than what i do have rn
Umiami is waiting for my FAFSA and their enrollment deposit is due May 1st
like I really like both schools but idk what to do 😭
That doesn't sound like a bad idea
I heard itâ€™s unethical though to submit two deposits
I just want more opinions on my situation and what I should do
I would give a couple more weeks, but if Miami isn't giving you a response in time, I wouldn't bet on it. It's also inadvisable to deposit at two schools, it messes with their numbers
Ok so Case it is then; lowkey I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be used to the floridian culture for the next 4 years either way 😭
all the stuff was due april 1st
but there were still outstanding documents that werenâ€™t fulfilled inside my portal
even though I submitted
they remarked it because it wasnâ€™t correct
UMiami waitlisted me :sad:
it was scary
the rest of the people in my class didnt feel it tho
alqays smth in jersey though
these alarms suck
ik, mad loud for what
yall dont got bodegas up there
there r so many days i wish i lived in the city, cuz i go to skl there
They're alright, I only had a few minor complaints with mine. Tbh you don't spend all that much time sitting in your dorm room anyway
yeah, seems like a hassel
my friend takes the lirr everyday and i couldnt do that
@reddishlightning and @mangnani6 want to meet up near one of the dorms at 2:30?
I donâ€™t have card access to the freshman dorms because Iâ€™m a sophomore but I can show you around the common spaces
I feel like I would
I'm not sure how intensive cs is but from what I hear about it I won't have much time to be having any outside time
I mean, I also preferred to study in places not my dorm because it always felt a bit cramped
Gonna end up being me
Idk how y'all keep up with it
oh
At OX rn I can come to cutter though
i cant
11301 Juniper Rd if you want an address to put in
SORRY
depends on how far apart the majors are but if they're both eng, i don't think its too bad
CS + Bio-med could prove super difficult (different schools + way more different classes) but I'm doing CS + CE and that is 100% possible even though they are in different schools (BSE vs BS)
I used to want to do comp e but like
do we even have a meche minor? i dont see it on the website
When I took physics circuits were so boring I'd drive myself insane doing that for a living
then again i know the applied data science minor exists and i dont see that listed so myabe its incomplete
fair enough lol
I used to want to like
Make gpus and work at Nvidia and stuff
That dream vanished really fast
i swear i dont think it was that bad
It isnt
then it feels kinda scary
fair
you need to have a masters in couter-karenology
How it feels to have proper PPE during Eclipse Day
cuz im back in california and we can only see a partial 😭
dont jinx it!!
Although I guess this could be taken with a grain of salt, he was a freshman during that cycle
dont focus on these reddit communities
Been in it for a year and I never would've even considered applying to cwru without it so
these online communities dont know very much trust me. and all these things are anecdotal so it's not very reliable
They don't know any less than anything else
My opinion doesnt matter to you (it shouldnt, since you dont know me), but i have experience and i know some people. and i know that it's not a great idea to think it's hopeless just from some people online
I'm just saying he's a good applicant and had an egregiously bad win% on it
Plus everybody knows how bad the cs market is rn
Though it might not be so bad by the time '28 starts applying
Sometimes I think I should've applied for that NSA program with the guaranteed internship and job but... I don't really want to work for the gov
and it's not as bad as the memes make it sound
Seems like a big hassle
You won't be able to really mention what you were doing there to any future job because NDAs
Gov shutdowns that have happened like twice in the last year which I'm pretty sure affects pay
i mean it cant be that frequent right
Before you can leave
didnâ€™t know this was a thing
This one also seems similar, I had a fleet admiral recommend the program though they mainly focus on hard science and engineering https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart/en
same deal where you get big stipend for however many years you apply for, paidwork over summer at a job site, then work at a DoD site for the same amount of years you got paid for in the program
a little crescent or a sliver left
oh fuck yea
shit was ass
yeah it aint mine, friend took it
my dad back home in columbus took this and a friend of mine upscaled it a bit
Should've taken stuff in RAW format but oh welll
no need to sue the establishment
I forgot the eclipse was even happening
it doesnt hurt it just leaves an indent like an image of the sun for a couple of seconds
now idk how people just look directly into the sun
isnt that bad
apprently it hurts your retina or smth
yeah, i lowkey have a headache i think its bc i stared too long
kinda stupid imo
the light grey one that has buildings on it and says case western reserve university in a circle around the buildings is still stiff after a year. would not recommend
Really inconvenient
I'm starting to get those videos where people talk about how their school suddenly gets better when they leave

My school suddenly is starting to hire a bunch of interns for different fields for the juniors they never did this when i was a junior :waaah:
i cant wait to leave my school
"our school district is hiring interns for those interested in computer technology" man
im confused why they didnt do it a year earlier so i coulda used it
thats fair
i thought they made it public this year? Idk i heard they changed it a little
12 ppl a year is crazy though
idk if i even could unfortunately the start date overlaps with another event i have
but even if i could i dont think im gonna be one of TWELVE
damn.
u get a 3.5k stipen tho man
get that money
OH NAH NVM
damn that sucks 😭
iâ€™m just trying to make friends â˜¹ï¸
I wonder how many kids even get into case with a -1500 sai though given the whole need aware thing
that isnt for out of state students
cant go :(
I forgot what it's called but the file on our admissions right
This was supposed to be can we
If you get admitted and matriculate,  I think you can but they usually try to remove any data that they don't need after acceptance anyways lol
Usually a liability to have that on hand and most schools remove anything that can be reflected upon as bad
dude ive been here almsot a year and i still make that mistake 💀
I've seen it before but idk what it is
Oh apple only
i downloaded sidechat cuz i thought they were the same thing
i hate applying
Is make some money before college
Don't join CS flee while you still can
Honestly everyone should just be a math major ngl
We can't afford to go on the admitted events
Because unfortunately they're on the same days my mom works
this man has the facilities to draw and quarter several people I would be scared
Also Michael as a math major you should go check out the math building if you have time
when i did it, the room was ~half full
not many ppl asked me questions tho
There were SO MANY people on the chem lab tour
And there was an event going on in the atrium so we couldnâ€™t go in for a while and students were having to figure out some other way in
LMFAO i had to get to my math exam and i just crammed into the elevator with like 10 other kids
we went down literally half a floor to avoid the event
I would hate to be a student during tours, with everything just clogged up with way too many people
it's not bad at all tbh
All Iâ€™m saying is, imagine how awful it would be if there *werenâ€™t* prospective students around this time of year
Also, I checked out to library yesterday, the math and science section is WILD
By the way, Iâ€™m in Tink, so if youâ€™re still around here and want to talk about math here or literally anything, Iâ€™m free
i didnt know dunkin had hot coffees
i thought they quit months ago
It was today before like noon, I was back there a few hours later and they were gone
the only issue is that ppl aren't aware of their surroundings and walk slowly in crowded/narrow spaces which is a bit annoying but otherwise i don't mind
i snuck into a tour group last year
To be honest I forgot that the cleveland institute of art existed
I've never met a CIA student
@jschlanket CS AND MATH
A FELLOW CS AND MATH
💀 idk I just found it lmao
Just wondering but how much do you think a personally signed Dr. Anthony Fauci lab coat would go for?
Am 100% committed but the admissions office refuses to answer my questions about the transfer app :boohoo:
Sorry to hear that though 😔
Like obviously case is the better school but that's still so annoying lmao everything worked out for RIT besides the major
CWRU not accepting by major is the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me tbh
All because I wasn't good enough at math in highschool for them pretty much
:pain:
Too late for that now I comitted
Mine got waivered but again the issue isn't necessarily that I committed
Money is not everything and going somewhere with intent of transferring isnâ€™t very productive or fun
Meaning I'll have lost about 2-3 years
When cs and swe are already 5 year programs
It's rough cause cwru is supposed "full need met" but my full need of -1500 is not being met lmao
It's not a huge deal cause besides RIT cwru is still my cheapest option by a fairly large margin
If cwru had given me -1500 like the FAFSA says I need I wouldn't be tripping cause the difference would be -1500 vs -2100 but the difference is -2100 vs 3k
why dont you like case?
i visited there and realized i didnt wanna do chem
It's not too late, it's still April. Go somewhere else if you don't want to go lol
Like why consign yourself to something you think you would hate?
Then extra why are you here if you hate the school
The core of my confusion was first, why talk about transferring if you haven't gone here yet, which obviously doesn't apply if you're already a freshman. But then, if you're a freshman, why join a server not for your graduating class to talk about transferring with people who haven't even gone here yet? Like what can you possibly gain from this
Your perspective is valid because it's your experience, but I hope you realize the irony in posting a huge message about why you dislike it here just after we all agreed that providing perspective is helpful but not in this sort of way. It seems like you only joined this server to say bad things, and not even in response to anything in particular
juxtapose this with lindseys account of going off campus like once a week (without a car, afaik) and you get a sense of how wildly different experiences at the same school can be!
the gray definitely gets to me but mostly like itll be sunny and warm for a day and ill be like oh this is so much better, less so that im actively noticing the gray and being consciously affected by it? it hasnt bothered me too much. idk everyone will take the same conditions differently is the moral of the story
This. 

College is an inherently difficult thing to objectively evaluate because the vast majority of people only have direct experience with one school. 

There was someone my freshman year (I think he transferred, I hope he transferred) who complained all the time that all his high school friends were having way more fun at college than him and that he hated it here. He sucked to be around. 

There are times in college that aren't ideal. Cleveland is a rust belt city. It can be hard to meet people. Classes are hard. Case administration is far from perfect. The food can be mediocre. Etc. 

But honestly I think most of the complaints apply to many other colleges and ultimately it's about finding the right place. 

Personally I find Cleveland to be a vibrant city. I love biking around. I love the huge metro park system. I love the RTA. Going out downtown or Little Italy or Coventry is a lot of fun. 

I generally think the classes are solid. I love the design teams and thinkbox and by sophomore year I was really starting to find a solid friend group I really vibed with. 

I don't want it to seem like I am trying to negate anyone's honest negative experience but I don't think this is the place to publicly air dirty laundry and I think that Studyacc's experience is not reflective of the average case experience and could happen at any school. 

:3
also like idk the us is largely an unfriendly place without a car and cleveland isnt any worse than baltimore in that regard (i cant compare it to anything else, not having lived elsewhere)
i will say rta can be a bit ass depending on where you want to go
I really like the RTA especially since i come from a city where buses are a novel concept due to how car centric it is
The weather doesn't affect my mood
I don't like the outside anyway
Not being able to get around without a car is unfortunate though
I don't live in Ohio so it's not like I can just
Have a car here
Iâ€™m getting my car shipped from Texas to Ohio
I have had an extreme amount of issues getting places when I need to without my car
Iâ€™ve spent like $200+ on Uber this year
Unless I like idk
If I go back to south Carolina in the summer cars would probably be cheaper
If I'm lucky and get internship money or something 😭
Even though half of it would go to affording this school :waaah:
wtf rly
I rly need to
i just got asked to ta out of the blue last semester
the prof isnâ€™t teaching next semester so idk 💀
like 11-13 by department an hour max 10 hours a week
That's not bad
I don't think I personally am going to be paying much for cwru
But still better to have money than not
I'll still have to figure out work study and loans
Maybe if I get lucky during the inevitable internship/co op hell that will be summer of sophomore year I won't have to work study
fascinating discourse that I missed in #general darn
just weird how someone that's the end of their bloodline feels the need to project
i don't know what the message sent before they left was
The correlation is still jus
I didn't think it was deleted I thought he got banned
Nope no one has been banned
he didn't say anything that provoked an 'incel' insult
\> since been deleted
The 2 meme images he sent don't imply inceldom either
None of you (except Adam)saw the message that Studyacc deleted (it was not the "mog" one). And I deleted my message within a couple minutes because I decided it went too far based off one message the person clearly regretted sending and deleted right away. 


Also while it is not particularly relevant my BF and I have been happily dating for 6 months and I don't give a fuck about my "bloodline" thank you very much.
hey! i'm currently debating if it's worth buying an ipad for notetaking (future computer science major, bs i guess if it matters somehow for this question), my main argument being that i prefer to keep all my notes digital on my laptop and i don't want to carry tons of paper on me all the time. so if someone could provide me an insight into the benefits of such a move and whether i'm gonna need "physical notes" for some classes, i'll be very grateful
Math classes I find easier for physical notes because writing math notation is definitely possible but harder to do in real time
You donâ€™t have Cary 10000 notebooks
But you donâ€™t have to get an iPad
Other similar tablets do work just as well imo and donâ€™t cost 1000 dollars
I'm a 10,000 notebooks fan personally. Paper notes are fantastic and I love them. I know some people who can take notes on tablet or yoga computer and it seems to work for them. I'd recommend trying it out cause for me its a texture thing (I need the feeling of pen on paper to be able to think) and just see what works for you!
I do have to say I miss having that one aspect of my life not on screens
Sometimes I revert to pen and paper because I miss having more screen-free study time
Also Iâ€™ve seen suggestions not for lectures but for studying sessions that if you want that non-paper quick writing feel a whiteboard can also substitute that sometimes
whiteboards are very nice for working through problems
(i'm a math major i need to eat chalk)
The texture is so bad
it's easier for me to study from my laptop and also have my notes accessible anywhere if i'm having a boring day at work or wherever
Same. I feel like it'd be delicious life changing
there's hagoromo in the basement........... so close
good chalk doesnt mean it tastes good tho
and if stuff doesn't work then go back to how u were doing it before
i'm already close to this tbh
i've got to find a video one moment
Yeah but what if I want strong bones?
i got a 2 in 1 laptop and have very much changed how i do notes depending on the class. for math classes writing with it is essential to me but in other classes typing notes so i can keep up with whats going on is beneficial too
most profs don't care at all
this scared me
i switched from paper to an ipad first semester and i honestly think it was the best decision i made
although it may be bc i never really loved paper notes in the first place..but its been much easier to organize and submit as a notetaker
oop that didnt reply to the intended message 💀
not this. dont do this
speaking of chalk (no), is someone gonna care by what time i'm in dorms or whether or not i'm there for the weekends (my home's 15mins away don't get me wrong there's a temptation)?
nobody cares except maybe your roommate if you get back super late at night
I know bc I am at a boarding school
proven math major calculating the time for the walk
And one of them cuz our room's alarm decided to go off for no reason 😭
It is always slightly concerning that I would probably perish in an actual fire but most times someone burnt their ramen or is 🍃
Living away from home core
A majority of the school
Kinda an internet meme
Unfortunately this is our mascot
scary ah
go spartans tho!
My school was no mascot unfortunately
We do have actual bears though bc itâ€™s in the middle of nowhere
my friend told me he looks hot
Your friend is wrong
Very wrong and I am concerned for them /j
No shame in having a thing for buff white guys
ive been taking notes on paper but doing homework digitally (prompted largely by my physics prof requiring a new page for every question, which feels like a waste of paper) and thatâ€™s been working for me
Just for shits and giggles idk itâ€™s not that deep
OMG i didnâ€™t know thereâ€™s a video thatâ€™s so good
I feel like Iâ€™ve heard about this before, but I never saw the video until nowâ€¦ kinda surreal to see bro just take a good bite out
My middle school 💀
Canâ€™t escape Sparta
Good then, seems like they havenâ€™t changed it
sucks for west coasters but not as bad as 7am est would be
class reg in july?
One of my professors says this often and I want to use it more so
omg i went to all those places too last summer during a school spain trip
i want to this summer tho
Barcelona was nice but it did feel a bit different to the other cities, felt more â€œTraditionally Europeanâ€ to my Latinamerican eyes I guess
Idk either mb
I just dropped a bad question mark 💀
U saw nothing
I donâ€™t even know what anymore
Fair
Rip
Isnâ€™t Catalan technically more related to Occitan than Castilian?
It's all messy because much of Spain, France, and Italy were basically a dialect continuum until the last couple centuries with no clear borders between languages or dialects
internet says that catalan is closer to french
L cant select all of em
case closed 💼
Someone said I could use my RIT fin aid offer to negotiate w cwru but knowing cwru
u miss 100% of the shots u dont take
I said this but cwru actually explicitly states you canâ€™t use other scholarship offers to negotiate
I've already planned around tanking the money
Went through all that trouble w the FAFSA just for the college I'm going to to not even use it
The joys of college
That seems like such an awkward back and forth
Id rather pay money than have a weird conversation w them
they fr told me to consider my other options if I didnâ€™t like their offer
my cousin got an extra 5k or so from her grad school by negotiating w another school's offer but i havent heard it work for undergrad
I pestered them every single week since May 2023 and all they did was give me an extra loan after I begged them for help when I lost my job 💀💀💀
Damn nice
So here's the deal: Case and WPI have almost the same undergraduate population, however, Case feels much, much bigger. This is for a few reasons:
- There is more diversity at Case in people and in majors. Case is not only an engineering school, it's also a nursing school, a pre-med school, has a strong liberal arts department, tons of math, and science research. On the other hand, WPI is pretty focused on STEM and they are quite strong in that.
- Case also feels bigger because the campus is physically much, much larger. Going across the WPI campus takes about 5-10 minutes while Case can take up to 30 minutes. There are more buildings and just more places around the area to go (in Cleveland vs Worcester, Cleveland has more to do generally)

Because of this and Case having more money in general, there is more to do around the school including think[box], research in literally anything, short term and long term study abroad in whatever you want, etc.

On the other hand, Case misses out on how specialized and personal WPI is. At Case you have to find what you want to do and pursue it while WPI will really help each student more and there's much more of a track to follow. Because of how specialized WPI is, it also feels more "built for you" if you are a STEM major. You can almost be sure the next big investment at WPI will be STEM focused, while at Case it could be STEM, medicine, English stuff, etc.

In the end, I chose Case because my mom went to WPI and many of my friends were going to WPI too. This along with how specialized WPI was made it so it felt very safe and familiar and like a place I wouldn't actually grow at. Case on the other hand excited me more and I generally really liked the people here and knew that they would challenge me because of how different they were from me.

Sorry for the giant word salad, but those are my thoughts, let me know if you have any more questions.
Also, am I supposed to be able to access the student information system yet, or do I have to wait?
How it feels when you find a research paper with an abstract that perfectly supplements your literature review, but it's locked behind a paywall
How it feels to write a 4000 word essay with a deadline minus 3 days ago, but you found a meta-analysis that is literally a copy-paste of your desired paper
How bad is it?
I don't think so lol
I'm not an engineer so I would have no idea how to do this but damn this sounds like fun to make
Have you tried swinging a dead cat
surely they wont notice a couple missing
I feel like at cwru you'd find more premed kids than engineers
any other engineering tho, why not
left or right
left
Left
Also if u felt like u were too nerdy to fit in in high school u prob will feel right at home at case
Fraternity president is not necessarily a highly desirable position 😭 it's mostly just a lot of fucking work
Most executive positions have a very skewed work vs prestige ratio towards the former
Frat guys and shit
I don't plan on joining a frat idk what the like
I don't gain much
depending on the nerdiness i might be able to help
hmm this implies 3 nested for loops
i think this can be done in two with proper subfunctions and data management.
designing this would unfortunately be to much thinking at 2am.

The general thought is a separate function that uses recursion to set up arithmetic subarrays.
This would still require two loops so O(N^2*logN) could be doable
im sorry. 
this is the one field of knowledge i want to study
didn't get any email confirmation but I guess it's just the way it should be lol
it's been like 20 mins and the only thing I got was a reminder about the deposit so idk
do you know by any chance when I'll be able to confirm or decline my fin aid?
Spartie broke my door down like hagrid
youre so right im so sorry spartie
my bad dawg
it seems like they do this stuff by physical mail
they did NOT send me any goodies (too broke to afford international shipping i see)
i did get a pack of cards from discover week tho
Wtf thatâ€™s messed up
I can bring you the broken stapler (it was very shit quality) next semester if you want â¤ï¸
aint no way the tuitions originally 90k....
they should have enough money
i used to joke in HS that most of our tuition would go to our head of school's clothing collection cuz not once did i see her wear the same set of clothes
it felt like they were still trying to sell the skl to me so i was laughing when i saw it
holy shit an actual 100% on an english paper
Havenâ€™t seen one of those since 9th grade
i got the english award thign at senior awards ceremony and ive never gotten one of those 💀
i have got one of those in my life and it was last sem cause i had a really really nice prof
unfortunately it did not 😭
that isn't too bad tbh all things considered. -1500 is the lowest you can get on their scale and the floor might be a little high

that is what I got and I pay quite a bit more; they heavily hinge your app on the CSS profile as well since it goes much more in depth with assets and stuff
With work study, you can pay off that 3k with no problem across 2 semesters- it is actually quite a good deal; there are a lot of oppertunities around campus and you shouldn't have any issue finding somewhere that is more laid back
Yeah, it was hosted at the air and space museum last year and like 80 teams went
if i dont get rescinded my college gpa isnt gonna be too hot 😭
You won't get rescinded for a C, it'll be ok 👍
I had a C in math and chem my last semester they didnâ€™t do shit😂
Ive never gotten a C before, and im probably gonna get 2 this semester
took me long enough 💀
I was mostly comparing it with my state school though, everything else would've been way too expensive
any car mechanics willing to teach me how to do an oil change
My dad works on his car a ton (and I help were I can) and its all youtube
Most are pretty dead though
I don't know of any truly huge cwru server
Would probably be hell to moderate
Yeah, the class year discords are unfortunately the closest to that available
and i assume the older ones die out as new ones get created
Idk how much of the cs population of seniors per year that us
So last year
cwru awarded 55 BAs in cs and 86 BSs in the 2022-2023 school year
Damn so that's like
aint no way
I'm really hoping that having a sample size that small will give me some typa advantage
oh head empty
i dont know why I expected more CS majors
Well it's cs everyone wants to do it
yeah my perspective is skewed i imagine the school to be bigger than it really is
class size has gone up by about 200 since then tbf
where my fellow computer engineers at 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
it feels really big ngl
maybe i just dont go outside
I wanted CE but circuits and stuff r so
I took physics and even though I got a 97 on the midterm it was even more unfun than math classes were usually
I couldn't do that for 4 more years
Idk why there was a midterm
i had a midterm last Friday and my final for the same class on this Friday
mid end term
Also idk where I said it
no ASS university though
Idk if I should keep it or give it to my counselor
Unfortunately cwru has not sent me anything else 😭😭
If it was just a flag id give it to her a whole banner is a lot tho
Not bad
I've never actually lived in a house
but damn
Feel like starting off on a 3.6 is even more dangerous
Idk how worth it transferring my credits is though
i worked under an astro phd who was telling me how he wishes his daugher (cs major) would spend less time on her schoolwork and more time on research projects
but thats anecdotal so idk
If I don't transfer classes
I'm starting from a 4.0 and working down
If I do I'm starting from a 3.6
It wasn't even updated it said revised 3/14 😭
Damn
3k after federal loans/work study
I just don't get why they
They looked at it really hard and thought you should know ig lmao
wtf
There may well be a few in this server but idk
I just want to know if it's possible to graduate in 3.5 semesters
honestly just hit up people in DMs whenever someone identifies as a spring admit
dont be afraid to make friends with fall admits over discord (or when you get here), but do understand that when you get here youll have to put in extra work to making friends with the other spring admits at orientation so u wont be lonely the first week
yes but many spring people i know arent trying to
um I think its possible - the one thing about biochem is you do get bottlenecked because you need orgo to take like any of the biochem classes so you def would want to try and have ap chem credit. If you dont its not the end of the world - a sophomore biochem student I know has told me that you can request an overide into some of the biochem classes even if you don't have orgo.
Oh I just remembered this
I remember the pain
College classes at HS basically
and for the record APs are nothing like actual college classes (source: I took many APs)
I remember ap exams
Ap exams suck more than college exam usually
Tho stats and gov don't cover and credits, so not gonna go to the actual test 🤣
I have three finals, two papers, and a poster presentation left
Which sounds bad until you realize one final I can turn in a blank piece of paper for and get an A, one paper is already done, and the poster is also finished
May ur soul rip 🙏
The AP physics exam was certainly something
I took one final today, then I have a presentation to prepare, 13 pages to write between 3 different classes, and 1 more final exam
.....and u thought AP exams were worse
Ugh, pls tell me all these classes get easier at case 😭
Really depends on the class
PHYS 123 (the "hard" mechanics) was way easier than high school mechanics
.........fuck that, I'mma just od before taking that class tyvm
Ah fair enough, it very much id competitive ranking
Ah fair enough
So you have a lot more one-on-one instruction, an entire year to learn things, and usually more time spent just going over "ap style practice problems"
College is diff to that how?
College is a lot more self directed. You go to lecture 2-3 times a week, then work through problem sets at your own pace and have more flexibility to figure out what you need to do. Exams are usually worth more of your final grade, and college courses require a higher out of class investment. Classes like calc or physics are also huge, so you need to go to student instructor sessions or office hours if you want one-on-one help
I would also say that as classes go on, you really get out what you put in. Some high-level classes for example, the grade is entirely homework + final project, with no exams at all. I am learning a lot about the material because I research in the area, but if you wanted to sit in the class and learn next to nothing you theoretically could do just that
I've got a class that is 25% quizzes and 75% exams, of which there are 3.
I would say that most of the college exams I've taken have been more straightforward than an ap exam would've been
I've also had very few professors who have multiple choices exams. Some will have mcq sections, but honestly those are worse than the written responses imo
I have almost never had multiple choice questions, I think only in 1 class and that was mostly defining terms
Complex analysis multiple choice questions make me sad inside
technically butler's math 122 had an mcq when we had to figure out the equation that matched the slope field
Adding on to the question before. It really depends on your high school. I find college much harder than high school but it's a different kind of hard because you're living it. So even though you may do many hours of work a day for college classes it doesn't feel that bad because you are in an environment where you are living in college so it becomes more part of your life if that makes sense
^About how hard college work and exams are
Also like, you have to take care of yourself. As a first year you donâ€™t Need to cook or anything but like, itâ€™s your job to self-regulate and that makes it a lot tougher sometimes cause you canâ€™t just sit down and say â€œokay I need to learn and get this doneâ€ and someone else will be there to make sure youâ€™re getting enough to eat and remembering to get outside etc. You NEED to be taking care of yourself as you work
for me I would say that college is a different kind of difficult. Like high school is hard because there is so much school - for me it was 6 and a half hours 5 days a week plus at least an hour of after school activities. And then after that its go home and do hw. College there is more free time (if you get a good schedule) but you have to be super disciplined at using that time well otherwise the nights before large assignments are due will not be fun.
im ngl seeing that email scared me
i feel like im not old enough for this 😭
I felt the exact same way - I was terrified to come to college. Now I don't want to leave. I'm not saying that that will be your experience or that you shouldn't be scared. Your fear is 100% valid and all of us felt that way. Just in my experience the fear doesn't last.
i have a feeling the fear wont last for me either, but at this moment i still feel like a ninth grader lmao
its a weird in between feeling
that's so early
I know this is a rather big question, but I need to decide between engineering and pre med and I really don't know what to choose. Anyone willing to offer advice?
i guess it really just comes down to what you are interested in (clichÃ©, i know)
pre-med is tough as hell and with the added stress of MCAT and of course the necessary volunteering/shadowing/interning in order to even try to stand out among all med school applicants is a lot; but if it is something you are truly passionate about, then whatever requirements you need to fulfill will just...come naturally and easily
medicine is a really gratifying career path to pursue- and engineering could be applied to it as well if that is something you could consider~ i'd hate to say that you need to drop one thing you're passionate about, ideally you could combine them :3
cwru is an exceptional school for both areas, and some of the early engineering and pre-med classes are similar (CHEM 111 vs CHEM 105 for example), so i would say maybe before making the choice, you give it a try first and explore a bit- good thing about case is that you don't declare until end of october iirc

tldr medicine is hard but if it's something you are seriously considering, go for it! and case is a great interdisciplinary school so combining both pre-med and engineering isn't impossible nor is it extraordinarily difficult; my advice would be to first hold off on the choice and take a few classes first from both areas first semester, then if it seems doable, continue! if not, find the area that you're more passionate about
you could spare a few slots first semester to explore a bit i guess~~ class registration is torture for pre-meds, another thing i should mention
there's just so many of us 😭
Hm, I really appreciate the time you put into your response. Maybe this is TMI but I have parents who sort of pushed being a doctor my whole life, and I never really got a chance to explore anything else. blah blah blah. Simply put, I don't know what I'm passionate about. I know this is a case server, but I'm actually still deciding between going to UW for Comp Engineering or Case for pre med 💀 . For me, I'm just worried that I'm gon to hate the biology and chemistry classes, especially considering one of my friends who was premed switched to chem e after being sick of memorizing stuff for her bio major. Also, my older brother had a premed horror story as a bio major and his gpa after freshman year was like a 2 smthn.
ah~ pre-med definitely is difficult to be just something you can commit to without any personal investment
have you taken any bio/chem classes in high school? although they aren't 100% comparable, if you had any interest in the topic, that would be a start! this also applies to comp engineering
also objectively speaking, career and salary-wise, doctors are something that is never going to go out of demand
and i might be biased towards cwru, but if you commit and then decide you hate the bio and chem, it's extremely easy to switch to comp eng with little to no consequence
and you also have the whole summer, although it will be after you need to make your choice, getting your feet wet in the area can't hurt~ find an internship or smth and see what it feels like
(also congrats on getting accepted into UW :3 i'm sure whichever you choose, you'll do amazing~)
i think ive gotten 50 follow requests in the last 5 hours
neither, premed is a pyramid scheme and you're gonna hate yourself as an engineer until you get your MBA in like 2 decades
Iâ€™m still a dance minor 💅
Or both good and bad
i wanna do emergency or flight emergency
oh nicee
Just don't fail your classes or commit a felony or something
If you want to, but I can't guarantee any expertise. Maybe ask an admissions officer for the school
not really
as long as you don't like fail a class or something
its gonna take a bit to get your offer rescinded they want your money at the end of the day
theyve given you an offer, they haven't spent any resources and money on you yet
let alone yourself
dont fail or commit a crime
your scholarship shouldn't be in jeoprady, i think you have to fail pretty sensationally to get it rescinded
hey i anyone else is in ap stats, micro econ, lit, or phys C mech and wants a study buddy hmu 😊
i got 3 on it last year
I hate that case only takes a 5 for stats is it so terrible that I wanna skip the one math requirement for nursing 😭
Anyone here taking BC?
i can help people with stuff for stats, micro, lit, phys C mech, BC, or CSA if anyone wants
APs suck u got this
i can help with bc and thats about it 💀 also took stats and csa but lord knows i didnt learn anything in those classes
Im doing Phys C, 2 and E&M (im gonna fail E&M), Calc AB, Compsci A, and Lit
i love lit! (i didn't take the AP lit exam cause i already had lang and the idea of an English AP exam is really fucked up actually)
Am I stupid or is the 2nd half of this like pretty rough
none of those look that bad
Actually looking back itâ€™s not horrible
I didnâ€™t get bound erros
yeah that is fair. the question effectively just says: 
you are dealing with a convergent alternating series. talk to me about its error
C and D got to me for this one although polars arenâ€™t my strong suit
I got a point for just know the polar area formula but I donâ€™t think I couldâ€™ve gotten the other two in the exam
Cause tan(theta)=y/x=m
or no nvm but its the entire right half of the plane
still the idea of "what if i make my circle so big that its just the entire half of the plane" is very funny
Lowkey calc BC light except the silly little things here and there
did ap review questions get way harder since last year or did i get dumber
I'm gonna fail econ I haven't even touched it bc of stats
lowkey kinda worried about stats, i was bitter that my school doesnt offer calc bc so ive not been paying the best attention
Stats scares me bc ive done all this prep and I'm one of few in my class with an A but everytime I do practice tests I fail them
we have never done a full practice test
Omg the mcqs are so bad
im saying this having gotten a 5 on calc ab last year
stats mc just mess with your head
if anyone wants to group study for stats i will probably be spending tomorrow night on it
i was expecting stats to go terribly (didnt study a ton, and my hs stats class wasnt an ap class but rather for kids who were taking 2 math classes/couldnt keep up with the standard precalc-calc trac, so we didnt rlly learn chi square or linear regressions (?) or anything) and i got a 4. i believe in you !!
omg i took stat last year and got a 3! i was really burnt out and stopped trying around january but i crammed and passed- just study chi square and stuff learnt later in the year, it was more prevalent tha n i thouight
if u want them
Idk, Sam D (MechE/Math '28)
bc is gonna be the death of me
but only taking the stats exam
I'm just ignoring all my problems and making bracelets instead
I'll understand math enough to make math dad jokes
Math minor 🤔
Stats, micro, BC, and CSA all got me out of classes. Phys C mech couldâ€™ve but I decided to take 123 instead so it didnâ€™t do anything. CSP did nothing, and lang gave me some English credit but didnâ€™t replace any class
Y'all think cwru would pay for my plane ticket there
Idk if they would to actually go
I live in south Carolina n they were gonna pay for my flight for admitted students day so now I'm just wondering if they'll pay for my flight to move in 😭
ohh yea no im on basically a full ride n the finaid office said they cant help w that
they payed for my flight to admitted students asw
Damn alr
I never went
nad it wasnt a money thing either it was on southwest + they sent us the reciept nad it was 1.1k for the flight
Sucks
Like the drive isn't horrible we're like 10 hours away?
yea ikm like 6 hrs away
im in philly but yea they do and with the money they spent which was over 1k i feel like they were going out of their way to waste money and make the trip terrible for us 💀
Oh yeah they do direct to philly as well but still a lil bit mad
what even aer the grad requirements/?? im so lost at these bread requirements im just tryina see if i have to take calc 2 or not
Iâ€™m from mass and my drive is the same length. I drove up and it wasnâ€™t actually that bad and as everyone else said I got to bring more stuff so I would recommend driving for move in and flying back whenever u visit home for breaks.
everyone needs a senior/capstone project to graduate
Honest question, why do I hear some advice of â€œDonâ€™t wear your lanyard as a college freshmanâ€?
For one, it falls off easily and you could lose your id. Two, it just looks silly
it was hot and annoying
feels harder to lose that way + if im in my dorm and going in and out a bunch with my hands full (washing dishes/water bottle/whatever) its convenient to have it wearable
Eating on regular meal swipes, my favorite was brb cafe. But they have limited hours and don't have pastrami sandwiches anymore :(
Without meal swipes, I am a big fan of Dunkin and Einstein's for places conveniently in campus buildings
i used a lot of case cash at the starbucks in nrv last year
that's why i don't go to dennys anymore
How we feeling about ap stats yall?
I did see a girl doing that last year, idk if she still does
I have roller skates. I want to continue the legacy but I would like to also not end up with a neck brace
idk bc I do not take it but I hope it goes well for ya!!!
My school isn't very smart
Itâ€™s a work of fiction
Die Scanner
Iâ€™m actually more cooked for ap German exam probably
Next Friday is going to suck I have ap German, ap physics, and then a senior cruise thing
I already know Iâ€™m going to write the worst poetry analysis tomorrow
After like  7 hours of AP exams I will be a broken man
Omg same I'm so cooked
But yknow what weâ€™ll be okayy everyone else probably thought it was hard too!
nah math is my worst subject and i havent been paying super great attention in class most of 2nd sem
ill cut the loss and take the L 🙏
aint the average super low tho
you could probably still get a 5
If you're taking bc you can still get out of math 1 with a 5 AB subscore
sorry bc as in because LOL
i have a bunch of quizlets i made to study for the ap last yr: https://quizlet.com/Stephanie_Hsu_/folders/ap-psychology?i=tpozm&x=1xqt
I did both exams and I'm so tired
im feeling 4/5 for both
but it wasn't that bad honestly
Stats was so weird for me bc I'd finish the exam and then check my answers.and then be confused about wtf I was doing
Good luck to the compsci A nerds and Lit nerds tmrw (Im one of the nerds and imma fail)
Me following all the class pages for cwru knowing damn well I won't post to any of them
I still get emails from the civil engineering department
np! gl on the exam!!
He says you don't. "Plenty of members don't have one"
One major thing we do in motorcycle club is work on fixing up an old 1974 triumph Bonneville at a local DIY garage
BROOO i wanna race someday omg
These are pics I took at various points over the last week
oh what the
This is the CWRU crime records. You can see here that the cases are closed (dropped charges), but they still recorded the arrests
There are also a small handful of counter protesters (mostly not CWRU students or faculty). Some people in the protest are not students either which was one of the major issues. On Thursday, they marched up to the quad to put a note on a door and come back.
this doesnt affect job opportunities later on....?
cuz they did nothing wrong
I mean I assume some kids did something wrong
My coach told me if the Palestine protesters actually wanted to do something theyâ€™d pack their bags and fly out instead of sitting in the US 💀
oh what the fuck
forgot that part
i never got to see what was there so idk what was written there
I wonâ€™t speak for the protest at large, but those people on the ground being ziptied factually didnâ€™t do anything wrong
what the fuck
but also i have been pretty shutin recently so correct me if im wrong
Did case say what university rules were broken
they said ksl oval is now closed leave and then people stayed
Netinyahu doesnâ€™t care Rutgers calls for a ceasefire
they also tried to affect this through some student gov legislation last year but it was written in a way that caused a lot of issues and the university said they would not honor it
the gov is what needs to take action rn
naw the gov dont care abt college students 😭
Whatâ€™s gonna happen when summer break happens
its not just college students anymore i dont think
idk if any of this is gonna lead to action done in time
But most of the news id argue is from college campuses
cuz realistically almost all of gaza is in rumbles
the hypercorporatism rly isnt helping
We need to have an age max for presidents
both of them are equally shit
And all people running for president need to pass a civics exam
the media paints trump as a villain but heâ€™s not too shit
Not in time to prevent loads of horrific tragedies and war crimes beyond our imagination that are currently happening. But definitely in time to stop them from continuing to happen months from now.
In my opinion, Biden is horrible for many reasons. But to say heâ€™s as bad as trump is to ignore so much extra suffering. Not only does trump more actively make things worse than Biden does in the most critical issues. But he also blatantly threatens our democracy and the most fundamental principles of the country.
Both are bad just each has their pros
we need a woman elect im ngl
we need a new fucking system
cuz this is two centuries too old
like why hasnâ€™t there been a woman as president 😭
idk
before anyone says "except for obama" so was he
fuck he ordered air strikes the day he came into office
im so fed up with whats been going on recently tho
shit these days not working at all
oh fuck 😭
If i see another "cwru or x school" post I'm gonna go insane
I like understand tho, I was a few minor things away from making a post. If I didn't find this discord I probably would have
Fair enough but so many of them
Seem so obvious
"do I go to cwru (30k more expensive) or insert y school here"
Cause there's a disparity between CMU and cwru in most things
But 90k vs 60k is crazy work
Case was the only school that offered me money with just my CSS
and couldnâ€™t do it without FAFSA
I got my cost down to 3K a year with work study
That's their minimum apparently
They don't go lower lmao
Just speculating though
damn 38K?!?
I got a higher grant cus im poor 💀
so i guess it balances out
wtf
Am I cooked or were you not a math major earlier
If I didn't apply to cwru
I didn't want to write supplementals though
iirc the uroch essays from my application cycle were bad
YOOOOO MATH
I like math a very normal amount
I mean, at least it's math
but I realized I am not fond at AP Physics C
Yeah, I was a TA for it the last two semesters and I may be next semester. It is a lot more information than AP CS, but not necessarily needed. It basically covers AP CS in the first half of the semester then the second half is a lot more advanced Java stuff. It's worth taking if your AP class just taught you the test and nothing more, but if you're very comfortable with Java then you could probably skip it without much consequence
It is known as a pretty challenging CS class, but manageable especially because there are tons of TAs and office hours. It's also a lot of work but the grading on all that work isn't that hard so it balances out
I canâ€™t write code for my life
Iâ€™m thinking about applied math or cs
probably take the class then. Coding isn't very useful unless you can do it
You could do both math and CS 🥰
but Iâ€™m just scared I wonâ€™t understand it 😭
cause Iâ€™m struggling rn
And I am the biggest math nerd of all time right now
bro im getting fisted in my bc class rn
MATH
Jake you saw nothing
I got my AP test on monday so gotta lock in this weekend
godspeed. we are here to help if you need
(No I donâ€™t have ten math books in my suitcase for my flight home, donâ€™t ask)
Taking CSDS 132 is probably the best way to find out if you want to be a CS major imo
Also, at the higher level, CS classes start to be more and more math
Seriously though, calculus can be tough stuff and if you donâ€™t instantly get it itâ€™s okay
Fourier is applied linear algebra and basically all applied linear algebra either requires abstract algebra or calculus
My issue with math
Is that it seems like the harder the concept the easier I get it 😭
I just can't do
It's like I'm missing a large amount of math fundamentals so the harder concepts that are somewhat separate from those I do fine in but the ones that apply basics we should've learned freshman year I just don't get
Iâ€™m in Oâ€™Hare airport right now and I just got flipped off by a five-year-old
I was just walking so I donâ€™t think so
ohare really stays losing
Also with me walking 5 minutes to a McDonaldâ€™s and finding they donâ€™t take cash
rip that sucks
i have had only terrible experiences with layovers in ohare
Math? Who would major in such a silly subject?
Math is cringe
He probably just learned about that finger today and wanted to show you just in case you didn't know
Idk I'm probably less of a math nerd than some people, but I did write 25 pages on polyhedra this semester
Most of the answers will come down to, it's a smaller, nerdier school than OSU, but there is still plenty to do around campus
i was at cleveland hopkins 4 hours ago
Fucking shit, unless youâ€™re tight with the right people
Damn 😭
Iâ€™ve never been to a function so Iâ€™d assume Case would fit my lifestyle
Everything under the traditional parties exists at CWRU though
Easier to meet people since thereâ€™s already a common interest with teammates etc
Doesnâ€™t everyone lmao
I feel like high school is just so confined to popularity
I need to find friends too lol
Now I know what youâ€™re thinking: â€œdoes it have AC for the hot summer months? Can I-â€œ no it does not, I am crying
Also if anyone wants a mini-fridge for next year I can hook you up
DU has like 6 extras that we are trying to find homes for
maybe five, i just asked my roommate if she wants one 🙂
Also if your parents are the type of people to buy you a bunch of random stuff because youâ€™re going off to college I highly recommend trying to discourage buying things you will probably never use, it only makes moving more annoying, especially if you have to store things over the summer
Do you guys think a car is necessary on campus?
It can be nice sometimes, but you definitely wonâ€™t need to use it day-to-day
I was here without a car and almost all of my friends didnâ€™t have cars and it was totally fine. Second semester I spent more time with brothers who had cars and it was cool, but definitely not necessary. Iâ€™d at least give it a semester before you bring it up to see how much you would be using it, cause car break-ins and whatnot are the most common crimes on campus, so it ought to be worth it if you bring it up
damn
If you want to go further out, having a car is advisable
If me not too late me too :0
How hard is it to go to a sports game?
Lmao learn from my pain
If you hate walking and taking your car to campus is convenient, consider it. Otherwise, you'll probably be fine freshman year without one. Later on it becomes more desirable to have a car just because you'll probably have more things to do off campus
My floor didnâ€™t have one so the brita saved time and was useful for me
I live in Columbus and to me it depends a lot on your lifestyle. I had commitments in the fall that I wanted to come back to Columbus for so I brought mine. I almost never used it on campus until my second year.

IMO if you don't think you're gonna go back home 2-3 times outside of breaks, don't bother, especially if you end up making plans with friends for fall break.
I was invited to boys state, didn't want to go lol
though I would've gotten down in the contract law
Did anyone here volunteer for the last Model UN spring conference
never had the chicken but we can grab some
Damn. The new generation of math majors will never know yost
Yost was the math department building but they're currently tearing it down to make a new biomed research building
omg columbus gang rise up 😤😤
i gotta get some melon pan ive missed it so much
no frankly i donâ€™t understand why people had them at all
was waiting for another school but no aid offer and Iâ€™m losing hope for that school either way
(totally didnâ€™t just think LFG was an acronym for a school. I am so smart)
Holy shit I just realized you kids were born in 2006
I feel so old wtf
anyone able to help me explain why the point 1,2 goes to 2-(3)(1/2)
So effectively we want to walk down a line a distance of 0.5 (from 1 to 0.5). So, we can do y1 + mx = y2, where y1 is our starting point and y2 is where we are going. x=-0.5 cause thatâ€™s how big of a step weâ€™re taking (ans we are doing it backwards) and we need to find m. Luckily, we have an equation dy/dx = 2y-x, so at (1,2), our slope is 4-1 = 3. 

Putting that all together, we get that y2 (estimates y value at 0.5) = 2 (y value at 1) - 0.5*3 (0.5 steps backwards along a slope of 3)
Did you graduate early?
Arenâ€™t you supposed to be like 14😭
I cant find the link to it
If anyone is studying for Calc AB, hereâ€™s this
If studying for Calc BC, hereâ€™s this
Iâ€™m so stressed for bc tmr I just need it to be over 😭😭
I donâ€™t do ap Calc but I feel yâ€™allâ€™s pain bc I have ib bio tomorrow as well
Itâ€™s last years so
Word of advice for physics C (mechanics at least) Those tests are SHORT. If youâ€™re stuck on something, just move to the next question and come back
u went to lville?
did NOT get in my essays were so bad
Are you at a private school rn
no im literally on a 90 percent ride for cwru idk why i wanted to go to boardinhg school
i would have died around the spoiled rich kids 😭 i read for choate rosemary hall at a qb tournie and they were so pretentious n annoying
Idk why that didnâ€™t click lmao
It couldâ€™ve been worse
Certain parts were mad annoying
you can message them through the housing app or find them on social media or whatever if you want to talk before move in
Does the housing application open before room selection normally? If so, how long before?
i was able to access the housing application may 3rd last year and room selection began june 8th and was available every thursday for the following few weeks iirc
I gotta decide between pre med or engineering and I cannot choose to save my life 😭. Anyone willing to help me decide before tmrw? The main problem is I dont really have any passion, but Im pretty decent at math. The cuthroatness and outside time committment for premed makes me not want to do that, but I'm not sure if I would succed or not. I just wish I knew which path would make me happier yk
I'm happy to chat, but I'm neither pre-med or engineering. I would say the big things to consider for being pre-med are that 1. About 7% of pre-med freshmen will actually become doctors. Maybe a little higher considering reapplying to med school, but yeah. And 2. Even if you are in that 7%, you become a doctor after 4 years undergrad, 4 years med school, 3-7 years residency, and then often a fellowship. So you probably aren't making doctor money until you're at least 30. Doctor money is really good though
To be totally honest, if you are not incredibly passionate and committed about becoming a doctor, willing to deal with 8 years of racking up loans and another few years not being able to pay them off, keeping terrible hours, and being asked of challenging tasks, you're probably not going to make it
yeah thats what im worried about. The thing is though both my dad and step.om are in medical field and they dont support me doing anything else. So i dont have any connections in engineering..
You don't need nepotism to succeed in engineering
Don't let someone else pressure you into going into a health field. But also consider that doctor is not the only way to be pre-health. Becoming a pharmacist for example
Thats the other problem i left out. Im deciding between case, uw madison, and a local liberal arts college still 💀
Madison will be around 10k cheaper than both, but cost isnt really an issue. Madison theres 2 different colleges, so pretty hard plus grade deflation for premed. Case easy obv. Liberal arts college doesnt have enginerring or 3+2
If you think you may be interested in engineering and it's not even an option at the liberal arts college, I would say save yourself the headache of a future transfer and choose between Madison and Case
Imo Case is probably the most viable to do either engineering or premed without screwing yourself over for one or the other
Personally I went from engineering to applied math to now being math and geology
One reason why I decided to try out Case was because I knew I could transfer back to my state school if I hated it here, whereas if I went to my state school I'd never get another chance at cwru
Most grad students I know are in math, cs, or engineering
Lmao, flip a coin and if you find yourself disappointed with the result, choose the other
I will say I donâ€™t know anything about UW but itâ€™s really easy to switch majors at case so if u start w/ premed and decide u hate it u can very easily switch to engineering
i will kill you adam
not another one smh my head
And bro already left 😭
Guess it didn't work out
Yeah, it was eh. Mcq's were harder then I though and the part where you have to find the inertia of a disk we weren't taught. But I think I either got a 5 or 4
i ran out of time for the mc
People aren't super non-social, but I think people lean more introverted
I don't think those are mutually exclusive
Like there are people who seem pretty average but then you find out they've spent like $500 on minis for war games or like 3000 hours in csgo
Nope
Man I just dont know if ill vibe woth people at case. Ive lived in a very homogenous community my life. though yall seem to be chill
Eh not really, I don't think most people are pretentious
I have a friend who grew up in a village of like 1000 people and another who had dial up internet until like 3 years ago
I won't say I'm like, super normal, but I'm mostly well adjusted lol. I just really like pokemon and DnD
I mean I don't think Case is all awkward nerds or something
Gotcha. Maybe im overthinking but would people be annoyed if i ended most of my sentences with 'chat'. It's sort of a bad habit
I think campus is pretty diverse and welcoming, but I understand being nervous. College can be scary in any regard
I honestly don't think people care
Buddy there is not a single person I know that doesn't use chat or brother in like every other sentance
But most people don't know me
I was somewhat well known in high school, but it wasn't that big of a school. Probably like 20% of people knew me or knew of me
But yeah idk I think it's not that bad to make friends at Case
I didnt think about that lol
no know like ive watched prestonplayz but i dont have close friends who are asian
Idk about most people, but personally, it was a mix of my roommates and housemates, clubs I joined, classes, and a bunch of chance encounters that formed long term friendships
Bill, you haven't met him, he took this year off
I first met someone from the fraternity I eventually joined because I got lost and he offered me a burger lol
Friends in Glub + evil math class + Theseus gnomes for me
i aint jujin
Damn
u didnt tell me this about case students
Average height in my frat is probably 5â€™9 but I donâ€™t think anyone is within 2 inches of that average. Everyone is either like 6â€™4 or 5â€™5
LMFAO fair
You're probably still taller than my mom
Donâ€™t you have like 3 jobs, surely you need to wake up early for one of them
I did in fact have to wake up early for one of them... truly I am suffering from success
I wish I knew what I should be studying for this
Itâ€™s a placement exam why would you study
Idk nursing only has to take intro to stats
Yeah a friend of mine that's in the nursing program rn told me that we can just fail the math placement bc it doesn't matter
Study (at this point itâ€™d be cramming) â€”> do â€œbetterâ€ â€”> be put in a class that requires information/knowledge that u just crammed into ur noggin and donâ€™t actually conceptualize â€”> be sad
I guess but I'd still prefer to be prepared
Thatâ€™s fair
I haven't had a math class in over a year
So I feel like even if it's information I know I'd still not do great because it's been so long
I did AP calc so I didnâ€™t have to take the placement test. Iâ€™d assume itâ€™s pre calc and basic calc questions?
My school only ever went to precalc so idk
Anything beyond that is stuff I don't know
I canâ€™t imagine theyâ€™d ask anything super niche or formulaic
Yeah per some googling it seems akin to SAT math but with some more trig
It's a math placement exam iirc, basically determines if you're ready for calculus or if you need to take remedial math
If you never took precalc, this test is for you 😭
I never had to take it because I had credit from ap calc
Unfortunately my school doesn't have AP
Poor school :waaah:
If we were allowed to choose our classes I would've chosen a math class but they didn't let us choose so it was all things like public speaking psychology English
It happens, I wouldn't be worried about it. Most people taking math classes at Case start in calc 1
where did u find thisâ€¦?
You can probably sign into canvas but there won't be anything interesting yet
I need to open mine, idk why Iâ€™ve been procrastinating
Lmao profs probably won't have slides ready for a while
My advisor says the only thing that keeps her sane teaching lower level classes is remaking all the course material each semester
Every Thursday starting tomorrow
Guess how often it shows up in your inbox
Like wdym congratulations this isn't a positive award :sideeye:
Thankfully I won't be going into debt because my mom is covering what's left over
You guys can't access the placement exam yet?
I might have to go into some debt starting my junior year though if they pick up my costs since she'll be making more
idk if i was signed up for it?? its not on my canvas
Have you gotten a 5 on an ap calc exam?
If so, you won't take the placement exam
my skl doesnt offer aps
Ah, probably just hasn't showed up then
If you have credit for calculus from any source, you don't need to take the placement exam
Idk if they'd opt you out of a placement exam if you do well enough
I didn't run into that so I don't know personally, but it's possible
do i still need to take any math courses if i got a 5 in bc last year?
@danielicus how does it feel to be done
It seems like it
Fair
so that we don't have to sit through everybody walking across the stage
I guess unless you have a friend in a different school whoâ€™s giving a speech and you want to hear theirs
basically only differences are:
1. my name won't be in the program, it will be in the program next year
2. they hand me an empty envelope instead of one with a diploma in it
doesnâ€™t have the same ring to it when itâ€™s not â€œsophie vcâ€ huh
I know it's very sad
how hard are these designated ones for like gen chem or multivar
i didnâ€™t take any but ik @cawu took the calc 3 one
so i havenâ€™t actually taken any astro classes yet bc those doesnâ€™t start until sophomore year, but ik bill janesh teaches the intro sequence and heâ€™s really nice + iâ€™ve heard great things about his classes
Y'all think I'm gonna need a laptop for my major
IMO MechEs/people using solid works are the only people who benefit significantly from a fast laptop. 

CS just get something well built, reliable and easy to carry. 

My laptop was never the fastest and is over 6 years old now and I am planning to continue to use it until I graduate. 

But I also know multiple people who bought faster but worse built laptops who had things fail after a couple years
But you will absolutely need a laptop of some sort for CS. Depending on what sort of CS you end up doing you could probably get away with a Mac but most courses at Case expect you to have Windows
And then lost the band 💀
I can get honor grad back but I'm pretty sure that pin is gone forever
unless you really want to do a bunch of ml stuff on your laptop just get something midrange that will last a while and have good battery life
u don't even need a gpu
it wasn't bad at all. https://casfaculty.case.edu/christopher-butler/math-proficiency-exams/ has all the info you need (go to policies and then scroll down to the "topics". I can get you the textbooks in question if you want, but they ask you about pretty standard stuff for the class
The placement exam opens today
I think u literally need a 30 to not be in remedial math
so donâ€™t stress too much
Placement exam?
Math
Idk if you log into your email you might see
Hmm I got the daily but nothing about canvas
Ugh
Now I gotta sit down and write another essay
but if they say its a writing seminar, idk i feel like its in the name of the class
i think the idea is that if you have a hard time with it you should do a lower level aiqs? but idk
Some of the links don't work
TBHK MENTIONED 🗣🗣🗣 WTF IS BEING ALIVE
i need to catch up omg
Uhhh idk i think???
nooo they still need to approve my case id photo
I think it takes up to 48 hrs
oh woah okok
I wish you could change photos
mine is actually so bad 😭
fair
the pain tho
I have a really stupid looking haircut in mine
Iâ€™ve been trying to upload an id photo for the past twenty min but it keeps on saying invalid 😭😭
Oh it worked when I did it on my phone
my caseonecard photo was approved but cannot access the housing application tho
probably nothing
i prob wont need more
Housing still hasn't opened
Itâ€™ll probably never open
If your scholarships are higher than tuition you have to pay taxes on that amount even if they are covering room and board.
idk if i reported that to tax
they never give me anything
i got refuned, but lots of those money went into textbook
i still cant see the math placement test on canvasâ€¦
Is it only for people that havenâ€™t taken AP Calc or an equivalent?
Yes. If you have calc credit, you wonâ€™t see the placement test
i tried calling but no answer
For the card still has not been approved
Tbf they donâ€™t work on weekend
Ig but I was hoping it would've been approved yesterday since it all opened Thursday lmao
My placement exam
Oh and the seminar
Fair point
A few hours
I was just hoping the card would be as timely
Cause housing is worrisome
Most of my classes don't technically mandate attendance, but professors are much more likely to be kind or lenient to you if you're struggling if you've been showing up to and trying in class
It greatly depends on the class
But if you have a good excuse, you usually won't be punished
But donâ€™t skip tbh
If you skip one class it can become skipping a whole week of class
And it doesnâ€™t end well
my sister goes to harvard and told me she used to go to lectures 15 hrs a week but now 4 since she watches them online?
damn : (
Just go to class
how many hours a day do you go to class?
Uhh depends on the semester, I've had some very unbalanced schedules. I've had as many as 6 hours in a day, but as few as 1 hour
Average is probably 2-3ish hours per day
Lots more out of class study time vs HS
but idk how dependent iâ€™ll be on harder stuff in college
there are no rules in college
I never use AI, usually I'm able to get a good idea from lecture and textbooks, but often I'll seek examples or methods for specific problems online
I donâ€™t use it at all. I know some people in my matlab course would use ai to ask what was wrong with their code but it isnâ€™t always 100% reliable. In terms of using ai to learn concepts - u should avoid it because ai can give incorrect info.
Bigger lectures might be recorded, but going to class is super important, especially as the classes get smaller and the material gets more difficult. Be there and ask questions. Most* classes do not require attendance, but if you show up to office hours and the professor has never seen you in class in their life, that might not be the best impression

*for large classes. Seminar or discussion style classes often do require attendance
it would be better to just truly learn the concepts yourself rather than rely on ai because come exam season, you only have yourself to rely on :3
that they never got rid of
i skipped the second half of linear algebra and got a 97 on the last exam before the final
i also got an A on the final i just forgot what grade it was
it really just depends on the lecturer
However, as a non-math major (mega cringe), you took MATH 201 (bad linear algebra)
As a math major, Peter | Math '28 will take MATH 307 (good linear algebra), which one cannot skip half of
i did not see the math major
They made me reconsider whether I wanted to do anything other than math
If your required math classes don't make you question your life choices are you even a math major
Itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a math major â˜ºï¸
Iâ€™ve seen some mildly unprofessional stuff on Wiki* but never someone swearing
But I don't think those would be at all applicable to my career so I don't know if they'd be relevant on a resume
I don't plan on being a game dev the work life balance there is godawful
In my experience, math has been so fun here
Granted, I am known for liking math a â€œlittle bitâ€, so the life choices it made me doubt were whether I wanted to do anything other than math
Lol I mean I enjoy majoring in math and I'm passionate about it, but I won't lie and say it's an easy major. It can be brutal and even punishing at times, but it builds character and it strengthens your mathematical maturity
I have like one lab that's really fucking my schedule
I'm taking Werner (but not for the same class unfortunately)
I guess we'll find out how she is together
It's the graduate course for people who took the undergrad ones and thought "I don't hate myself enough already"
Jokes aside it is important for math so if anyone here is thinking of going to math grad school, highly recommend
To elaborate: the two graduate real analysis courses are MATH 423 (measure theory) and MATH 424 (functional analysis). They're both *de facto* undergrad courses for many places, and some recent grad school enjoyers have told me that most people are weakest in analysis, so yes
Mathematicians could never be content to leave rulers alone
I would not be caught dead taking 440 without knowing people in that class 😅
like actually immediately halves the difficulty of the class to be able to ask someone questions
I told you right that Orendain said hi to me and I almost said "hi Juan" back even though I'm the only one that doesn't call him that 😭
Fair
Still can't apply for housing
Left handed behavior
we live in a boring dystopia
i get a macbook loaner for my job every summer and i have to say the battery life isnâ€™t particularly notable
macbook as someone who CADâ€™s actually sucks
battery does not last, and half of the time the documents dont open
The character is a top/middle in the artillery class but heâ€™s outclassed and has short range for being a ranged character
pros battery sucks but air ik is better
running fusion 360 actually sucks
damn, have you tried dual booting
i havent lol
primarily bc its just started causing problems
cuz ive been making bigger files
wtf who
I should have never switched to 11
Handshake sending me emails about internships like I didn't only check I was looking for campus jobs
Reminds me one guy apparently got a $30 cs internship as a SENIOR IN HIGHSCHOOL
Crazy work
i can't even get an internship as a college student smh my head
shake my head my head
anyone in the east coast, how was the rain for yall?
Did some East Coast-wide event happen
the rain lasted like 30 minutes for me
what happened did the east coast discover rain
It got so bad it was just a solid gray on the windshield
oh jeez
we lost power lmao, our skl is disgusting
rip
From Mass but in Maine rn - no rain here
i think it rained in balitmore? i havent been outside since this morning but i saw someone come in with an umbrella
No rain so far in NC but there is some forecasted
oh gotchu
i did 18 credits my first semester. if you take into account my unpolished study habits, occasional late night project grind, frequent gymming, hanging out with friends, gaming, etc, i basically only had the time and motivation for watching 2 hours of anime with japancase per week 💀
if you are piling up on credits early be careful about taking on too many ECs
Depends on the person, personally I mostly have glee club (3 hours per week) and my fraternity + exec board (3 hours a week or so). Then a couple other clubs I'll stop by sometimes that add to an hour or two a week, like math club and a craft circle. And for next semester I've become a part of HvZ Core (the people in charge of making our humans vs zombies game happen), which is another couple hours a week. I'm definitely busier than many of my peers though haha
Cuz I have a lot of things I want to explore but only so much time
I definitely tried out more stuff in my first semester, but I ended up dropping down to a more manageable level
unfortunately my disc got disabled
no seriously i need to figure out what, if any, will even transfer
To which I say no, Iâ€™m a math major AND a CS major
Double or nothing
Growing up excuse for why I want to do cs
I would watch my caretaker build computers and work on motherboards
It's what got me into computer engineering up until I took physics and realized I was not made for doing that for 4 years
For my whole life I have always been a math person
once upon a time in junior year my friend was like "you should try learning python" and well i haven't lost interest in coding so here i am
Idk if anyone knows but I am very curious why a aed works when you put the pads on the upper right side and lower left
the reason why aeds are used for cardiac arrests etc is often to reset the heart's electric rhythm to normal. the pads send an electric shock from one pad to another. the reason why it is put on the upper right and lower left of the heart is to create a path of electrical current that will make contact with the heart.
AAAAAAAAA i still have fucking school until june 9 kill me now 😭
Not that college isn't better (it is) but make memories now with the people from high school
Ooo my graduations the 9th I done end until the 6th tho 😭
My head hurts
Certainly not miss about south Carolina
They had us outside in 90+ degree weather for an hour and a half I have a migraine
Oooh that sucks I hope ur migraine goes away soon
Also you will miss the heat once you experience midwest winter
apparently i got put into some ranked typeracer lobby
cause what
cant be that much different
In 8th grade we had a computer class
in 6th grade in my technology class my teacher was stunned "how did you type 73 wpm" [when everyone else is much worse]

and i deadass told her that its because i played a lot of minecraft uhc
Gaming means you have to type fast so you can curse someone out before the round ends
My friend is such a bad typer her record is 28 wpm 💀💀
Tbh that's not even that bad
Damn really? I thought itâ€™d be at least 70-80
lmfao i have the worst typing method
Nope, that's actually extremely fast
what in the name of fuck
so i don't blow out my wrists by 35
I've not bothered with touch typing though
I type fast enough without it and it would probably take me years of focused study to learn
Ain't nobody got time for that
you mean touch typing as in thping without looking at the keyboard?
is this how you type your essays the night before theyre due for premed? 🤣
idk how yall type so fast, im like a grandma on the keyboard
my speed is pretty slow
Being able to do this without looking
this is vaguely how I type (120-130 or so wpm), but i don't use Rshift which ik you're supposed to for touch typing
I've never heard it described as home row typing lol
I had to learn how to type like that for a stupid class in middle school and itâ€™s just stuck
i use homerow but theres plenty of people faster than me that dont use homerow
but keyboard layouts don't make much of a difference
oh that
typing steno in every day work sounds insane
They make a difference but qwerty is so ingrained that you have to spend longer training muscle memory on a new one
One thing I've been told is a bit weird is that I can type without looking at my phone lol
they really dont tho
But yeah I do not home row type I use approx 7 fingers (don't use pinkies or left ring finger)
I like home row cause i can shift to WASD really easily lmfao
The general consensus seems to be that layouts like Dvorak and Colemak are a bit more efficient (perhaps 5%), but not to an extreme extent
i wouldn't call that a difference tho
You can say you don't think it matters, but it is a difference
But most people don't type enough for it to be life changing
And most people don't even have a need to type faster than 40 or 50
Being able to type is useful, but you get a lot of diminishing returns
Largely because I think that how fast you think is a more serious constraint when it comes to getting information down on a page
i do like typing fast tho
I think I would struggle to employ my pinkies though
my left pinky (pinkie?) is only usable because i play videogames where i crouch a lot
I didn't really grow up playing very many wasd video games
that's fair. I started wasd games in maybe 6th grade(?) but still have crouch bound to shift because i have tiny hands
ppl from my school don't leave the state usually
ppl from my school don't care about college usually
Late to the typing speed discussion
left: one lobe one helix
right: two lobes
Ik someone that is in the class above me and someone in the class below me
As the days pass I get closer to having to do that math test
stats teacher made some stupid project
wouldnt this pose a bias though, considering the levels of shelly and jessie(just a thought)
I really do enjoy it here, but the main gripe I have is that to a lot of people, this was their second choice. That's totally fine, you can't *make* a school be your first choice, but many people here let that affect them wayyyyy past the time of college admissions when it actually matters. Sometimes I see people wearing more merch from other colleges than from Case, and it makes me sad.
Because Case is a good school. And no, that's not a generic platitude, Case genuinely is a good school and offers lots of opportunities. Sure, there are other schools which have a higher position in some arbitrary ranking or have a better name or one of their numbers is higher than Case's, but what matters is how much *you* enjoy this school and how much you get out of your time here, and you will have a shitty experience if you spend your entire time thinking "what if" or feeling bad about going here.
I'm sure all of you have heard a hundred times over that Case is good and you should be happy you got in here, but also it is largely up to you how happy you feel here. You can choose to throw yourself into things and have a nice time at this school, or you can choose not to and always wish you were somewhere else and probably end up quantitatively worse for it after you graduate. And plus, if you think Case is bad, tell that to the people who got rejected or waitlisted here and would love to be in your shoes right now.
Please, new freshmen, feeling bad about how college admissions went really is okay. But that's for the college admissions season -- not for your entire college experience. So throw yourself into activities and classes and research, make friends here and have fun, because your college experience is what you make of it. And if CWRU is your second choice *now*, it probably won't be by the end of your freshman year.
i feel rly lucky in terms of opportunities for my major
feel like this is esp tru for any life science major
Case wasn't even like
A seriously considered option
I wasn't expecting to get in one 😭
There was no point in applying to schools I couldn't afford
Even my state school was borderline unaffordable for me so
Thats so real, i looked at the acceptance rate and said eh i need another reach school
also lowkey i feel like schools dont matter
Also for you freshmen who aren't so excited about Case right now, that really is okay, but please do not get stuck on that mindset your entire time here or it won't be fun
ima just put my two cents in bc this topic is of importance to me :3 it is always a bit disheartening when you see people on campus walking around with other college's merch because case chose you and you chose case, that is something that a person should be thankful for rather than resentful or aggrieved over
there's a fair share of people who will constantly joke about transferring and ditching cleveland because "it's case, it's full of Ivy rejects. it's Ohio, it's trash". if you decide to come to a school to constantly complain, (in my opinion) it's ungrateful. it's ungrateful to your parents, it's ungrateful to case, it's ungrateful to the other students who would kill to be in your place, and it's ungrateful to yourself and your achievements that got you there.
this is not just a college-specific situation; in real life, you will need to live life and learn to make the best of your situation, not constantly whine about it or you can never be happy, even if it's not your most perfect, ideal plan. and if you can't find the willpower to make lemonade out of lemons or wtv, there's no need to make those around you feel guilty *cough cough*
case is an incredible school, moreso for those who can see beyond other peoples' sentiment. prestige means nothing in the long run if you similarly can't make anything out of a suboptimal situation. i may be biased, but case has given me opportunities i know for certain i would not have found at other "more prestigious" schools that i rejected; i actually feel like i've been seen. i would not have found a mentor so willing to take on a undergrad freshman, i would not have found myself in a program as beneficial for my future goals and aspirations, i would not have found these incredible one-of-a-kind people i've gotten to know over my first year <3 ily guys
to all the incoming freshman, congratulations on getting in! you guys all worked so hard
if you're under the impression that the college application f-ed you over, please don't get too caught up in this 'prestige career' trap; things will all work out in the end
OH.
The people at the admissions office are people too
"Some colleges allow late admissions deadlines, some just a few weeks prior to a semester starting." 🙏
I've never heard of this book ngl
Study for what
You mean the Putnam exam right
The hard math one?
i almost qualified for the aimey so im pretty dec at math
So if you want we can chat about it
thats sick, did u get more than 1 point?
wtf
i mean u can def make that then but quant is money no? dont most math people sucvumb to finance
And hey, if things don't work out like you said, I can probably get employed *somehow*
i mean ur basically ascendant irl in math so do it bruh
but yeah imma study all summer and tryna get a 2
what did u study with
I didn't 🤡
I was trying to organize a math circle for it but it didn't work out
Hopefully it will work out this semester though
wtf? so u just mogged out of nowhere?
Apparently
I doubt it's most. And money isn't everything lol
i strive to be like adam, but if i get to ur skill level im doing quant sorry bud
I mean do what you wish
And it can't hurt that it makes bank lol
I prefer my math completely useless tyvm
in case quant dont work out
How much computer work is there in quant
Nah the philosophy mines are where it's at for money
I think money likes me but I prefer to do hard puzzles like quant
If quant and premed dont work ill do engineering prawlly
then if that doesnt work maybe ISNY
You may be disappointed to learn that quant requires quite a bit of programming/cs knowledge lol
the reddit post for quant i looked at didnt mention cs??
Well you need to know things like algorithms and c++ or another programming language
I mean I'm a math guy not really cs but some programming understanding was still needed for an intro to numerical analysis
I'm just saying that if you hate computers, quant is not a field to avoid them
I just cant stand the ones that flicker with the hp
And how to find an integral in the complex plane
But I don't have the same "Putnam" type of skill some other people do
Ah how I wish we had the LaTeX bot in here
Isnt that bleak though? Basically saying if ur career isnt well, u diddnt try going for enough?
oh. So the logic isnt flawed, but the original statement? Clever
I do own this server so I *could* add the LaTeX bot but I'd rather not be annoying to everyone else
God I hate math
Wrong opinion
Yet you major in philosophy
You have "Math" in your name (sequentially)
I've never been a huge sports person so case being d3 doesn't really matter although considering how many schools I applied to were d1 it was actually kind of surprising
Tbh in two years I've never gone to a CWRU sports match
I generally am not that into watching sports tho
Really hoping I get into gender inclusive housing
none of my floormates aside from roommate ended up being among my main friends so dont get discouraged if you dont get in
what happens if you dont get in
even housing aside, college is practically engineered for us to make friends with each other (to a far greater degree than k-12)
into gender inclusive housing? idk ig you get another housing assignment instead
they take away your pronouns :(
do they put you with someone who also didn't get in or is it just random
I use all of them but I can't like
So I just went w he/him
It would be fitting to get into GIH I didn't spend 3 years in the GSA for nothing 💪
😭 id love to do gih but I dont wanna be in Clark bc of all the floors also parents yk
yeah i thouyght they said it wasn't in clarke
Oh I didn't know that lol it's fine tho gih isn't high on my list of needs also I already know what dorm I want so it's not bad
idk anything ab the dorms
in general shoot for anything that isnt clarke
Does anyone know how well credits transfer? I am going premed with possible math minor. I have taken calc bc, calc 3, and diff eq in high school and want to see if it transfers. Ive also taken 12 ap exams
there is a part of the site for the scores you need to get credit from ap exams
if your college courses counted towards high school credit typically they will not be counted
why is clarke so bad?
Not all 40 floors get used I think but still
What gets me is that it has 1 flight of stairs for the whole building, so if there's a fire ...
ONE FLIGHT OF STAIRS SERIOUSLY
I remember my friend who lived in taplin didn't have a fire door for their dorm
bad fire in a dorm is
I canâ€™t remember though
Calc BC transfers iff you got a 5 on the AP exam
Still don't love the 3:1 floor-to-stair ratio compared to Mistletoe
Also if you live in Clarke the elevators are likely to break on move in day . . . And even if they don't, there's two elevators for 300 people or so
the reason why im suffering in hs rn is mostly due to how i think
If you constantly do things that make you miserable your environment won't matter
I've seen lake Erie a couple times, haven't spent a bunch of time there. It's not really well suited for swimming or anything lol
Idk, maybe some people do, I've never been particularly inclined to it personally
maybe i havenâ€™t been to the right part of the lake but there isnâ€™t much waterfront in my experience
Edgewater Beach is moderately close to Case and very pleasant. My boyfriend and I biked there a lot last summer 

I also really like the lake front nature preserve which is a very short bike ride from case
Oh swag
they went to my hs
4 year apparently
I have never talked to mine. Would recommend talking to your premajor one though once you get them
i went through mine to coordinate the class im taking at a local school in baltimore this summer--it had to be okayed by the math dept and stuff but she was my first point of contact for the paperwork etc
I talked to one but it wasnâ€™t mine it was just a random other one
I have yet to use ratemyprof
for example the freshman physics lab coordinator gets terrible ratings (as she should) from everyone who just had her as lab director in the standard calc-based physics, but premed ppl who have her in alg based physics love her. or my friend and i both took phil 101 in the fall, and my prof had good ratings across the board, and his prof's were mostly really bad, but it turns out all the stem majors thinking phil would be an easy breadth loved my prof and hated his, and i actually wanted to do philosophy and had an awful time in my class whereas my friend loved his class
so it can be deceptive but its a useful tool still
I have had accurate experiences with rate my professor. There was one bio professor who I took that had bad reviews and I ABSOLUTELY hated the man (avoid Bader at all costs especially if you have testing accommodations) and I have very much liked my professors who have had positive reviews. However, it is not 100% accurate (philosophy 101 prof is a good example of that - he has awful reviews but as @cygnusxxii said I know a friend who absolutely loves the man). Id say if there is a prof who has awful reviews then you should at least ask someone who has had them for their opinion but you shouldn't completely rule out taking a course with said prof.
He hasnt replied to the ones from this spring semester yet but im gonna have to check back when he does
But fr though I kinda dislike this because it might make students feel afraid to be honest
It's anonymous posting after taking a class
Unless he can guess who you are, or you don't want to see his feedback, etc etc etc
Many restaurant owners do that tho
Honestly i didnt know until now that professors could respond to the reviews, i never saw any responses when i checked out profs for taking classes at cleveland state, but it makes sense they can and yeah i think its good
It's not like it personally penalizes you or your grade if you leave a mixed or negative review
I think people are too used to the veil of anonymity protecting them and being able to say whatever they want tbh
Damn
"You need to read a lot of materials" for a 300-level class: really
lowkey want to audit some of the higher level phil classes bc apparently stuff like ethics and ancient phil are the weed out classes for phil majors at case (youd think the major is too small for weeding but i digress) and i feel like itd stress me out a ton to have the pressure of grading in a 300 level phil class but i would absolutely love to take ancient phil
hos easy is it to study abroad
this reminds me of the review that called ronald loui "the diogenes of computer science"
if we just have two ppl taking turns it should be doable tho
Yeah I just hope they don't get back to me with like
Apparently if you call it can be a lot quicker
I remember back in my freshman year when everybody had to do a spit test for covid first thing after getting on campus, and our samples got fucking stolen
I hope my spit sold well
But I didn't call or anything
whoops! didnt mean to steal this, have it back
really weird
i took it last semester
Uh oh!
was not super intelligent of me, still got an A tho
while trying to get a racecar together and not fail semiconductor physics
I don't know how i am still sane
whatever you want to put in. We have some people that just show up and make parts and some people that spend upwards of 40 hours a week on it.
oh and we have 3d printed metal
Y'all think I should go math 121 or 125
(assuming I don't fail my placement exam 💀💀)
depends on whether you want a BA or BS
ive heard math 125 is really janky? like parts of it are more discrete math than calc?
On the path it says I can basically choose either
So I just want to choose the least bad poison
You forgot to mention squircles, 'cause we have those too! Mating those googly eyes to a squircular surface was far more difficult that is should have been. All worth it though!
Also you're AE and I think AE doesn't have the distinction, only BSE
if you're an engineer you don't get to choose between the two though. you only get to do BSE
lol, is it just the ampunt of math?
So in the case of CS it is the amount of math but it's not just that
like the math BS has more physics/gen science requirements
completely seperate note it's insane that neither CS major needs to take diff eq
Other separate note it's insane that neither CS major needs to take 307
idt anyone except for hardcore math people really *need* more theoretical lin alg
you don't need 307 for physics
For quantum mechanics you def need the stuff with complex numbers that they don't do in 201
Yeah but why are you studying physics of all things if your goal is to get through it without understanding what's going on
idk man I'm an electrical engineer
i still need to see if aero is for me
ben doesn't write software for us
will and ben are friends though
well how else are you supposed to simulate dynamics
But still
if you want to develop a physics model for a rubber belt transmitting 10HP through a CVT hit us up
Top 3 physics math: "linear algebra", "integrals", """""""theorems"""""""
Top 3 EE math: integrals, Laplace transforms, **j**
Top 3 CS math: proof by induction, n log n, logical or
advanced EE math is just real analysis
Sorry I just have to ask
rigorous enough to work in real life presumably
isn't fourier complex analysis or am i head empty
Head empty
my bad
pde scary
Why is math bot not working???
yo TeX bad
It doesn't seem to work even with valid LaTeX
yeah just tried inline, block and no things
Reminds me of a freshman physics professor at Case:
"Are there any math majors in the room?"
*silence*
"Anyway ..." proceeding to cancel out a dx in a numerator and a denominator
I hereby announce that through thorough testing on other servers, MathBot appears to just be globally broken
The lowest grade I've gotten at this school was from my diff eq professor because that class  **S U C K E D**
havent heard much about them
i took calc 3 last sem and had kind of a rough time but we also got a new prof a couple weeks into the semester and by his own admission he didnt want to be there 💀 and even given that there were people who had a good experience in the class
Thatâ€™s fair
She's dead now
Passed away beginning of last semester
oh shit
I guess she reached her limit
May she rest in peace but she didn't seem to care about the class at all
Has anyone here taken the placement exam
For math
so if I had two CCP english credits out of the 4 needed for HS, they donâ€™t count unless it was a surplus?
too late to make a l'hospital joke I guess
you could probably find more by asking a past 223 student for their practice finals
Decide whether we get put in remedial math or not
You know what else is free? The squirrels on campus. Eric Kaler doesnâ€™t want you to know this
Damn
No ferrets though
I need more steel
Also how was the math placement exam for incoming students? Do you need to record yourself doing it or sum?
Never make decisions without knowing all sides
general life advice but don't insure what you *can* afford to lose. careful with your phone and very unlikely to break the screen? don't buy applecare and just eat the cost of the screen if you do break it. insurance is weird.
and seeing that it's the insurance sector they're almost never gonna not perform well
oh yeah well life insurance is insuring something you can't afford to lose
this is typically for the elderly or people of at least parent status cause who tf else getting your death benefits
I'd lock that shit in if I were you
Idk bout you but I have my r6 account insured
i dont even own a crossbow
Your senior class folks
I bet you don't even have volcano insurance, sucker
About to do my placement exam
100% getting put into remedial math but oh well
It's been like a year and a half since I've touched anything math related 💀
Remedial math shouldn't be all bad. I'm looking forward to it.
Intentionally to an extent because I didn't answer half of the questions but
I definitely am going to need it because even though I recognized all those concepts it's been so long since I actually did them they may as well be foreign to me
not the socal hate!
If anyone tells me I'm from California and that's bad, I remind them that they're living in Ohio
thats so fair
going to miss the coast 😦
I am not from the coast so I am blessed in not having anything to miss
On the whole, Ohio weather is more stable during a single day but less stable over a week than California
yeah LA never changes
i've never owned a coat in my life
You've never gone into the mountains???
Aren't they like right there
Honestly in my experience as a sunny state individual, sure Ohio is cold but it isn't *that* cold so you don't need like an Arctic-level coat
(This is really my fault, in turning Ohio into California)
particularly weather wise
I lived there for a little bit but ~~luckily~~ not anymore
i did a program at berkeley end of june and i couldnt see the sun for two days
now berekeley is arguably the worst place u can be
You mean where they drag race cars because the police are too busy with much more serious crimes to do anything about it?
I wish I were kidding but yaeh I do know
See I omoved away from the Bay when I was 5 so I do not recall much of this
i like the car meets they have sometimes in oakland
Where in the bay are you from? (Unless you don't want to dox yourself which is fine)
close to walnut creek
What are you doing with the computer?
mostly schoolwork but ill have to work w rendering and solidworks and everything
i was hoping to hear that
If you want gross details, cpubenchmark.net is the site I use
if you're really worried about simulation or rendering we do have a supercomputer 🤷
ah thats okay i just need one bc i have a 6 year old mac and it's breaking rn so i just need to get a new one anyway
oh its a solid propellant so it's a chemical fuel rather than a typical motor
first attempt used erythritol instead but the burn was too slow for the weight of the rocket
never ended up actually flying it because I had to graduate high school and then worked the following summer
aw man that's so sad
the rocket team at case does a good amount of HPR but they unfortunately don't do propulsion development. I believe they've had a tough time getting the okay from the school to mix propellants
at least think[box] wants very little to do with it. they aren't even allowed to store propellant on campus I don't believe
esp w everything going on in think[box] it's a bad idea to store combustibles like that
I WANT TO
mad support on that one
car go brrrr student organization
It last snowed in my hometown in 2009 🙂
I mean this year was actually more than a few before it but yeah still less than when i was younger and weâ€™d see close to a foot of snow several times per year
last in my hometown in 1949
Jesus the website in 2002 looked awful
Thatâ€™s even worse more random ppl
I'm disappointed that archive.org never grabbed most of the sub pages including the tuition one. I wanted to see what the tuition was in 2002
Damn my scholarship money is worth more than that 💀
Google college inflation to find out more!
I got shin splints in high school and they still get mad at me occasionally lol
But it helps a lot when my shins hurt
My fraternity has a service requirement so we record them pretty accurately and iirc the premed brother we have gets like 40-50 or more hours per semester
don't do drugs ~~alone~~ kids
oh also don't snort anything
Also, don't admit to any illegal activity on this server (that includes underage drinking) I don't personally care what you do, but it's healthier for the server if we do not discuss any claims of commission of crimes
I'm 20, but I've tried drinking in countries where the age is 18
alright i'm off to go manufacture firearms and sell them without serial numbers
Because that could totally happen
It won't
or dont mix 😭
I mean, I still don't care one or another personally. But it's better for the server if under 21s don't talk about their drinking experiences besides in theoretical scenarios ofc
don't mix types of alcohol ah
Save heroin for when you really need it
i thought he meant don't mix heroin with other stuff
the good news is whoever you got the h from probably already did that. the bad news is whoever you got the h from probably already did that. so kids just don't do heroin
definitely don't fw fent
He could've been lying tho
plausible scenario tho
i had it for surgery last summer
Case premed students usually have at least one dedicated org that they volunteer with 2-3 hours a week. Most don't get clinical until 2-3rd year. Research usually starts in spring/summer freshman or early sophmore year, non-clinical volunteering can be started immediately. 

Also as someone who did not start early, who did not start making future plans, I would kill a non-zero amount of patients (kidding, not kidding, just kidding) to go back in time to make myself get started on this track earlier.
Can't emphasize this enough. It's a bad time.
I once (very stupidly) drank in the Taft common room summer of freshman year (don't drink underage kids) and got caught by the clarke hall RA that for some reason decided to go to Taft in the middle of the night
wrote me up and I had to meet with someone from office of student conduct and do a training module
reported to the office of student conduct
Wait I didnâ€™t get a math placement anywhere
But I havenâ€™t submitted any scores yet
If your sat math score is over 740 its waived as well
Oh neat
It's been 2 years since I touched a math class
why does it still say ppsp tho i was rejected
ur not rejected anymore
Omg mine also says that and I was also rejected
its an 8-year bs-md program, which basically means that you have automatic acceptance into case's medical school without needing to take the mcat
there's around 10 in my year including me plus i think 3 or 4 dental school students
you still need to take all the pre-med requirements, maintain a 3.73 gpa, volunteer/shadow, do extracurriculars etc. and submit an application to the school, but you're in
there's monthly meetings once a month going over expectations/opportunities; just recently i was at a meeting discussing funding for research :D which was very helpful, granted all these are available to other students as well
biggest plus of the program is that it takes significant stress off of you, because you dont need to worry about studying for mcat or maintain a perfect 4.0
Since to employers it seems to have little to no difference
wait you have to take all the premed reqs for ppsp? my friend rachel is in it and iirc she told me she doesnt have to take a math or anything bc ppsp requires different stuff
ig there isnt the math 125 requirement :0
Well you need 1 extra math class I think
Well you need 17 hours of math courses
MATH 121, MATH 122, MATH 223, MATH 307, MATH 304, MATH 380
oh this isnt questions
I think that one is a humanities scholarship? I don't know the exact details
If you didn't apply for them, it's probably the former
Does LaTeX bot work yet?
how could breaking up with someone be so refreshing wtf
Ending a bad relationship is a good thing
Don't date people you find boring lol
I also cannot emphasize this enough. It's a bad time.
I am. What do u want to know?
I do know that to take a bow on a plane you must unstring them
It's pretty good. Very casual-- plenty of people go to competition, but there is only coaching 1 day a week and it's invite only. I don't know the details of that. Equipment is good for barebow recurve, but idk how much they have for other stuff. It's indoor and a 20m range, and they allow people to store stuff as long as the club's in session. https://discord.gg/s3Bmrgv3 is the best place to ask any questions about more specific stuff. Sorry I can't be more helpful :(
I don't know if I should do the whole roommate finding shtick or just run with whoever cwru gives me
i've heard awkward situations where people straight up don't talk to the other roommate
Wishing you luck 🫡
hopping in to corroborate this take... adam is a plant by the dirty liberal state of California (/j if that isn't abundantly clear)
6-8 hours OUTSIDE of class time a day on this
Which just seems so unrealistic
I choose my roommate which went very well but that was because we met at accepted students day and really hit it off. In addition we called and had a conversation before committing to make sure we had the same desires in a roommate. I do know people who chose and had bad experiences tho. My understanding of that situation was they didnâ€™t really have a convo before committing to be roommates. My advice is I know random has worked well for people. If you want to choose tho have a conversation with your potential roomie before committing!
See im assuming she said that because she thinks we've never seen math before and not because the course is that hard😭😭
@joshuatheeagle you still have those mini fridges you were talking about a month ago?
My mom bought it when I went to a college summer program last year
Even though I thought it was a waste cause how am I gonna fit an entire fridge into a 2 person dorm room
I don't mind having my own tbh cause
thatâ€™s valid. iâ€™d just also consider that since kettles arenâ€™t technically allowed, microwaves def arenâ€™t, and thatâ€™s a lot harder for an ra to overlook if they do a room inspection
Oh that'd be unfortunate
same i feel like i should find someone rather than get assigned someone random but idk how ;-;
I canâ€™t guarantee anything but Iâ€™ll put you on the list
Oh richt
That's due tomorrow right
i thought it was due the 3rd
After you write it itâ€™s self evaluation tho
My advice is to simp for caa to cover the last bit of money
CAA has a lot of money they want to give out every year for scholarships
I think you might need to be stem or stem adjacent to be eligible tho
Cause I'm doing a BA
I wouldn't care as much about the 3k if they didn't *say* they meet full need like that's disingenuous to me to say you meet full need and then base it off of your own calculations of need and not the fafsas 😭
I mean . . . What else are they supposed to do? They also offer full need for international students who don't fill out FAFSA, so it's more equitable to use their own calculations for everyone. They also just weight some things differently vs FAFSA
Idk it hasn't seemed like a distinction to me but maybe some fine print exists somewhere
Hm 👀 maybe I should change my math major back to a BS
how hard is it to get a caa scholarship?
im hoping to not even need it by the time im a junior but it would obviously help anyway
my moms actually not going to be getting that job upgrade until she graduates next year so hopefully they wont mess with my fin-aid until my senior year if at all
oh duh
like to get onto the quad from mlk without going in some weird back entrance
missed my advisor meeting
Apparently her next person is also late so we're still going for now 😭
Damn, what a day for her
Well at least you arenâ€™t alone
Still going
I think her next person isn't coming
what is the seminar thing due today?
It's due tmrw
Imo, not really
There's also local taco on portable swipes that is decent, but not really authentic Mexican food
Tacologist I can not personally speak to, but it doesn't seem like they're really making authentic food
Phusion Cafe goes hard as a taiwanese restaurant
Asia town is on the bus line I think, but it's kind of a journey and I never find myself with the time and energy to go
There's a shuttle that goes there sometimes, or so I've heard
I mean it depends on how often I'm actually able to get to the cafeteria food idk how lines and stuff are there
The lines are bad during o-week
U can take a shuttle to get to cilantro taqueria which imo is reaaally good (itâ€™s like an actual taqueria too at least to my northeast tastebuds). I havenâ€™t actually been there tho I just DoorDash it on the nights where I have a hard night of studying ahead of me and I need a pick me up
After the first week of class the cafeteria is not that hard to get into
Yeah that is fair - but hey I havenâ€™t been out west but I am a huge fan of Mexican/latin American food (my mom literally got me 5 burritos from different Boston places for my birthday one year) so I think I am at least a decent judge of good Mexican food.
I'm gonna have the work study money, the $30 ish dollars my mom sends me a week, and the unlimited plan
I grew up on school food and fast food so I think a place has to be *notably* bad for me to genuinely dislike it
Yeah ik sry that didnâ€™t come across in my message
The dining hall food isn't terrible, it was just rough for me with all my stomach problems
Dining hall food is good itâ€™s just repetitive so u get sick of it
Just ended up getting pizza over and over again 😭
Clemson claflin and another school in south Carolina
If case food isn't like highschool cafeteria bad then I'll be fine 😭
Idk 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
I remember trying my state schools dining hall though and it was supremely ass
I've never had my state schools food
Idk how UofSC is w food
I don't really know how much else I'd even have to spend money on besides food tbh but
Work study jobs don't pay a lot
And hours aren't high
But I do have a pretty hard time getting work hours
Does anybody know the textbook used in Dr. Irene Lee's Class?
isnt it like 2 or 3 am in Ohio
Just chilling too I just got started with the creating an email process my browser is slow tho
oh
How many people are donating to this damn building
I would be surprised if they didn't overrun the cost
I probably won't tbh unless I need to
It doesn't mention that
Idk if by 500 word they mean 500 word minimum and I can go over or they mean they would prefer I don't go over 500 words
prob doesnt rly matter as long as u show u can analyze
I went for 579
Please I'm completing all of mine like a few hours before they are due😭😭
i left the placement test and the seminar to last minute
cause i didnt feel like doing work
Same but I'm doing almost everything last minute
gah damn
I don't remember doing allat back in my days
Though idk if I'm filling that out
They sent an email for people interested in GIH and said if we want to do gih then not to do the housing app
Idk if that means I got accepted into it or😭
honestly didnt feel like i needed to add more
I think it's dealt with separately, and if you don't get into gih you probably just get thrown into the ether or something
How does one get waitlisted by housing wtf
"we don't know if we have the space we promised we had by accepting you"
A lot of colleges accept based on classes and don't consider housing
I know someone who got off waitlist for UCI and can't get housing
I hope I get housing my last 2 years :skullCook:
Even if I get that cs internship or co op money paying for my home as a student would be kinda crazy
Unsure about triangle, because it's gone through periods of being cwru housing and not being cwru housing
Yeah idk how many people actually get screwed in the upperclassmen lottery since many people want to live off campus, but ngl one of the reasons I joined Greek life was for guaranteed housing 😭 I have lots of other reasons ofc but I'm glad to avoid the lottery
Idk anything about frats or Greek stuff
Oh I'm not trying to say you should join Greek life necessarily lol, just that I was also worried about housing
theyre all still upperclassman right? barring like 4 sophomore suites in stj and the triangle lease reverting this year
Greek life has been a financial positive for me, but that's not the case for everyone. It's also because of my specific financial aid setup where I would lose money if I lived off campus
There were a decent amount of sophomores living in stj this and last year at least
They might be trying to revert it to upperclassmen housing tho
The maximum they're allowed to give apparently
I would say that most people I know who want to live on campus have been able to live on campus
However, the lottery means you don't necessarily get your first choice in lodging
Eg. End up in the village when you wanted stj
They just don't give you any non-scam options
I mean, they've wanted to close down Clarke tower for probably over a decade
But they can't stop accepting bigger classes of students
They can't close these buildings down until they have other places for people to live
I know sigma psi lost their house, but who else?
Damn, aren't there quite a lot of them too?
except for my starvemaxxing friends that sometimes have food in their dorm
I don't like coffee
I won't be one of those coffee addicted college students
dawg idc if i get kidney stones or heaet palps i just wanna feel alive for once 😭
Oh and you save MONEYS
I once drank like 2 panera charged lemonades in 1 sitting and nothing happened 🫠
then oh no the sleepy
ok that shi is loaded tho how did u feel nothing 😭
It no longer exists cuz of a lawsuit or something
you wouldnt touch caffeine anymore
too *warm* it makes me feel sick
At least I didnâ€™t spit the hot chocolate out on someone
NO COMPUTER BROKEN!
NO COMPUTER BROKEN 😄
I also noticed I said both I was four-years-old and six years old at the same time so I do not know what age I was exactly when that happened
Have you ever gone back to visit?
Scammed out of the experience damn
Early bird 🦆
my memorys weird tho
bc i remember stuff that happened when i was like 3 or 4
but i depersonalized so badly that i dont remember spring sem of sophomore year and fall sem of junior year
With my cc if you withdraw it still counts against your gpa cause it counts as a fail or something
they were telling us that yeah if we withdrew it still counted against our gpa
that sucks
is choosing classes supposed to be this hard?
i got like 15 min in between two classes for three days which is kind of a pain
Im still on hold
i guess, idek how i got here
Idk it just says I'm on hold still
I've done everything though
Guess it's just on them
i still need to put my vacc info
i spilled dr pepper on my keyboard so im typing without keys 🧍â€â™‚ï¸
Isn't that not required
I just didn't do it
I don't have my vaccination card or anything
Your hold off without you meeting your advisor
Your advisor is the one who's supposed to take the hold off 😭
ohh yeahh, im still on hold lmfao but im just choosing my classes
i think you can access the shopping card while on hold, you just cant register, ans you wont be able to until july ish iirc anyway
i had 3 classes with 15 minutes between each 3 days a week this past semester, and the first two were difficult and i didnt like them, so i was always out of it by the third class. in the fall, though, i had 2 classes with 15 minutes in between which was totally fine except it was hard sometimes to get to the second class on time bc they were kind of far away
bc i cant find aiqs 100
You don't manually ad the seminar
there was another math122 at 9:30 but the only way i could get all those classes in one semester is if i fit them back to back to back like that lmao
2 classes back to back is not the worst thing in the world
but i definitely was worse at paying attention in chem
chem was terrible but cs after long lunch break was fine
Only (major) down side is you can have classes your advisors approve of for electives/count towards your major/minor that the website wonâ€™t recognize
it says i have to do an open elective, does it mean its required?
cuz you can drop classes with no consequence with freshman forgiveness
and ur prob gonna invest more time into extracurriculars later on, which means you don't want to be as busy with academics if possible
i did 18 credits my first semester, it was manageable for the most part if you ignore the occasional late nights for cs projects, but i didnt really do any extracurricular aside from watching 2 hours of anime with japancase club
im planning on doing 17, idk what i should do for a breadth
only one class but i have math 121 at the same time
theres legit only one math 121 and one chem111 class
only one math121 is insane
though lab/recitation/discussion are often said interchangeably
because there dont seem to be many options
you don't have to take a language class for breadth, unless you actually like/wanna learn, taking intro religion classes are the easiest in my experience
What happened to Oscar (Art History '25)
i couldnt believe that there was at least 1 case student in art history
i do wanna learn 😭 , there dont seem to be many options however
idk what to do
you do have 4 years so you don't have to rush it
If you want another class, may I suggest PHYS 121
not enrolling yet just adding to cart and viewing
Thereâ€™s also only one math122 and itâ€™s at 8:25, really hoping they accept my transfer credit so I donâ€™t have to do that
The math department offers the ability to test out of Calc 1-3 and diff eq
So if they donâ€™t accept your credit then just place out
Yeah but if case doesnâ€™t take any of my credits Iâ€™d be testing out of calc 1 and into calc 2
I would be highly surprised if this is something you couldnâ€™t solve with an email
Alex just wondering, do you have AP CS A credit
honestly if you can adapt to that schedule, 8 am classes aren't bad at all
no seriously walking out of your dorm to morning class is such a vibe when no one is outside yet
I can adapt to it if I have to, I just don't want to start my first semester of college annoyed because I'm waking up for an 8am class, 2nd semester and onwards? sure why not
cause 22 creds is the threshold and freshman seminar and math are 4 creds
how many credit hours would this be?
this was my class list last seemster and it was the most depressing and mundane 4 months of my life
This is a rlly stupid question but do breadth requirements also have â€˜creditsâ€™ ?
They may be breadths for you but they're not for someone else
if they didn't it'd take you 8 years to graduate 😭
oh slay
front loading > even spread > end loading
yea but first semester freshman year is 19 max since you dont have a gpa yet
I also had Calc III from HS but I could not transfer it and didn't think to test out
Oh well I guess
I'm going to try, it's just annoying that if i do the calc 3 test I don't get calc 1 & 2 credit as well
Again, I think you should email Chris Butler (math department goat) because he has probably seen this all before
they took my calc 3 from Columbus State CC, and I got calc 1 from AP. They didn't take my CC+ calc 2 cause I took it at my high school during covid
One of my friends ( @quinsential ) wanted to do this and his mean advisor said no
But don't let that stop you
I mean if you have calc credit then you have several options:
MATH 224 (Differential Equations)
MATH 307 (Linear Algebra)
MATH 308 (Abstract Algebra)
MATH 321 (Real Analysis)
iâ€™m also relatively confident i would have been able to though
(And if you're feeling particularly unhinged you could do multiple of these at once, but I would not recommend doing *no* math next semester)
do you have much experience with proof based math classes
unresolved... I gotta go deal with the damn facilty senate now
so the dean in charge of transfer credit said "I would accept it, but I don't have the authority to" so I logically ask "so who does?" and he goes "the facility senate"
I was stressing at my cc cause of withdrawing but I withdrew before the class actually started so it didn't count
History was a terrible class at my cc
This is a perfectly average first semester engineering schedule. It sucks the amount you would expect it to.
If you can stomach front loading it's not bad or anything, but I personally think that trying to take too many credits in your first semester risks making your adjustment to college way harder than it has to be
Even if you have freshman forgiveness, the time you spend in a class before you withdraw can still have a negative effect on your ability to learn from and stay on top of your other coursework
You should probably start by taking the calc 1 prof exam, then see if you can also get the calc 2 one done first semester. Then you could take a class like linear algebra that only requires calc 2 and take the calc 3 proficiency exam next semester
Why would you need to take 132 and 130?
I never understood the hate for morning classes
I tend to wake up early anyway so I'm probably
i havenâ€™t had a class but iâ€™m two of the german profs through german club and theyâ€™re great
8ams suck but 9:30 classes are fine imo
And even that was just cause I woke up earlier and then went back to bed lmao
Idk
I'm gonna be awake either way
im nit an early bird
Although the one thing that always threw me off was math at early hours cause my brain probably can't keep up with that right after waking up
I don't have to do chem or physics
Although to some extent physics might be useful if I want to do game dev
Idk
I woke up at 4:15 last seemster for week days, it's actually hella nice outside it's so peaceful and quiet
I don't think there's a huge difference in my morning routine either way tbh
I'll be working less hours in college than I did in highschool too
I woke up like 5:45 in high school too but in college I am sometimes too sleepy for a 9:30 class lol
From what I can tell work study jobs don't have you booked for many hours
I was working 29 a week in HS so
You will probably not do that in college
McDonald's wasn't fun but it was money
Fair enough
I think work study is capped at 20 hours a week
But I don't know anyone who hits that regularly
Cause In HS I didn't have to eat until I got there and cafeteria was like 2 mins away from my classes but in a whole campus that's different
damn so what do you recommend
i thought i had to bc of the plan of study
Oh rly?
there was a huge pile of boxes in office hours and after talking with her she said its a bunch of manga she bought saying "i need to stop"
Berkeley kink club is worse, my friend's brother went in and said kinkshaming was their kink and proceeded to kinkshame everyone and they couldn't say anything
I mean if it's what the plan of study recommends it probably knows better than me, it just seems weird because I don't know of majors that require both intro to Matlab and intro to java
Yeah, walking to class also never goes as fast as I hope 😭
Damn I stand corrected, apparently ee does require that now
I think maybe it just didn't used to
I know this anecdote is somewhat facetious, and I also think this isn't really the place to get into it, but I do think that is a strange and messed up thing to do for several reasons. 

1. He is entering these people's community space and taking advantage of their trust and good faith in order to belittle them. 
2. Even if we do take your friend's brother at his word kink requires consent, so just because he claims kinkshaming is his kink doesn't mean he is entitled to make fun of these people unless they give consent. 

They should have kicked him out and would have been completely justified in doing so.
Some of you are scary
asking bc i wanna get experience as fast as possible and as much as possible
Internships are quite hard to get and Iâ€™ve been reluctant to use connections to get them because that feels wrong somehow
Much of which is work that undergraduates can assist with
But also donâ€™t rush yourself in doing stuff, so I would honestly recommend not doing that freshman year. If anything do more courses freshman year
its really hard to get internships after freshman year unless you are just built different
nepotism only gets you so far tho
I only got internships through college because I went full sigma male grindset
in HS I just straight up cold called the CEO of a company and asked for an internship
damn that mustve been nice
we cant go past a certain amount of credits right?
@_zacc since your EE, what did you do freshman year?
yeah def don't do that freshman year
you arent allowed to go past 19 first semester anyway right? bc you need a gpa to get permission to take more
i mean not a terrible class to take
thats nice, my only problem is that i don't know what other class to take instead of java that would open more doors for me down the road
japanese sounds like a blast but, im likely gonna be working in europe or some company that doesnt really use japanese
like if theres a class/subject you enjoyed in hs that doesnt directly factor into ee you can see if theres an extension of that at cwru, or if theres something youve always wanted to learn about but never got around to or whatever
that just means your connection isn't in a high enough position
lemme cold call Jaime Dimon rq
although you might not be able to take it yet
who needs grass?
first year and change isn't terrible but like signals and systems, signal processing, and semiconductors are all pretty brutal
So elaboration @_cody17_:
Theta Chi is a diverse group of majors, although we do definitely have more of the STEM types. (We have been succeeding in getting more math majors in, and Zach our numbers will monotonically increase) Even though the "typical" Theta Chi plays plenty of board and video games and/or DnD, and I am not really that type, I still really enjoy it because my brothers are quite friendly and it's a nice place to feel home away from home
Off the top of my head, the majors that we have more than 1 of are: math, CS, physics, EE, chemistry, and psychology
don't we have 2 econ?
i thought someone else was doing econ as secondary but i may be misremembering
I'm saying this just to show that we're not a monolith, but it is still always important to talk to people outside of your frat and your major and your what-have-you because you don't want to become too isolated or echo-chamber-y (in the non-political sense)
Sorry I am just tripping
you can also rush any time after first semester if you really want
I also think you can't be on academic probation
Daniel Borhegyi (won't ping) rushed his sophomore fall and we had 2 people rush as spring sophomores
You should do what feels right to you, there are positives and negatives to any of it
personally i went in to college and knew what i wanted from the start, but I know others who would never have expected to end up where they did even at the end of their first semester
Nothing is lost from having a more diverse group of people to socialize with
The process is that fraternities have "rush" every semester, where at the beginning of the semester they hold events open to the public where you can go and get to know the active brothers (and of course, the active brothers get to know you), and you can do this for as many orgs as you wish at a time without there being any level of commitment or decision
Also important to note: returning a bid (for almost every frat) does not mean you're a brother. There's an additional 1-2 month long period where you make sure this is what you want (and of course, we make sure you're not secretly a terrible person or whatever), and when the time comes to fully initiate, you do not have to
I think zbt initiates people without a pledge period for example
So it depends. Most have a sort of trial period though where you can drop out at no personal risk (aside from any non-refundable fees)
I've changed a lot since freshman year though
If you haven't, you're doing something wrong
last I heard our zbt chapter has a 3 day pledge period
Theta Chi has had people rush their last semester of college... it is never to late to rush
yeah what i hadnâ€™t processed about college is that not knowing anyone when you come in means not only that you donâ€™t have friends, but also that thereâ€™s no one you can text if youâ€™re stuck on a homework problem or something. having a network of people you know outside of your close friends is important
obviously donâ€™t just make friends to ask them about homework. that should be self explanatory but iâ€™m realizing it maybe sounds like thatâ€™s what i was advocating there
Befriending people in your classes is nice, especially for major classes. You'll often see them again, and it's good to work through homework or study with someone in the same class
Idk how some of my friends get by not talking to anyone in their classes
yeah i didnâ€™t really make friends directly through classes, but esp freshman year a lot of people are taking the same classes so i met people other ways and ended up finding out we were in the same classes
Are the classes that big, damn
me personally iâ€™m oblivious to my surroundings, so there were a couple people i knew for a while before i realized they were in my ~40 person phys 123 class. but i also sat in the front so i didnâ€™t rlly see most of my classmates
Real shit
I didnâ€™t really meet that many people in my classes until I started taking more major-specific classes
Calc 1 or chem 111 in the fall? Absolutely. The average class at case, not really. The biggest class size I had in sophomore year was 120 (and that was a surprisingly popular elective with no enrollment cap). My smallest was a mere 12 people (and half of them didn't usually attend)
Then again, I also have majors that aren't really the biggest at case lol. A bio major probably has bigger classes for longer
case doesnt publish an average class size but 70% are under 30 people apparently
Dats good also the vibe Iâ€™m getting which makes me feel that I landed at the right school somehow
depends on the class
the lower the level the bigger the class generally
My class sizes last semester were probably about 12 18 18 20 30
one of my classes last semester was 3 people
what class had 3 💀
Whereas I think all of my other math professors have done at least one of these things
I would also warn people away from taking a class with roque sol
Wouldn't want to be unintentionally misleading
charlie took calc 3 twice to be able to compare professers better
Damn
which is why it was ncie that he was patient bc he didnt get irritated when i asked the same question 6 times in a row bc i didnt understand his explanations lol
i also had him when he took over for sell 4 weeks into the semester, in a class bigger than he usually teaches and he said himself he was only teaching bc he was the only one brave enough to do it--none of the faculty wanted to
you tried your best to teach me lagrange multipliers and that counts for something
um idk what they used to have - rn for math u only need calc 1 and 2 (I took 3 bc I had Ap credit for 1 and 2 and at the time I didnâ€™t know if I wanted to apply to med school and u need to take math at ur college for med school). No clue about physical chemistry
guilty as charged, made a reddit account after I got accepted and joined r/crwu to find roomates and navigate spring admission
Damn tempting
Once again this billion dollar Institution still has placeholder texts on their webpages
rip
That sounds awful
doubles arenâ€™t that bad idk
damn got a 25th
going with random roommate but i dont want a roommate with bo no offense 😭
I think it's nice to have a single if you can get one, but having a roommate isn't that bad
Generally it's nicer to not have to share a room, unless you really want to for some reason
But it seems true for some people
how much can RAs do though?
You can get a new room if itâ€™s bad enough I bet
I feel it would be rude to your roommate though
Second this. Where I'm currently at we had a roommate that left an entire floor smelling like super rank onions. It was unforgiving to the nostrils. She ended up being not a good person and just stopped paying rent.
damn 😭
RAs donâ€™t do shit except let you in your room when you forget your keys and tell you youâ€™re being loud
Except when u get called by some drunk kid at 3 am bc they forgot their IDs
Unless youâ€™re 21, but I donâ€™t know a single student who didnâ€™t drink as a freshman (not that I am encouraging you to, you should definitely not drink underage)
I think that speaks more to who you know.


I am 21 now and know several people who didn't drink until it was legal, and I also know a lot of people (I would say like 50% of the people I know) who still don't drink even though it is legal 

I think that if you drink/enjoy drinking you will meet other people who drink, and if you don't drink/don't enjoy drinking you will meet more people who don't
It seems like everyone is in agreement
Drinking is bad
Don't drink
I didnâ€™t drink as a freshman, although there was plenty of it happening on my floor
How else are you supposed to listen to the tunes?
Nothing can be worse than last semester
Its not ib though
No itâ€™s just uh literal college pfft
Yeah but like im used to literal college now too
This is how I got a math and CS double major in only TWO SEMESTERS (NOT CLICKBAIT!)
I do wonder what the least amount of semesters would be to get a math and cs double major
And even still it requires careful double counting
Iâ€™m doing a BS in both in eight semesters but I have a lot of free room, so I could probably do it in 7, but grad schools donâ€™t really accept people in the spring so no point
Honestly if you wanted a BA in both I bet you could do it in 5 semesters if you took 7 classes a semester (the max any sane person would ever do)
Itâ€™s really not as crazy as it sounds because a BA is 7 (!!!!!!) fewer CS courses, and two required math courses count as â€œCS coursesâ€, those being diff eq and abstract algebra
And same with math
I get the argument for CS BA but Iâ€™m already taking so many extra math courses that there is literally no point in going to a BA
donâ€™t you have to do like double geneds for that
Ehhh not really
At least Stellic doesnâ€™t seem to think so
Well I do have to do geneds from both but I donâ€™t have to do double SAGES or anything ridiculous like that
arenâ€™t the geneds in both the same? do you just have to take twice as many humanities/social sci classes
and 28ers would be under uger and not sages. iâ€™m not sure how dual degree stuff works though and i canâ€™t find a clear explanation on the website
more on this, it's much easier than it seems bc you literally have 3 years to do the careful double counting so it doesn't have to be a rush job at all
Ig if you know you want to head out in 3 years from the start you can, but it's not the kind of plan you make 5 and a half semesters in
All of the club pages seem dead
Except for dance and quizbowl
Lemme see if I can find what they're called
I don't know of a premed or prelaw club outside of these two
Fair enough, I shall go bother James Connolly
Wtf I just saw case is providing mini fridges now??????????
well as they should tho
tuition without scholarship expensive asf
Tuition with scholarship still expensive asf
its expensive for me too tho
private school experience(?)
i had to pay for my own fridge 😭 
tho i gave it to my roomie bc she used it a lot more than i
Scariest shit
no need to buy one now
timeslot changed from today to 27th, still says its ready rn but doesnt let me
just says this and I cant click so fun
Scared shitless rn
Not Yet im not
dawg im in italy i cannot do shit even during my timeslot 😭
Idk if anyone on this server is but I have some friends who are, you could probably reach out to them on insta if you want
Pi Kappa Phi is dead
It unfortunately shut down in 2023 \:-(
oh shit
Pi kappa phi chose to shut down because they couldn't get their numbers back up after covid . . . More or less
Greek life that has shut down voluntarily in the last five years:
Phi Kappa Tau (fraternity)
Pi Kappa Phi (fraternity)
Sigma Psi (sorority)
RIP Sigma Psi :(
Some have recovered, some are still recovering
Just a stone throw away
You just get to be worried about it longer
could i still try for another dorm
I donâ€™t think so
only one of you should be able to do it
I didnâ€™t have a specific time slot, I was just told I could come during any one of the times and pick a room
in nyc, thereâ€™s shit everywhere
Because the Mistletoe residences don't really have common rooms or anything, all rooms are roughly equal
our RA did maybe 2 events the entire year so i never really got to know many of them
I was on the football floor (thanks room selection!) and so I didn't talk to ANYONE on my floor regularly
i would do my homework in the common room at the beginning of the year but once football started it was over lol
rip the sherman pool table
Germany swept today, scots cant catch a break
And it's the college student aesthetic
BUT big tip here: try to spread out your stuff at least a little more than you need to at the start of the year, because if all of your stuff is neat and tidy and compact your roommate may (consciously or not) encroach on more than their fair share of the room
Oh I thought it was sarcastic
You do not live in the same buildings as a sophomore, so there is no need to, and it's not even a default assumption
You can get a new roommate second semester if need be, and you can even switch rooms in the middle of the semester if you have to for some reason, like @tazmania40 did
I lived on a lower floor
Pro: closer to the ground (of course)
Con: I was in the football frat so drunk singing from the common room at 3 AM happened occasionally
I canâ€™t remember the pricing of things but most people go unlimited
i heard a lot of ppl dont use all their swipes
But I canâ€™t remember what it is so maybe it makes sebse
I preferred mid loft where I could put my dresser under the bed to save space but didn't have to study under it. I don't like having to parkour into bed after turning the light off, accidentally hitting my head standing up after sitting at my desk (both of which my roommate had to do on a regular basis), or jumping down from the bed and hurting myself (also happened to my roommate)
17 + the portables shakes out to about 3 meals per day but you don't really get as much choice for each one as you do with unlimited
Either through their system, or by doing it yourself
I never used the system so idk how it works but you can definitely do this
even so, if you drink coffee or eat 3 or more meals a day and wont be routinely eating meals you have in ur dorm, u need unlimited
You're not supposed to alter the height of your bed by yourself tho, at least in the freshman dorms
You can put a sticky note at the notch you want your bed and submit the maintenance request, then they'll put it there
Can I still use the dining halls without swipes?
i deadass dont think I can spend 3900 on food in one semester
Yeah I did the math a while ago and it was closer to 30 but I bet the price went up
had a conflict with a roommate early in the semester and then pursued a medical single for related reasons. My former roommate is still a friend of mine, so no hard feelings in that regard. we just weren't compatible as roommates
Moving all those boxes was a bitch tho
I also have another friend who changed rooms due to roommate conflict and also medical reasons
There were hard feelings in that case tho
welp just woke up to my roommate telling me he found someone else 💀😭
Wtf
gotta go searching again now tho rip
man i was so relieved to have found someone from the same country as me
but then nope
which was still cheaper than meal plan
from like late march on i did this because it was physically easier on my body than cooking
and it gave me more time to catch up on the work i would miss when my flares would get really bad
as thick as a wiimote and longer
i need to know if i can make unhealthy choices
wingstop sucks, bww is better
I tried one pot yesterday and the Korean bbq was mid
Yeah, Barrio is worse than mid tbh
I just didn't like it
I went there once and I was like "Why did I pay so much for this sorry excuse for a taco"
I went to Barrio once. The tacos were expensive, the shells cold and the meat dry and flavorless. 

Cilantro on the other hand is cheap and really solid
oh fuck so real
I was like "why so ride or die for barrio"
nah i am ride or die for cilantro
Fair, I really gotta try it next semester
OH
i wonâ€™t stand for oscarâ€™s sittoos slander
brother have you tried bombay chaat?
Nope
Getting a nice warm bowl of pho from build the pho in the cold November winds after a long day of class😩🤌
the statement about chipotle needs more >'s. Idk how the one on cedar road is but the euclid chipotle is an abomination. Also Mitchell's #1 ice cream ever
Isnâ€™t koko bakery in Asia town
frankly jolly is overrated. meal swipe burgers are salty as hell and you cant get lettuce, tomato etc using a swipe
terrible opinion yeah
i dont have to take this from someone who orders his burgers without pickles (for freshman thats the one topping you can get on a swipe)
But itâ€™s only gone down hills
Might be??? Still dessert
i would not pay for it though
Oh and Leeâ€™s owner has a lambo
can't find any actual indictments though?? idk man the food is good at least
If you donâ€™t korea house in Asia town is solid too
I feel like Leutner doesnâ€™t get enough credit tbh, like their pasta stations are gas
isnt there gonna be a bombay chaat thing in tink next year
i might be remembering wildly wrong
and they said they were testing it to see if it would work as a permanent thing
i cant find anything about it
so i guess im wrong
Idk how I feel about Dunkin moving into tink
Cuz ik hella UH workers went there
i keep forgetting it wasnt always in tink
I don't even rememeber
I guess there's 2 now cuz there's definitely one in Asia town
Fair, idk I've barely gone to Asia town just because it's kind of a journey without a car
there's two koko bakeries, one on coventry and one on payne avenue
i prefer the one on payne even though it's quite a trip, though the rta is a lifesaver
the customer service imo is better though i might've just had a bad run-in
also the one in asiatown is right next to a banger noodle restaurant and mangomango :catsmirk:
its been temporarily closed for a bit tho
i think theyre moving locations?
oh damn it's open again? slay
We need to change the Euclid chipotle to a waffle house
â€œIâ€™m building a guitar pedal and am using diodes. I only have a few diodes and want to know if I can use the ones I have or if I need to get the specific diode thatâ€™s in the  schematic. Do diodes differ much? I know that resisters and capacitors need the specific value but my understanding is that diodes just have a power rating and other than that, it doesnâ€™t really matter which one you use. Is this true?â€
i want to abolish all mosquitoes from existence cuz wtf
Guess you gotta go bite the bug back and get even
what state you live in cuz I ain't seen a mosquito in 10 years😭
what the fuck how
well for 6 years back in Florida I never got bitten bc ig hella lizards be treating the jawn like a buffet, and I have no clue how I've never been bitten here
and I've spent summers here too when they're supposed to be active
hell I'm on campus rn and I haven't seen any
I havent seen any this year yet either, not complaining tho
if it rains on move in day I'm leaving
It wonâ€™t, just gotta manifest that it wonâ€™t
Build a weather machine
Use lots of pesticides and end up also killing most if not all other insects 🥰
We already have Bab's weather machine
Actually, now that I think about it, I canâ€™t remember the last time I saw a ladybug. Thatâ€™s actually really sad and I really hope they arenâ€™t going extinct or anything
(Even though thatâ€™s never how it turns out)
Yeah, itâ€™s convenient tho
wasn't last year sunny
im in india rn and dying
and yk whats worse
I am high enough in the mountains that I can still see snowy hillsides and there are no mosquitoes to be found
simply don't go outside
ugh
when i visited the countryside i went outside to pick berries and came back with 30-40 fresh bites
including on the back of my head 😭
Idk for me personally when Iâ€™m regular drunk itâ€™s just like a lot of goofy silly stuff, but if I get wine drunk I start saying unhinged shit
wine drunk is a headache, regular is rushing the front lines
I didn't use any when I was in the dorms
we cant even finish races rn
Double dnf had me cackling tho
hard slicks in the rain 💀
Ferrari just didnâ€™t want to be like the other girls 🎀
I will forever hate that safety car tho
it pissed me off that lando didnt pit before oscar when it happened
They were trying the Miami Strat 😭
they hate having a good thing - look at how they broke up charles-carlos
I got a bingo square for Canada tho
i have never done f1 bingo
I thought it wouldnâ€™t happen but Ferrari always pulls through
this looks cool damn
mid season red bull swap doesnt look likely since they just extended checo
Yeah, Iâ€™m still hoping for vcarb to do something
Long shot tho
itâ€™s incredible how bad perez is doing
Who would they put in tho
Fair
he came close so many times
Im gonna be on a plane during the race so I guess Iâ€™ll just be connecting to a satellite to watch
i dont see that many mclaren fans - only one ik is my suitemate
RAHHHHH I want to go to a race
im hoping for chicago gp to become official
isnt lewy out
the spotlight isnt on lewnagoalski now like it was before
i would just find someone who can drive and go
f1 wants street circuits and cota expires in 26
oh loll
if only i had a car
what the fuck is overtaking
if theres a couple of people going - just rent a car
Oh facts
maybe i could borrow my parents car or smth
Slightly illegal but itâ€™ll work
Or just stop speaking English
Light work
upto yall ngl 
server would be more detailed but like too much work
a while back it used to be possible to get automated tickets at an intersection and get your picture taken for proof, but since you couldnt clearly see my mom's face, my dad made the case that you cannot believe beyond reasonable doubt that the driver was her and not a filipino relative or friend
he took a photograph of my mom and other filipino friends, covered the eyes and said to the officer "who is the defendant" officer points to wrong person
So it didnâ€™t take a picture of the license plate to send the ticket through?
They suck
cuz her face was not 100% visible in the picture
So the judge just dismissed the ticket or it went to the jury?
you don't need case cash
If you can get the money instead of the case cash it's more useful
Gonna do community college if I donâ€™t get a 5 on BC
dw the curve is really generous
only AP class I ever took
Currently doing dci, marching for bdb, anyone else doing any open class corps?
Couldnâ€™t justify the cost or time
Oh damn 🤣 that's..... Just a bit far u know?
Any plans to march in the school marching band?
I might eventually do dca, I just donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d be able to fit it into my life
thats sick im going to watch dci west
- do you all hate Bostonâ€™s uniforms as much as I do?
Theyâ€™re horrible
THO BDA UNIFORMS R FR FIRE
Even tho im marching bdb
one of the rising juniors from my school is on trumpet i think
Bd just doesn't make entertaining shows, they rlly just going for points
You just hit the nail on the head
I don't rlly like dark themes in general
Shows like babylon, which were hella fan faves just didn't hit the same for me
Just preference tho
thats fair
Oh..... 🫢 I'm sorry
It was funâ€¦ until it wasnâ€™t
Nope 🤣
Not broken or thrown out
Nope, neither is my right thumb having to support the weight of the whole thing
Oh ye.... It's not my back, it's my thumbs 😭😭😭
Uuuuhhh haven't rlly looked into their bands 🤣🤣🤣
Oh damn, gl gl
I'm just trying to keep it as a hobby, nothing about going into music
thats fair
do we still send roommate requests if we selected single dorm?
According to the Internet there was definitely a taekwondo club in 2017, but I'm not sure if they are still around . . .
my brain is broken
Just got another email about someone dying
Why is everybody dying 😭
Feel like I'm gonna walk on campus and immediately get out on a timer
thats so real they just keep dying
On the bright side case students die very rarely
the only thing you have to look out for is getting hit by a car on euclid
and even then i think its like a single person every month or 2
I do know a lot of people who have gotten hurt on an electric scooter, bike, or skateboard though. Ride at your own risk
Yeah, and I think most people hit by a car don't die
Could be wrong but I'm fairly sure
we didn't have any fatalities last year afaik
I think this is right, there was one in our freshman year though
Cw: death ||a guy on a skateboard got hit and killed by a car by the Starbucks. Or well, he was in critical condition and later died in the hospital||
true i am not dead
Case is in a city. People are bad drivers. Be aware of things
i got lucky that i didnt hit my head
The shuttles seem too be the worst from what Iâ€™ve heard/observed on my visit
im lucky i hit the brakes on my scooter in time and that they werenâ€™t turning very fast but it wasnt a fun experience mentally
From what I've heard about NYC, it's probably much less bad
reminds me of the time i was on a city bike and i hit a car in pouring rain because he swerved in front of me and my brakes didnt do much bc if the rain 😭
people here dont know how to drive
Apparently you can
oh god i cant even imagine
Drivers in Cleveland have somewhere to be and they don't really respect you . . . But they're not usually exceedingly stupid in pursuit of that goal
oh
i watched someone honk at an old man crossing the road so they could turn 5 seconds sooner
When my brother came to visit me, we were walking to Hell's and I said "look, in a few seconds someone is going to come around this corner even though it's not their turn to go"
We were crossing the crosswalk, and guess who goes through it 10 feet in front of us when they have a red
People mostly respect traffic lights I would say, aside from "but it just turned red"
They do not respect pedestrians tho
who needs signals
cant let them know your next move
Nah the mf pedestrians will start crossing with like 3 seconds left on the lights and slow walk that shit
got lucky and didnt fall or anything and apparently a passerby said it looked sick
the old ones dont?
Just saw someone at fairfax market wearing a CWRU 2027 shirt I feel so old
Nope, but you don't really need it
is there something wrong with duo? it says i need a bypass code to log into the housing portal
Weird, I've never seen that before
oh man
did it work before?
it did this yesterday idk
aw man
have you tried clicking that settings button?
do we still look for roommates even if we selected single dorms as our preference
You shouldnt have to
you should still find some tho j to be safe cause I dont think theres alot of single rooms
Wet roads can make it slippery but itâ€™s really hard to truly hydroplane because your tire contact patch is so small
Riding a road bike in the rain is not super fun though
I wouldn't know, as I've never ridden a bike
I'm from Las Vegas, so unfortunately yes
If you have enough money to pay the remaining costs outright I assume doing the plus loan is a bad idea no
Depends how much strain it would take to pay the rest, and what the interest on the loan is, and how quickly you intend to pay off the loan. 

If the interest on the loan is low enough and you set aside money while you are a student (and that money keeps up or out performs the interest on the loan) then you might as well take the loan IMO
cleveland traffic is mild
Jersey traffic is disgusting
Youâ€™d rather borrow money from your family if you can
The loans that don't accumulate interest or require payments until you graduate can be kind of strategic though, because due to inflation you'll pay less in a few years
but they havenâ€™t gotten back to me yet
How am I supposed to select a room 💀💀
It says my timeslot was an hour ago
I mean like I'm not even supposed to fill it out I don't think given GIH but still
I still don't know if I even got into GIH
Like they sent me the whole questionnaire on the 6th and said if you plan on doing it don't select a room
But what if you don't select a room and they then don't accept you so they put you in like Clarke tower or something
Unfortunately for single room accommodations, most singles are in Clarke. Just by numbers
Apparently
Imo they should expand gih past one quad so they don't have to deny anyone, but I'm not in charge
Hey you you arenâ€™t trans enough
But I dunno
I don't know if that has anything to do with their denial necessarily, but I think the people who designate gih probably consider who would be actively unsafe with a potential random roommate
So I don't think the people in charge are like, trying to actively gatekeep
I have no idea what their actual methodology is, but I would imagine they probably prioritize people who become a lawsuit waiting to happen otherwise. (Ie. Imagine what happens if a cis woman gets a random roommate who happens to be a trans man who's been on hormones for a year, bad news for everyone involved)
But honestly, I don't think the university overall cares all that much, or else they'd have the option for way more gih
trying to make it fit the theme
Even though it still doesnt
i guess not
You can live on the same floor as gih without being gih
:worried:
I will ping when he's up, but @ Daniel Borhegyi (CS '26) has taken that class and has also been a TA for it so he can probably give you some tips
cause yk
Haven't said anything about the seminars or when I am taking mine yet so I really don't know
my advisor says early july
I took 4 college classes and two high school classes my last year so I am praying I can handle 5
I also need to figure out if my courses will transfer cause of the whole
Damn that's wild
I make about as much as a junior EE at my internship, it's just only 3 months
Damn
which isn't a lot tbh $25 an hour is only 52k a year
:sigh:
trying to find other things to throw into my cart
but i already have 3 classes on monday wednesday and friday so it would be even more unbalanced if i added another
I wanted one so bad but mine was like broken and I never got around to getting it fixed
But the trek from freshman dorms to the quad is very annoying
@weli___ idk if you might know
Don't get a mac
Save yourself the pain of needing a virtual machine
feel free to reach out if you have questions. I was on the executive board last year and am on the operations board this year (we did a little restructure so the engineering and admin are more separated). I've been doing it since freshman year asw
Donâ€™t quote me Iâ€™m not ws
In what regard? If you have work study you can apply to work study only jobs on campus. You still have to apply, interview, and get the job yourself. But the source of the money you make is from the work study grant, not the organization that hires you, until you hit a certain threshold
There are a lot of different options for work study applicable jobs, but they're not always easy to get hired at
monday wednesday saturday, honestly more
don't listen to zacc he lying
just some lame baja pics
supercar is because honda/acura are buddies with Baja SAE (we have a few people on the team that work for acura now), second pic is the first comp I went to in upstate NY, third is drive back home from TN comp to NC, fourth is walk back from the practice track in Arizona, and fifth is the view from the Arizona competition paddocks
but pretty much everyone gets to drive the car at various points
oh we have a chunk of an acura NSX hood in the bay that we won
they really are
we do some stuff with 3d printing instruments at work
where's work?
:pain:
More than working fast food or retail would 💀
i dont think i'll ever be one of those "oh yeah I interned at boeing and got paid $30 an hour"
ive heard its best to get as close to your preferred area of study as possible
even if you cant be doing the job you want to be at least being in the building with someone who is doing that job helps
That's probably true. I'm still figuring it out myself. I'm working at thinkbox on the outreach team over the summer which doesn't have to do much with computer science but I do get to make a number of technical projects and I'm practicing meeting a lot of people from tons of different companies and places so I do think it's still worth it. It's also really fun which is secondary but important imo
This photo was NOT taken from the roof of Clarke Tower
rooftop access would be so sweet, a real shame (though i can guess why its not legal)
Idk if it's fully illegal, but definitely not allowed by the school or RAs
Iâ€™m getting paid $12 an hour at my research internship 😭😭😭
bc itâ€™s just a stipend but I work full time
$4k for 8 weeks + housing + flights
but taxes r gonna kill my paycheck
I have no idea whats gonna happen there I'm just praying it's not so little that I could be better off getting a normal job in that timeframe 😭
Semi relying on them to pay for college eventually
The 3k/yr after the federal loans is coming out of my mom's pocket and asking someone who makes 18k a year to pay 1/6 of that for my college doesn't seem right
Or during the school year
Like I want to pay for it and also not have issues paying for anything else
Id make around 3k purely work study
Cwru expects my dad to pay 1/4 of his salary which never makes sense to me and is more annoying bc heâ€™s not paying shit
I wouldn't be able to buy much of anything else though
Technically itâ€™s half if they consider the fact I have a sibling in college
I don't think she is though
Terrible loan
Itâ€™s not that bad itâ€™s like 8% but ya the interest catches up
I mean they call it The Farm for a reason don't they
i dunno what they call it :abceshrug:
Some of the cutest creatures smell terrible
Cleveland weather is unusually California-like right now
Hutchings why are you still on campus by the way
Last week was hell
Rip
Weather so bad they moved us to STJ for a week
This seems like a common theme
People see the cost of cali living and are like: fuck this shit im out
They just canâ€™t handle the best stats in the union 😔
I havenâ€™t been to cali so idk if itâ€™s the best but my friends arenâ€™t big fans of it
Did your friends visit anywhere that wasnâ€™t near the coast though
Smh what's the point of California without the ocean part
Yeah itâ€™s still that
(Math reference!!!)
Housing selection also isn't over as far as I know, there's probably some rooms in Smith that still haven't been claimed
Tomorrow as in the 26th morning Japan time idk zimetone
Seems real long so dw
Wonâ€™t be here before we know it
Move in day wonâ€™t suddenly be tomorrow or anything
No never
I want it to be, i want more school
And it still is
Like i took my couple weeks of break, got back from vacation, and now im ready for more
After my freshman year was over I relaxed for about two days and then decided it was time to learn more math so I downloaded a random book from the Internet and got to it
me either
adam if you wanna do math so bad you should come to baltimore and take my diffeq test tomorrow
Iâ€™m in CLE I canâ€™t
Actually what are the books for the case math classes youve taken, maybe i can find them and be more prepared when i have to take the classes
Speaking of vacation, i saw someone doing linear algebra hw on the flight back home
I have taken Calc III, Diff Eq, Discrete, Linear, Abstract, Real I/II, Knot Theory, Quantum Computing. And Graph Theory
All had textbooks except for quantum and knot theory
I have all textbooks except for linear algebra
Iâ€™m here for the sarcasm and memes not math
I think it said case uses the 3rd edition not the 2nd but canâ€™t be that much different
I got that book first semester, professor said it wasn't required so I returned it to the campus bokstore and got a refund 1 hour before the return period ended 😎
Oh i know i hate it
theyre moving away from this one to the open source apex textbook
i think last sem was the pilot semester for that
Thats cool, when i took calc 1 at csu they were still using this book but piloting openstax and then when i took calc 2 it was just openstax. But if you need to take calc 3 they still make you get this textbook 😭
tbh I don't use textbooks as much as maybe I should
I can count the number of times I opened the abstract algebra book on my fingers, and still would be able to even if both of my hands converged to zero
no same im so bad at parsing information from textbooks
can't stand flipped classrooms tho
like probably phys 122 wouldve gone better if id just buckled down with the textbook but i did not do that
I did this to my own detriment a bit in my English class... still ended with a 99 or something stupid because he loved my writing
but reading high level math textbooks makes my brain hurt
I normally do all my readings in social studies classes but in my aiqs we were supposed to read this book I already read part of for high school classes so I basically just said nah Iâ€™m not doing that again
is it very difficult to get RA positions? just wondering
I never selected a room
i feel your pain
@jetsunami and I teamed up for 3 hours
And I got tipped a Starbucks gift card
I was dying
trying to help apparently
I don't even remember how long I did I was there till lunch
Wanted to jumpstart my adjustment to EDT
Idk when we're leaving for retreat but if it's not in the afternoon I might stay and help this year
rs tho I will never forget the group of dudes that helped me move into my room albeit I was too tired to remember which fraternity they were in
sad
could be either
It's really hard to get rid of a keloid
maybe its not a keloid idk
its red tho
I just raw dogged my piercings never cleaned them or nothin
this is according to what is on the website for students entering fall 2023, it hasnâ€™t been updated for fall 2024 yet
one difference i know of is that all nursing students take the required seminar in the fall semester
:0 don't be shy share the simulation schedule with the class
iâ€™m struggling to find a breadth class because the one i wanted to take needs a prereq and is a lvl 300 so my advisor said wait to take it until at least sophomore year
Damn that sucks
Donâ€™t know enough about sports medicine to help unfortunately :(
That's totally fair too! Take the time to recover from your injury
I've taken 5 total so far (all in the math department lol)
With those stickers as eyes, looks like a robot in scifi from 1975
I would like one as enthusiastic about math like my calculus teacher in highschool
What are you looking at taking for math next semester
sorry but no ones better than MY ap calc ab teacher 😤
I think Iâ€™ll have to retake calc 2 sadly
If I donâ€™t get a 4
are u doing math 122 then
And perhaps calc 1 if my subscore isnt a 4 either
Just in case you have the wrong impression, you need an ap calc 5 to get credit at case
bro wtf 😭
Yeah you can also proficiency exam it
They offer a placement exam before the semester so you can just skip
I think most people don't bother
You don't need an English credit to graduate anyway
Cause I can like everything tbh
As a math major, taking introductory CS is good because knowing how to code somewhat is massively useful for math
Not really breadth in the traditional sense but still good
Canâ€™t read or write but can speak
Tbh I do not plan to ever take csds 132 at Case because from my understanding, it's very hard if you don't know anything about coding
Oh neat are you Chinese?
I would say if you can't read or write, you probably want to take the intro class
The spoken part will be ezpz but you don't want to be thrown into the deep end
Like 4 years of studying a language in high school is probably the equivalent (or less) of the first semester or two of a college language
I think everyone that takes the AP class of any language gets a 4-5 because itâ€™s like their house mother tongue
they donâ€™t even have to try
and then the people that donâ€™t have any parents that speak it that do take the class are just exceptional
There was a time that I briefly considered trying to study math and classics, but the language requirement is too brutal and I would've started way too late
I was put in Chinese school for a brief amount of time as a kid but they all already spoke Chinese and I didn't know shit 😭
So I didn't last very long
Damn LMAO
My mom put my sister and I at chinese school, I couldnâ€™t even do the booklets 😭
Really tokenmaxxing over here
I go sleep 🫡
Charlie guess what time zone Iâ€™m in
I donâ€™t get to sleep
Close but no cookie
Sad
I do a little suffering (delays made it so that I have a 12 hour layover and I canâ€™t check my bag yet so I canâ€™t sleep either)
How long have you been awake
It seems like a whole
I slept on the plane thankfully
Damn
What happened
He's trying to fix his sleep schedule
Because yesterday he was trying to fix it with an all nighter but accidentally slept from 11am to 6pm
Bruh wtf
Yeah he's still fucked up from jet lag like 2 weeks ago
And if you sleep at the wrong time you are just cooked
Anyway I need to go shower and be asleep
i cried taking 2 tests so he would tell me how to set up problems and if i was doing them correctly
When you take proofs based math classes you start to miss the ease and comfort of calculus
took a discrete math class last summer which was proof based and it was my fav thing
But sometimes they make me sad on the inside
I havenâ€™t ever really done proofs and I have no desire to begin
i did formal logic (philosophy proofs sorta) at a summer camp in middle school and that was neat but math proofs scare me
I have a love hate relationship with calc 3 - I enjoyed the class but it also was really difficult cause my mind hates thinking in 3D
the 2 page long proofs hurt a bit
100 person lecture, and i do best in much smaller class environments, plus the prof changed a couple weeks into the semester and the new one assigned a bunch of homework with the intention that we work in groups to do it, but my group didnt talk to one another so it was just a ton of work
Okay yeah I wouldnâ€™t have enjoyed that either so makes sense why you didnt like it
Y'all math majors in the chat will understand this eventually
calc 3 was the only college math class that I really enjoyed
Based on my calc teacher at school
Iâ€™ve had enough complex to not want to touch it anymore lol
Divergence and convergence was the worst part of 2 😭😭
ugh
dont remind me
i grinded the fuck out of series in hs and hated it at the time but liked it when i retook calc 2 in college
Dude thereâ€™s no way you can remember all 9 tests unless you dedicated a whole month of thought to it 😭
we were given like 2 weeks max to process all the tests
What level of math is this?
I will be there (although I donâ€™t know all of their music as of rn)
Naw. Idk when youâ€™d see it but your diff eq class will be on ODEs not PDEs
partial diff eq. you won't touch it much except for a little in classes like 350
as long as they havent committed a felony
not big on insta anymore
i used insta to contact during school projects 😭
real, except now discord (modding) is apparently what people tend to perceive in my identity
I wish but not as many people use it I feel like
i didnt have insta for the longest time, i now have an account but i dont have the app downloaded, i only log on in desktop
the ones who don't I just text
True it just takes a tiny bit more work
Like any other messaging app I am horrible at responding but Iâ€™m actually good at responding in a timely manner in discord
my insta got hacked freshman year like. the week after i had started adding people in my classes and since then ive been too afraid itll happen again to add people with my new account
i vastly prefer discord though
asiatown isnt a *huge* place; unless you plan to like dine somewhere it'll be hard to fill up 4 hours time :UwU:
Granted I'll prob work less cause I was doing 29 hours a week at McDonald's but still
i dont think this is for student employees? cuz i swear i was being paid less than 15 before anyway? idk
Oh yeah it says university employees
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s for students
10.45 and apparently schools can pay 85% of minimum wage but thats still over $8
7.25 is federal minimum wage but that would mean case qualifies for an exemption from ohios minimum for some reason but idk why they would be
okay apparently the 85% thing isnt relevant to this situation but its not unheard of for colleges to have work study stuff in line with federal minimum wage but under state minimum wage
It's 4 hours a week
But still you'd think a class that requires managing other students and training would pay more than 7.25
Dang they only have this up for 2 weeks
At least in the ECSE department TAs make $14.30 an hour. 

I think it is $13 in the MATH and ENGR department 

Other departments I couldn't tell you about but I would be shocked if any department was actually under $11
4 hours a week for 3 chipotle bowls is wild
Guys anyone in class of 28 able to find their ap scores on the case sis/portal
If I wanted to attend the yapathon I wouldâ€™ve signed up for it goddam
Did u check ur email? Bc I wasn't able to get a room and they sent me an email today telling me my room assignment
Didn't update the checklist tho
Nah I haven't
I was supposed to do GIH but they've been radio silent ever since they sent out a form for if we were still interested
Told us to skip room selection if we wanted to do it but an update would be nice 😭
Damn that sucks try emailing housing that's what I did after I failed room selection and they told me to tell them what dorms I wanted and I got my top dorm so
I know from last year they responded pretty late. Thatâ€™s actually why I didnâ€™t live in gih - me and my roommate just wanted our housing situation figured out
Thatâ€™s weird, cuz they replied back straight away to my roommate and me
Well maybe in half a week but still relatively quick
i sent a permission request to a prof to get into the sci fi english class and he responded in literally six minutes
and then others just wont respond for months
I believe it's the same hazing training for clubs/club sports, I don't think you have to do it again.
I'm not gonna have a car
Cause I'd have to pay to like Lyft or Uber to Cleveland since it's 30 mins out
Honestly have no idea what either of those are 😭
Transport to and from campus (flights/gas money)
the train is totally sufficient it just takes longer
Itâ€™s still under an hour usually, so not too bad. You have to make sure not to fly in past midnight though because they shut down service past downtown from about 12:30-4am
Still technically doable but you have to take the health line from tower city station and it just takes forever

 I lied about the laptop I ended up getting this
I've never used Linux or anything like it before
Or unless you need gcc or ros or something that only runs on Linux
My school didn't offer aps
I have just now realized how much of a mess my OS world is
I use MacOS for most stuff, a Debian VM for personal linux-ing, a very heavily modified version of Ubuntu for work, an ubuntu LTS release for ROS on its own workstation, a windows 11 VM for NX and Altium on my macbook, and then a beefy windows 11 tower for gaming and more hard core CAD
honestly i'm really impressed with my m1 mac and windows 11 running in parallels
Though where does this show up
You can always walk away from the stupid shit people are pressuring you to do
I cannot speak for every fraternity but mine doesn't do any hazing bs
ive heard sigma chi is a bit more in the hazing direction (pledges running around naked in the snow etc) but its hearsay so could be wrong
Tbh hazing just makes you look kinda stupid. Like, you're letting someone tell you to dance like a chicken, give yourself alcohol poisoning, or do 20 pushups on their demand? Don't let people do this shit to you, for any reason
Seconded for us. Hazing is a BIG no-no. When I was a pledge I wasnâ€™t even allowed to help with dishes
Damn, what if you really wanted to help clean up
Yeah looking back it was a smart move. I still tried to help out where i could though
I remember one time I visited my friend's room and we kept trying to be a good guest/host to the point we were both trying really hard to clean up simultaneously
Oh gotcha
Iâ€™m new to this I donâ€™t know all the rules 💀 my bad
Fair enough but until I'm over the poverty line money will always be a huge factor in my life 😭
Personally the money I save on room and board in my chapter makes up for the dues that I pay, but this isn't the case for every chapter
I get that yeah. But dues can be pricey too, and itâ€™s really not worth being in a house thatâ€™s $100 cheaper with 20 people that you hate
Idk what the high end is tbh
Many chapters will be able to guarantee on campus housing for under and upperclassmen though
And while some scholarships and stuff can go towards housing, idk if much can go towards frat dues
I'm happy to answer further questions about my experience, but unfortunately I do not know everything
is there like a portal where we can see our AP scores? Bunch of friends at ohio state got their AP scores early because they got uploaded to portals so wondering if we have any similar exploit
oh I didn't finish step 5 of that thing
Has anyone seen a transfer on credit for apush?? idk if thats j bc u have to take hsty 100
I havenâ€™t so idk
If you need a separate requirement like hsty 100 it won't show up anyway
Disappointed but not surprised
Calc bc definitely didnt get a 5 on 😭
if they count towards your hs graduation credits they wont accept it
All my dual enrollment was surplus and taken at the college, so I should be good unless they say the content doesnâ€™t match
taken at the college with college degree seeking students?
the college prof coming to our hs, to it being online, to being on the college campus for finals
every class we took was the same class the adults would be taking
has anyone here had any experience hitchiking or planning on staying in a town alone for a few days?
I just donâ€™t think itâ€™d be safe going alone into a strangers car unless youâ€™re armed
When do we start looking at getting a job on campus for federal work study?
y'all don't do informals?
We donâ€™t give out many late bids and anyone who returns them later usually gets put in with next semesterâ€™s associate member class
ohâ€¦!!
No late bids is wild missing out on major opportunities
I believe itâ€™s the same here. @dborhegyi would know more tho
But isnâ€™t it 2 days off + 2 weekend days?
I think we operate pretty differently from you guys lol, if we think thereâ€™s an opportunity for a late bid weâ€™ll probably give it out but it doesnâ€™t happen very often
There isn't informal because we have two rush seasons, fall and spring. Both work basically the same way except spring tends to be a bit more small-scale. Between those two, most fraternities don't send out bids at all. Sororities on the other hand have a formal recruitment in spring, which is a little more of an involved process, then they have informal in fall which is less involved but idk the exact details of it
Yeah, don't sororities have quotas or something like that? Where if they don't meet that minimum they go into "continuous open bidding" until next formal or when they meet those numbers? It was explained to me before but idk if I retained all of it lol
Tbh this is why I don't go home for fall break or thanksgiving
I don't enjoy spending 10 hours of my break on a plane
My mom doesn't love not seeing me during the semester but she also wouldn't love paying for a flight home 😭
but but what if you get a crying baby and the person is snoring on your flight where the restroom is always occupied after you got to spend bonus hours in an airport because your flight was delayed
Yeah I stayed at case during fall break but I go home for thanksgiving bc yummy food. It was tiring tho I literally flew in on Thursday and I just fell asleep at my grandparents house
I guess I could see the appeal during freshmen year if it is financially possible because it is most people's first time away from home but it is definitely is a big undertaking
I'll do you one better than that. Imagine your flight being delayed nearly 7 hours so you manage to miss your connecting flight and get stranded in Charlotte, North Carolina for the night where you aren't technically old enough to get your own hotel room. (This happened to me once)
Tbh my family also doesn't really do "thanksgiving" as a big holiday celebration
So I don't care that much about it
For clarity, this did not happen on a flight from Cleveland, but it did happen when I was trying to go to Cleveland
From the people I've talked to, no, not really
Not an upperclassman and IDK about other schools, but I have never found myself in any situation where that was even a concern.
cuz i heard stories in irvine where
thats so scary tho
Yeah I remember having people warn me about that sort of thing before starting college, but I've never had to be concerned about it. Then again I'm the last person you'd find in a party scene so 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
I've definitely heard stories about students getting alcohol poisoning or blacking out, but that's usually due to their own poor choices
I don't drink and I have been with people who drink and I have never felt pressured to drink - tho same as Amitan im not really on the partying scene
Tbh I don't even like going to events where people are drinking most of the time
I've only ever gone for zombieoke lol
I don't go every Thursday but I like to go if I'm feeling it
But it doesn't have everything unfortunately
if u don't believe this u can watch the livestream
will I survive chem 111 if I never took chem in hs?
I feel like I doomed myself by not taking it
but I also could never fit it in my schedule
Like you never took intro to chem at all?
yeah I was thinking about doing some pre-chem work over the next month
Yeah that's why I wanted to clarify
since AP has a separate mechanical and magnetism exam
Like, you learn some things about notation, style of problems, and lab software from 121. But 122 doesn't build on it directly
@roguish_raven do you know how scheduling works? like I took a few classes but didnâ€™t get AP credit for them but I still want credit for them without retaking
Ik we can test out but should I put the same class into my scheduling cart?
Check if there is a proficiency exam for it then take said proficiency exam during orientation week
If you don't have credit for calc 2 for example, but you have credit for calc 1. Put calc 2 in your shopping cart and then enroll in it, if you pass the proficiency exam during orientation week you can drop calc 2 and get into calc 3 instead
what if I donâ€™t have credit for either?
You won't be able to take a class if you don't have credit for its prerequisite
Can I test out of calc 2 after taking calc 1 then?
Then take the calc 1 proficiency exam during orientation week and talk to the math department to try to take a calc 2 proficiency exam during the first week of class
Unfortunately during orientation week the calc 1 and calc 2 proficiency exams happen at the same time
You probably won't have an issue getting into calc 2
Check the website and if it's still unclear, send an email to someone in the math department. Probably Chris Butler
2-3ish hours?
Probably a max of 3 hours
That's how final exams are structured at least
oh itâ€™s just a straight final exam? 😭
And I think you need 70% or 75% to get credit
oh dang
Imagine it like a final exam or an AP test
It's like saying "I already know the class material, just give me the exam"
I have no idea, I've never taken one
What's the calc proficiency exam like?
Enrolling in a class doesn't remove any other classes from your shopping cart, just that one
On the enrollment screen you can "validate" your classes to check if there's any overlap between courses in your shopping cart, but it doesn't stop you from trying to enroll in them
The validate function can tell you if there's an overlap, but it doesn't solve it for you
will it still let you enroll even if thereâ€™s an overlap?
There are standard timeslots for most classes, but sometimes they can still get messy
do you think I need write my classes down on paper and organize it?
Usually recitations are with a TA and go over class material or homework questions
so would a recitation class have lecture + recitation?
There are lecture, seminar, discussion, and lab courses which can stand alone. Recitations usually go hand-in-hand with a lecture course
wtf
Not really
Majors with mostly Tuesday Thursday classes don't usually have classes with recitations (for example psychology or anthropology)
so it doesnt matter what time
Oh yeah I forgot, calc 2 recitations all happen at the same time
would there really only be 50 in recitations?
11:30 to 12:20? I thought it was 8:30 to 9:20 (which is why i want to get out of it)
i feel like there would be more
lectures are 11:30-12:20 for everyone it seems
Depends on the course, but usually they don't want to overwhelm the TAs with too many students
Unfortunately off-semester calc 1 and 2 only have one option, and it's usually early morning
since it doesnâ€™t matter
thereâ€™s no recitation for calc 1 it seems
For some reason not all classes on there are formatted the same and i hate it
Do labs really take 3 hours?
what could possibly make a lab 3 hours?
Some people finish early but I was rarely able to
The reports were the absolute worst part of physics
we didnâ€™t have to 10 pages
Like I can get you the numbers but explaining how I managed that was always bad
The 121 and 122 physics labs are really tedious, but they're not that hard
most difficult physic class i took was h physics 🧍🏻â€â™€ï¸
I don't know exactly how it compares to physics C because I never took AP physics
Yeah I failed the exam for that class 💀
My friends who took AP physics c and got 4s and 5s in high school thought 121/122 were not that bad
Ok thatâ€™s fair
35% on the ap exam is about a 4
This is the opinion of some of the professors for how the grades should work
My test average in physics 121 was about a 70%, but I managed an A at the end
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have an issue then
I was averaging about 40% each PhysC test last year
Do you remember what the breakdown was between tests and homework and anything else?
Physics 122 the homeworks were pretty hard but I actually thought the tests were quite easy, then again I had already taken calc 3 and worked with imaginary numbers when I took it and that helped my ability to figure things out
121 was 25% lab 25% midterms 20% homework and 30% final or something along those lines
wtf
122 was like 25% lab 30% midterms 30% final 15% homework
I think the highest exam weighted class I ever took was 35% one midterm 45% final exam
Not really
damn
Unfortunately calc 1 and 2 are going to be morning classes every semester
but I didnâ€™t have my first class until 8:45
what do you recommend class load per semester?
Some people will tell you to do more 😭 doesn't work for me so I don't bother
burnout will happen fast 😭
like my sister was crying last semester at harvard because of the workload
I've heard a legend of a man who took a 30 credit semester to graduate in 4 years with a double major in computer science and mechanical engineering. His name? Cooper. I have a theory that he's the reason there's a hard cap on credit overload now
I was going to say isnt 23 the max
How many classes did he have to overlap??? Theres not enough time in the days
yeah 9-10 classes in a semester wtf
u have to get perms for that tho no?
It doesnt seem like its hard to though, just your advisor saying yes i think
I would not recommend taking more than 19 credits unless you absolutely have to to graduate though
The most I've taken and completed in a semester is 17
I mean do you really need to participate in clubs, you could just take another class or two (dont listen to me)
I tried taking 19 plus an ensemble last semester and withdrew from a course, so I have a big fancy W on my transcript
I was not forced to withdraw, but I chose to because I realized the class was overwhelming enough that it was hurting my performance in all my other classes
Idk, im weird im someone who actually has fun from taking more classes than i should and not having time for other activities
I donâ€™t feel like hs prepared me at all 💀
I havent tested it in a while but i was around 85 too a year ago
i feel like mindset is rly important too
dont set urself to failure cuz ur convinced u cant deal w ur workload
College is not that bad - just donâ€™t overload and you will be fine. Even if you overload it will work out
Introductory courses are intended to get people from all sorts of backgrounds on the same level. They might seem tedious or like "weed out courses" (and sometimes they are), but they don't want you to fail. They want you to graduate
on a computer its 120
i thought you meanâ€™t computer
oh thats still insane tho
My internet is being bad rn, but when it loads Iâ€™ll test myself
Sounds pretty intense. I would recommend filling your time with things other than just classes though, that can get lonely
i swear its discords fault tho
grad school only matters for grades right?
First attempt, not bad
My life at case:
- I take 15-17 credits a semester 
- executive in my fraternity 
- one musical ensemble 
- one honor society 
- one DnD campaign 
- core for HvZ 
- job where I work 3-5 hour shifts when I have time (usually every couple weeks) 
- one or two other club meetings per week
Premeds and prelaws want higher gpas though, usually as close to 4.0 as possible
Your college gpa will probably be lower than your high school one
damn
I don't think I know anyone who still has a 4.0 in my year
Nope
For better or for worse
You don't get to console yourself with a B+, but you also don't get dinged by a B-
i guess thatâ€™s fair
I haven't ever had a professor who won't give an A for a 90%, but some have larger bounds
fo you guys have note taking recommendations? im trying to figure out if i should get notability and rely on my computer or use paper
Intro physics is curved, some higher level courses may also be curved. Chem 111 usually has a marginal curve, eg. 88% = A. But I don't think higher level chem courses are very lenient. Many math professors have various policies that make it easier to get good scores, but they're all different
Some examples of math professor grading policies: 
- dropping a low homework, a low quiz, and half of your lower midterm 
- replacing a low midterm score with your final exam grade if it's higher 
- letting you take a copy of the exam from class home and rewrite it for up to half the points you missed back 
- redoing a quiz for the opportunity of getting up to half of the points you missed back
All of these have happened in classes I've taken at case btw
i wish i had that for physics lol
I would recommend taking upper level math courses with her for the math majors in the chat
If you're not a math major I won't say you shouldn't take high level math courses, but you might have a bad time 😭
What I would say about high level math classes is that they build character
My mom shuts down the possibility of me getting the discover student card
I feel like I should have a credit card now considering there's a chance of me buying things that actually require credit
denied me cause they need a â€œdateâ€ on the acceptance letter 🗿
It's good to have a credit card and start building up credit. Just never spend more money than you have
Get into 1000 dollars of credit card debt if you want, no one can stop you
That id obviously be able to pay back
Are dining halls and stuff all closed on the weekends
I never even considered that
dining halls arent closed on the weekends
most other restaurants scattered around campus like those in tink are closed though
nah that won't be necessary~
A little bit of arson never hurt nobody
Not, but some of them have more limited hours. Also, they do close during breaks
I could be wrong on how involved Saturday is, but honestly, I don't remember
Itâ€™s a week but other than the modules you have to do nothing is really â€œmandatoryâ€
The class definitely gave me a good amount of stress, but it turned out okay in the end
It was made worse considering I was taking linear algebra at the same time, which is also a challenging and sometimes stressful class
The exams he writes are also not that bad, but they're different from what you usually get in physics 1/2
Covaults exam writing is omnipresent in physics 121 and 122
i was in 123 so martens goofed off on the exams mostly
so im not like super used to covault exams
I think I got an 82% or something on the midterm and I was a bit worried until in class he said something to the effect of "we haven't decided the grading bounds for the course, but if you got an 80% on that exam you're definitely in A territory. Also we're going to have a special class meeting to help people who got 35% of the points or less on any of the questions on the exam"
idk man im discovering im perhaps not as physics inclined as i thought i was 💀 my hopes rest in astr 221 i really need to like that class
true! and i swear i know like half the class taking it with me
Well worst case scenario . . . You can always become an English major
So senior engineering majors go "oh, shit I need another tech elective, what can I take that's not too high level and that I have the pre-reqs for" and end up in physics 221
It seems to be
I don't think it used to be though
They did say they were working on it this week but that doesn't necessarily mean they would finish this week
New laptop came [HP Zbook Firefly G8](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Firefly-G8-Workstation-i7-1165G7/dp/B08WPNLYGG/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=2CZFGAEAQ105P&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iyzIQweSeyzY8WbfVYRA4Fy7PXrYvmL1J-1bTn6UjnUjmfcsyB0PLRulgM5agApXJ11caS9E4aa4LR-Y6cslfhl8CJ3mRzyDxO3NZ6AoT6AWaD0qlT4fV8UiFr6IllBkhC2jRGfVQsDZxCYXmJ-48IuhIr_1gVcOfjMgl1dmb8mX7UNikdR_Jy0tvVWRI26NJ0SEU3Mppp5dQlrd-Kl6zA.lDaIKZQtavxemhZMrvQytrO4J3iYk-xWDe4qjP54XaE&dib_tag=se&keywords=HP+ZBook+Firefly+15+G8&qid=1720031942&sprefix=hp+zbook+firefly+15+g8%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-3)
question - do teachers give many paper handouts or is it mostly digital? In highschool for me having a binder for every class was a must but idk if college is the same
I got a binder bc I thought I would need it and I never used it
Never really needed a whole binder
yeah folders can be useful - binders are a little much tho
i just used a single folder - i barely got any handouts so it wasn't a big deal to have hand outs from different classes
if it helps for context im taking ENGR 145, MUTH 101, MATH 122, and PHYS 122
I'm just weird about color coding all mine
u will need a binder for muth
ill probably miss something but then i can buy it at case
the big thing is u want to have a windows computer
idk if 122 or 145 needs one of those carbon copy lab notebooks
But now all my shit are on my laptop
122 does I think 145 no (it doesn't have a lab)
Don't go to school kids you'll end up being depressed as hell when it comes time to apply for jobs:Sadge:
the thing is at college as long as you are getting the work done most professors don't care about how you get it done, how you take notes, how you study, etc.
Some professors are old school and wonâ€™t let you use a laptop to take notes
Lowkey I wanna pull up to a class one day with a pc, monitor and get the whole thing set up with rgb keyboards and everything
One acceptance at least. But ouch
Love him or hate him Gilmore the 🐐
ive seen people go 0/400 so this honestly doesnt seem too bad 😭
Job market hell
idk if it will be better when i graduate but theres a chance its worse too
Another reason why cancer microbiome research is a hoax (follow up/conclusion from an earlier manuscript months ago countering the original data analysis)
or rockwell really likes cwru
i cant tell
if you know your stuff you can skip 2 semesters but if you do really bad all it means is you have to take a slightly more intensive 101
you don't get set back
it wasn't hard at all when i took it
And nothing else
how bad is really bad
oh tru
hey this is probably a stupid question but where are the minor medical release & student privacy notice forms? i can't find them for some reason 💀 or do they just automatically get marked as complete?
yeah i'm on the site! but when i click the medical clearance tab there isnt anything to download (at least i think) & the consent forms tab says there aren't any forms to sign?
itâ€™s hard for me to see bc i did this like 3 years ago
apparently also you do it every year but i have no recollection of this 💀
thatâ€™s so weird bc i donâ€™t have that
i tried my best 😭
bro idk 😭
the real answer is likely that I don't have any
These are computer and software skills that may be relevant
Lol. I think one of the training things they have us do for Greek life hasn't updated the link to the rules we're being tested on because the page it links to is defunct
tips on cold emailing professors?
Reference a specific paper from the professor that they wrote - show that you read their shit and arenâ€™t sending them a form letter
tbh you donâ€™t even need to do that.. just read their research bios and talk about your interest in that type of research
yeah profs expect applications so you dont need to personalize all of them. I will say that it wont ever hurt you. Ive never had to do the mass cold emailing method, so Sam is right in a way. Now is better than later, its not like youre forced to stay in the lab if you get too busy
The real difficulty is getting into a good lab that youre interested in that also advances your standing. There's no point in staying or even getting in a lab you dont care for or doing menial work that doesnt improve your understanding of scientific techniques or knowledge. So make sure to get in a lab you are confident that you can fully commit to, and if not thats okay, but its better to not waste time you could spend enriching the rest of your academic or just personal wellbeing
also, please consult or ask to talk to the other undergrads/PhDs or tour before officially joining. You dont want to end up on a sinking ship or in a lab with no support system (aka two PIs and a couple undergrads)
it also depends when youâ€™re sending your emails. i got into my lab bc an undergrad had just graduated and i was emailing right before the semester started. it is most definitely about timing more than anything else, bc PIs will often reject undergrads not because they donâ€™t know anything (bc most undergrads donâ€™t know anything) but because they donâ€™t have space in their lab for them
Is lab work paid?
i also thought working at the cleveland clinic would be annoying bc of the distance but itâ€™s actually not that bad
are there higher odds of summer lab work being payed? im in my third summer at my current internship and its made me miserable every time so itd be nice to work under a prof at case next summer, but i cant justify doing that if i wont get paid
how hard is it to get source funding?
in my experience, not terribly hard
Cause I have soo much to do at a career fair
Good to clean up your room if you eat in your room. And just end of semester
Nothing else
if you donâ€™t live in clarke, bring a swiffer
storrs doesnt
In my experience in dorms, there are vacuums but all the dorms borrow them from each other so theres a 50/50 chance of finding one idk if case is like that
why is the '27 server so dead
More than that, it tends to die down once people start giving out numbers and you get onto the campus-exclusive chat services
They met people IRL and stopped needing a discord server
These servers mostly help y'all with the transitional period between high school and college, they aren't as useful once you actually have an advisor, friends in your major or just at the school, and other resources
i donâ€™t need to be talking to people i barely know
you should see â€˜24â€¦ all the activity is just people leaving
i am graduating in 4 years, but iâ€™ve also failed no classes, never changed my major or took a semester off of classes
is source funding for people with financial need or is it merit/project based
The FAFSA grants can last up to 12 semesters, but your cwru university grants or scholarships will only last for 8
More or less. If you're not getting aid for a semester, it doesn't count towards the total
It would be pretty hard to get hired before then. I think co-ops are a school of engineering thing tho
I want to do co ops for moneys sake
Nope, they're good for making some money back and potentially connecting to a company before graduation who might offer you a job, but they're not mandatory
is there any reason you wouldnt want to?
If you want to finish in 4 years
If there's classes you need to take only offered in particular semesters that you would miss due to co-op
Not being able to find a co-op in a career field you want to pursue
Oh yikes
Because there was a specific class he needed to take that he didn't have room for after the co-op
it seems like it
Yeah unfortunately I don't think you'll be able to help that
this is why i am hesitant to make a 4yr plan without an advisor cause there's stuff like that that's really difficult to find and figure out
I haven't even stepped on campus yet
just home games, with the exception of the Carnegie Mellon game, which we will likely travel for if it is away (we did last year and Dr. Helton (marching band director and music ed faculty) expressed that he wanted to make that a regular thing, where the opposite band travels) but we're at home for that game this year
TL;DR no away travel this year, likely away travel next year for the CMU game only
if you want you can dm me with the things you want to do and i can try to make it work for you or let you know the easiest way to approach it
might not get back to you immediately though because i am working full time this summer
i spent probably over 40 hours my freshman year trying to make it work so i know a decent amount about how to make it work
Omg long distance?
i dont recommend
this is what i get for dating someone in a different year from me
i have been with this man for my entire 20s thus far...
Aw
no plans are planned rn bc he just just started work this week
Poor him
bro is working 12 hour days 😭
Yeah I am but I didnâ€™t know they required that
i think i was studying
i donâ€™t wanna dox him
in my head I kinda didn't expect you two to be dating
bc my friend found out that my adam was the adam he knew and he lost his mind
I know a different CWRU EE alumni Adam who just left that company after 10 months there to move to Qualcomm. The days must be brutal. 

And he had been really excited to work there too 

He was at their Seattle office, not Texas, and was doing more embedded type stuff rather then high power.
he doesnâ€™t plan to stay there long term. end plan for both of us is boston/east coast
bf adam grew up on the west coast, but his parents grew up east coast and heâ€™s spent a lot of time on the east coast as a result. and guess what. wants to move to the east coast
damn nice
Couldnâ€™t say no to no debt
i donâ€™t intend to stay here for grad school but i do appreciate the time i have spent here
Iâ€™ve been there a few times, I donâ€™t think i want to live there
if i didnâ€™t go here for undergrad i would probably want to go to grad school here
i feel the same way about my home
tho providence is based (iâ€™m not from providence, im from a suburb)
For realsies though I will probably end up living on the west or east coast, and more likely east
will never back down from my providence has better food than boston claims
i want 🟫 so i can live at home for a couple years and pay off my loans
I still have one more year before the grad school stress must begin
(Doesnâ€™t mean it didnâ€™t start last year anyway)
Rip
itâ€™s ok tho because i did a skeleton of my cv and i feel like i look way better on paper than i feel
Missed opportunity for them 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
@eekhannah when were you able to first get research
i started at the beginning of my junior year. tho i wish i started sophomore year but it is what it is
mainly bc i couldnâ€™t afford to not be paid
bc your schedule as an underclassman is a lot more concrete and thereâ€™s less time for research. so the little space i did have i needed to work
It's never too late?
i feel like its not very hard to do better than the emoji movie
i know so many ppl that were able to get research before they even got onto campus as a freshman and it's stresing me out lMAO
i didnâ€™t start in the specific lab iâ€™m in rn until february and itâ€™s going so well so
and like. if i had started research earlier i wouldnâ€™t be in the specific lab iâ€™m in rn and i really like that i am in this lab and itâ€™s been really good for me. the lab i was in before wasnâ€™t as good. sometimes waiting is actually really good 🙏
And like. hereâ€™s the thing. if someone is willing to take a freshman in with no college lab class experience and not much knowledge about the subject. itâ€™s probably 🚩 anyway
covault in the physics department says hed rather take a freshman than a senior bc hell have to teach them what they need to know for the lab anyway and a freshman can stick around in the lab knowing what to do for much longer than a senior could
thats fair
most pis donâ€™t want to take seniors
with neuro itâ€™s fairly competitive rn bc itâ€™s very new as a major and yet itâ€™s the largest major in CAS and weâ€™re all required to do research
but biology BAs (most bio majors) arenâ€™t required to do research
they report ba and bs combined for majors that offer both on the like enrollment by major thing (afaik) so i didnt realize theyre split otherwise
i think itâ€™s probably like 200 ba and 100 bs and neuro is just above 200 i think i donâ€™t really recall exactly
itâ€™s been months since i had this conversation
Were you able to get research as a. Freshman ?
It seems to be easiest for bio labs and physics
Research for CS is a bit harder (especially if you want research which isnâ€™t just â€œapply ML to this new problem and hope it worksâ€) and research for a very pure field like math is harder still
Or physics and bio like Adam said where there's just a ton of lab work always going on
Ouch
Yeah lmao imagine trying to get math research without having taken DiffEq or linear algebra
You'd be almost worse than useless 😭
And PURE math research without basically the entire undergrad curriculum?!
i could have if i wanted it but it was really scuffed and i was burnt out as it was so i noped out
Imagine trying to do pure math research and you don't even know analysis or abstract 😭
Tbh I don't even know if I could be adding anything to pure math research as a junior
Imagine doing college classes, work, clubs, research, all at the same time bruh
What happened during your summer work?
Wish you luck
really
yeah that was my last semester + a relationship
did you work in a field neuro related
technically i had two jobs last semester bc i was getting paid for research
and my other job was an office assistant in the undergraduate research office
Bro was so busy last semester
mine was getting interviewed by all these news outlets over his capstone
But yeah having a social life, including platonic and romantic relationships, can be a major time sink you don't necessarily expect coming to college
honestly tho like
i also was only taking 14 credits last semester
next semester: doing 18 while being an RA, research (3 of the credits are research, iâ€™m probably going to work 9 hours on top of that), club exec, ldr, applying to grad school next year
compared to someone not in a relationship
Stupid boyfriends
Romance is a distraction from the Tao, we must remain committed only to its study
You study the Tao by living your life
itâ€™s okay at least my sorority is dead
lowkey that was my biggest time commitment and my semester got way easier when it died
Hopefully no more chapters are going to slip away in the next few years, but you never know
This Ha. Is full of pain
someone got a bid from us and tri sig 20 minutes apart
just donâ€™t form a local chapter 😭
cwru hates local chapters
i donâ€™t think any of us will
yeah no that won't happen
i could be wrong but thatâ€™s what i was told
Because that's how you don't get sanctioned
Considering the pattern of the last couple decades
fraternities/sororities with premeds/bio majors would fucking hate that
Sorry I mean 72 hour rush right into being initiated
3 weeks is enough of a test
Seriously though CWRU better not make rush any longer 😭
Is it still separate from rush?
Definitely not my cup of tea but they seem to have no problems with recruiting
Well sure but then you canâ€™t vet your new class
Idk, I think that larger chapters have a very different mindset towards recruitment and brotherhood
It's hard to tell if that's because they are large chapters, or if they're large because of those attitudes though
Like every day I wake up and don't haze anyone
Don't even have to try
We get a free mini fridge wtf
My mom already bought a mini fridge and a microwave for me for my summer college program last year but ig she can sell it or something
On second thought considering it's every *room* and I probably won't have a room to myself
Should still bring my own just in case cause I might need all of the space
My mom plans on buying me like frozen meals every week and considering that's prob gonna be like idk 3-4 of them at the least
I'm not trying to take ALL of the freezer space from said roommate
The plan was to make it for late nights and early mornings since I probably won't be eating breakfast
And I tend to eat after dining halls would likely be closed
Though idk what their hours are
Don't you gotta pay for those
you donâ€™t know the power of the den swipe just yet
I still don't have my housing
They said they were working on GIH like July 1st
The den (which is on the meal plan) is open until 2 am, spartieque (also meal plan) open until midnight and leutner late night is open to 11 or 12 (I canâ€™t remember - but itâ€™s on the meal plan)
There was a while where I used both my den swipes like every single day for a couple of weeks straight
FML
I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying this but I wish I had Ohio weather rn
I ate at the den a lot in freshman year and literally haven't eaten there since
i actually lost weight freshman year
i, and most people i know, got sick of the den rather quick
except roommate who ate the den quite literally every single day
I think it was bc I never ate breakfast
Leutner powdered eggs and sausgae just didn't do it for me after like the first month
their breakfast potatoes were fire tho
i have gained weight since college but freshman year has nothing to do with that
The funniest part of any given year is the first day it gets below 40 and the Den is completely empty bcause the freshmen are scared to go outside
the turkey blt (i would get it without turkey and without bacon) wasnâ€™t too bad
i miss the den beyond burger
i would just never get up early enough tbh. i still donâ€™t. i havenâ€™t eaten breakfast in weeks
did get tacos at my lab meeting today tho 🔥🔥
im just a hungry fella i ate breakfast
iâ€™m very bad at waking up in the morning
oh same but ill be tired no matter what so id rather not be tired and hungry
but i donâ€™t get up early enough
thats fair tho
how bad is an 8 am lab
a lot of people have a harder time getting up in the morning in college than they did before, so if you do okay getting up early but it kinda sucks, it may well become really difficult in college
i used to wake up every day for high school at 6am and now i struggle to get out of bed at 7:45
You dont have to answer this question but you didnt live in clarke did u?
My weight was basically the same throughout freshman year, probably because I only ate what I directly required for survival
i feel like i didnâ€™t look my age until recently
I still look like a 16 year old and Iâ€™m almost twenty 😭
I am 20 and a woman at the deli asked what kind of meat my mom wanted and assumed I was like 15
It hurt my ego a little bit
But I was also dressed very lazily (ie. Like a high school buy) so I'm not too mad
It's extra hard if you're short
Iâ€™m not even short I guess I just have a youthful face
Idk, young adults don't actually look that different from old teenagers
I was sitting at dinner with strangers and one of them almost mentioned some inappropriate topic and another one stopped her and said â€œwe have a PG rated audience hereâ€
â€¦ I am halfway through college not middle school
like bro i stopped growing when i was 16
my height has nothing to do with my age at this point
but itâ€™s less severe as a short woman vs a short man
I actually grew a little bit around the end/a bit after high school I'm just still very short
itâ€™s not too short but iâ€™m often the shortest person in a room
It was at cleveland state (where i took it) i think they just put it in wrong
I thought about it but it doesnt fit in my schedule unless i get into the full class but then id have 4 classes in a row and no time for lunch 😭
I'm mostly messing around, you probably shouldn't jump into 300 level math classes in your first semester
I mean theres also only one non-300 level class for me to take so taking a 300 level wouldnâ€™t be too crazy
If you can get into number theory that's a relatively straightforward 300 level math class that doesn't really do proofs tho
avalon says this is a bad idea
I've always wondered. What do they actually teach in discrete math?
its kind of a broad overview of discrete math
Not really
Discrete is also more for cs majors, though number theory is probably the most cs-ish math class that isn't already listed as a mandatory or optional part of the cs degree
yeah its basically an overview of math concepts you might find useful for cs
âœ¨ My first semester as a math major at CWRU! âœ¨
MATH 224 â¤ï¸
MATH 304 🙄
MATH 307 😊
MATH 308 🥰
MATH 321 â˜ºï¸
although i don't remember it really saying why they would be useful
only now through self study i'm like "ah i can use this property"
And MATH 401, MATH 528, MATH 666, MATH 1,570 and MATH 3,411,073
You don't have to solve that
Tbh I don't even want to solve that
Not necessarily what they are tho
Idk I recommend number theory to people who like arithmetic shenanigans. Mixed reviews for cs majors (Avalon hated it)
In all seriousness Alex it's nice to finish DiffEq freshman year because it puts you ahead of the average math major and gives you a ton of freedom in how you design your math major experience
To be fair though, Avalon also liked quantum computing despite hating both math and physics so I do not know what to make of his course reviews
Despite being both math majors in the same start semester the only class me and Adam ever took together was calc 3
Or, would you consider taking either 361 or 462 senior year
Lol we'll see, I think I'm more interested in taking math modelling and some more stats in senior year
As a math and CS major?
Charlie I also hate stats
Useful doesnt mean fun
But it'll be useful for the angle I'm trying to take for grad school
Do you think one becomes a pure math major for excitement of its uses?
I am a pure math major 😭
Awww no Ben Koeppen MATH 380 arc? \:-(
and i can't get into any of the other cs classes that are open because of vocal ped
still can't believe info theory is full
i realized info theory would actually be useful while working my job but now it is far too late
plus i don't have 380
Neither do I and yet we ball
The hard part of majors that don't gel well
I can't take bio or chem lab this semester because of my geology lab and how my analysis section is locked in by the geology lab
its 1:00-3:45 on tuesdays its just this class specifically being goofy
Also couldn't manage to get into stat 312 next semester due to all the conflicts (and all the seniors taking it smh)
yeah most cs classes i want to take are tuesday thursday for some reason
no i hate this so much, why is every class i wanna take at this time
is stellic working for anyone else?
Were you always cs and math or is the math new
So fair dude
What math are you taking next semester?
303 and 308, gonna test out of 224 hopefully but if i cant be bothered to study it this next month i might take that too
i still havent taken phys122 cuz i keep telling myself ill test out after studying over breaks but i never do, and i really dont wanna take the class cuz i hated 121 lab so much and ive heard 122 lab is so much worse
Itâ€™s closed to upperclassmen changing schedules until Jul 20
oh
Idk 122 lab is similarly ass to 121
is stat 312 always so hard to get into
Well, it's not necessarily that hard to get into the class theoretically. But it's hard to get a good professor for the class because half of them suck
And all of the seniors take as many of those sections as they can, leaving scraps for the juniors, leaving basically nothing for underclassmen
unfortunately its the threshold for a two course sequence i need for my minor
Your other option is to just take the class with a worse prof
some of them are bad, some of them are okay, and then thereâ€™s song âœ¨💗💞💗âœ¨
iâ€™d help but iâ€™ve taken it already
i heard nandy isnâ€™t bad
heâ€™s a little tough but heâ€™s not a bad prof
i have never touched r so yeah thats probably relevant
i mean you donâ€™t really need any established knowledge
312 and 312R are the same class
The lighting situation looks kinda shit though might need to buy a lamp
Iâ€™ve never seen that
I was on 1st floor so I never experienced communal bathroom
i had wall to wall windows on both outside walls last sem 😭
WTF omg
My room is right next to a bathroom so I hope it doesnâ€™t wake me up at night
Yeah thatâ€™s odd u canâ€™t use the bathroom if someone is showering
Iâ€™m so jealous
omg
I do not want to hand wash every dish every time I use it
iâ€™m so sad bc iâ€™m moving to stj in 3 weeks
I feel so pampered having a dishwasher I donâ€™t want it to go away
itâ€™s ok stj is newer and less broken
it just doesnâ€™t have a dishwasher
4th floor kinda sucks
Wtf
Unfortunately
The RA dorms arenâ€™t accessible so 😭
I won $15k in scholarships in the past month and I still have to take out maximum federal loans and a $2k private loan
damn
my tuition and housing/meal plans is covered by scholarships grants and federal loans
mine is scary
Their eyes are so stupid
my mom isnt going to graduate college until next year? i think which should mean im fine until atleast my junior year
me when cwru wants me to pay more next semester than i have for my past 3 YEARS COMBINED
â€œYour parents are contributing $0 and you have $200k+ in medical bills? Sorry idc it says on paper they can pay $50k so ur gonna take out 50k in loans urself even though u canâ€™t get a job due to disabilityâ€
still mad
convinced thatâ€™s what killed sig psi (as someone who experienced the decision to end the chapter)
fucker hates Greek life wants all of southside housing gone
everyone asking about which dorm is good or bad as if there's really that much of a difference they're all shit :PU_PepeLMAO:
the building itself is. adequate and it was super chaotic last year but thatll obviously change year to year
should be they didnt specifically mention gih but it is cutler
iâ€™m fighting with housing because my parents just came off of 15 years of poverty and you cannot recover from that in 2 years iâ€™m sorry
iâ€™m appealing regardless cause bruh
they said $200k medical bills isnâ€™t a good enough reason to not be able to pay $50k/yr for college like u have to be joking
bc they sold an asset in 2022 but the money in the sale was used to pay off the asset
They have some stupid calculator and if the calculator doesnâ€™t say u get an aid increase theyâ€™re like sorry!
It's kind of messed up tbh. How hard it is to get good financial aid and how easy it is to lose it
Now Iâ€™m wondering if theyâ€™re gonna expect my parents to pay $100k theoretically for college this yr
Bc I have a sibling in college now
i think they stopped considering it with the new fafsa
In theory your efc should be lower if you have another sibling in college
Nope
It doesnâ€™t consider that anhmore
It may still be regarded with the css profile
Yeah they said css considers it still
1st floor was shit it was always so loud
Instead of being in the common room like a normal person people wanted to stand right outside my door at night 😭
Sometimes I would open the door and they would be leaning on my door
Itâ€™s bc itâ€™s close to the elevator
Unfortunately I don't have any photos of the Rick astley pride wall
so its a double room but theres nobody else in it
wish i didnt get a roommate
yea just wondering how its gonna work for like
so i was wondering whats gonna happen to that extra 200
I got used to having my own bathroom and then they put someone on the other side of my jack and Jill and I hated it so much
I don't have the exact experience, but I changed over to a cheaper meal plan and I don't think my aid got cut? I'm not entitled certain. Maybe worth emailing financial aid again to ask, or just compare the estimation with the actual bill you get
It's possible your roommate hasn't been assigned yet
I think that gih might work kinda weird with the pace of the assignments
Me and the boys got too many mini fridges in our basement and now we can't get rid of them though 😭 bad timing case housing
eBay sell them I guess
I was going to leave them for the freshmen but if they don't need them I'd love one
Is there any real benefit to taking math and cs as a BS over a BA?
Which ones do you want as a BS and which as a BA
I mean id probably do both BS or both BA, because sure the CS BA requires less courses so it could be smart to do that with a math BS but I donâ€™t want to be lacking on CS skills either
Don't do both BS imo
Well it sort of depends what you want to do with the CS degree
The standard for math and CS majors is usually cs BS and math BA (though of course there are many exceptions)
Math BS literally requires 3 more electives, and thatâ€™s about it as far as I know
Just because a cs BS will cover most classes needed to get a math BA
Iâ€™m taking so many random math classes as is that I think Iâ€™m done with the elective requirements next semester 😭
I still have 4 or 5 or so math electives to chew through in the next two years
I've completed 48 credits towards my math degree out of 69
Which means I need about 7 more classes total
Especially since I was a little late on that train
Funny math class \:-)
I have 37 credits left for my geology degree. That adds up to 58 credits between my two degrees, which requires some heavier semesters to also finish up my breadth requirements :'(
How funny of a math class?
If I do some shenanigans with this though, it goes down by a few classes due to some cheeky double counting
It requires some strategic work though lol. I basically can't take any classes that are not contributing to my graduation anymore
MATH 467 (differentiable manifolds)
THIS. Is how funny of a math class
Lmao I feel like you just have to go beg the math department really hard
He's probably not going to still be at case by 2040 tho
Did it somehow fill without you
Did the big bad cs major hurt you
(Last offered Spring 2019 or 2020)
I did not fill without me and I will be in it but Charlie asked for a funny math class and so I had to find one on par
Fair enough
I could also probably do both BAs and graduate in 3 years but no point to when i can just stay a 4th year and have another year of free food and housing while taking more silly math classes
I mean i already have 18 without even starting so id only need 17 credits per semester
Fair enough
But that wouldn't necessarily apply to math or physics for example
ive 100% complained about this before but im so mad astro doesnt offer a bs/ms
Unsolicited rant time: I just got a denial email for math 227, expecting one for phys 123. It's not that I expected to get in, but I don't understand how I didn't meet the requirements. The email was crazy vague and of course all of the people that I've emailed don't answer anything
I wonder if they didn't have space and selected randomly?
There isn't really a big difference between 223 and 227 besides the professors, and that can go either way
He's alright with emails, but idk how he is over the summer
Because if you didn't, unfortunately they may be changing things to make the requisites more hard-line
Okay then absolutely ask him, probably during discovery week if he doesn't respond to anything
Send an email to Zhao saying that you met the requirement of getting a 5 on BC and you aren't sure why you haven't been granted permission to take 227
I already did, about an hour ago
I'm more confused than mad, I just want to know why
I need to remind myself that either way, it'll work out and I'll be fine
No, Michael. If a physics grad school ***EVER*** sees that you took one Calc III instead of another four years ago, they will instantly reject you
Starting to generate the same replies
Well I don't even know if I could do that, what if I have to work with numbers?
Go work in the physics mines
And mine in 224 was worse than both of those probably
Horn was pretty bad for Adam
Im happy i wont be
I didn't know what to say because I didn't have him
He is an old, incredibly brilliant man who understands things in his own way and is generally unwilling to admit that he is wrong or that there are alternative methods to do things. His lectures can be very rough, and his homeworks are inconsistent. Tests pretty much revolve around looking at past tests and following the same ideas. He is unclear with what you should and should not memorize/know by heart, and he handwaves away a LOT of algebra as he lectures, but you are expected to know that algebra on the tests. Heâ€™s also somewhat of a jerk, although I do believe he really cares about his work and his teaching
I would not recommend him as a professor, but if you do get him, you will feel a sense of camaraderie as the entire class bands together to figure out what the fuck is going on
Id probably go crazy if my first math class at case was like that
oh nicee
I think CWRU is a school in Cuyahoga county ... have you heard of it before
Never heard of such a place
It's this trade school in rural Ohio
I will be working in the math mines
There's an entire deposit of integrals under these hills and they won't come out themselves
A lot of work
Math lung
The worst affliction
As it gets worse, random groups, matrices, differential forms, and entire equations will start spewing
woah you should see a doctor (a math one, obviously), once it gets to the topology stage it's fatal
Yeah I've been sneezing out determinant calculations for 5x5 matrices lately. I think there's something dastardly growing in my lungs
It's like that flower lung thing but for math majors
Isnâ€™t that not possible
I donâ€™t know how you could ever do that
Lemme guess? Thereâ€™s worse?
Only the math majors go down there with ancient tomes and torches
Dr. Meckes has taken the matrices and tamed them and will gladly teach you his secrets
Oh lordy
I think the deepest level of the math mines contain ||categories||
I havenâ€™t seen a tensor in the wild yet Iâ€™m a bit nervous
they'll shear you to death
Deep inside the math mines are the octonion transformations
I called someone a nerd once as a joke and someone else who overheard said "Damn! When **Adam Hutchings** calls you a nerd you have hit rock bottom"
Infinitely auditing the class if you will
fuck now iâ€™m gonna have it stuck in my head 😭
Itâ€™s already stuck in my head. Abstract is going to be a nightmare if every time I hear the word finite group my brain autofills
the word finite is enough unfortunately
But I guess spherical is probably more intuitive relatively speaking
HOLY SHIT Charlie we said the same thing at the same time *again*
Math majors calling spherical geometry "more intuitive" while everyone else looks on in horror
Everything you say makes me need to take More Math Classes
bro i canâ€™t even intuit a single variable integral
I feel that part of the reason I liked PHYS 124 as much as I did is because I could visualize all of the vectors and stuff in my head
MATH 401 / MATH 361 / MATH 423 junior year not clickbait?
me crying in still didn't get in to 124
Oh A is linearly independent but it doesn't form a basis
Thatâ€™s fair. A and D are correct
More ideas:
Fermat's last theorem, Riemann hypothesis, modulo arithmetic, lattice bases, 1729 and the sum of three cubes problem, platonic solids, Archimedean solids, the "14th Archimedean solid," Johnson solids, kepler poinsot solids, wang tiles, tiling the plane, tiling the sphere, tessellations, Schlegel diagrams, and the hebesphenomegacorona (very funny Johnson solid)
Sorry let me sort these for you lol
I'm just remembering topics from the math classes I have specifically taken
Layer 2: Fermat's last theorem, platonic solids, modulo arithmetic 
Layer 3: Archimedean solids, tiling the plane, tessellations 
Layer 4: Kepler poinsot solids, the "14th Archimedean solid," 1729 and sum of three cubes problem, tiling the sphere, wang tiles
Layer 5: schlegel diagrams, Riemann hypothesis 
Layer 6: hebesphenomegacorona, lattice bases
I'm too deep in the math major to remember what normal people know
@cygnusxxii you're normal-ish in math nerd ness how many of these have you heard of
Oooo math club
fermats last theorem
donâ€™t know what it is but i have heard of it
I really am in too deep
Youâ€™ve just reached another plane of existence
I don't think I'm in that deep but I've heard of like six of those and of those know maybe four of them beyond name
Platonic solids, tiling the plane, tessellations, wang tiles, hebesphunomegacorona (only recognize the name, idk what it actually is)
How does this even happen
They likely sent the bill without a bunch of aid applied, it happened to me going into my sophomore year, I emailed them and they basically said that I shouldn't have emailed them about it because it sometimes happen but that they will always apply the aid before the bill is actually due. 
And then like a week later they applied the aid and sent an updated bill that was correct
"shouldn't have emailed them" then they should've made that known what 😭
y'all it ain't that serious 😭
This has real â€œyouâ€™re studying computer science right? Can you fix my computer?â€ energy
You want to know something
Math senior capstone: so we made a polytope
yeah because it will have a messy codebase, not scale, and will never be maintained
and there's so much on there and there's probably some kind of lockin
i'm pretty sure oracle makes money off of people who bought into oracle and can't get out
PSA(?) since there isn't like a most appropriate channel for this but since y'all so concerned with scheduling and future planning I'm gonna drop my resume template here, just download it and fill it out with your own stuff, I've seen too many shitty resumes (esp 1st and 2nd years) from college students it's appalling
which needs everything i have ever done
you put a section when you want a section
because it shows ive been working even if its not relevant
I mean it is better for showing your personality I guess but at the end of the day itâ€™s still doesnâ€™t beat just talking to the recruiter in person or hitting them up on LinkedIn or just be a nepo baby
no recruiter will want to look at a CV
i need it for grad school
i cant afford to do a masters but i recognize i would be able tohave a decent career after a masters
big reason why i am doing nothing in healthcare also
The grind never stops I fear😔
Respect tho
i would be applying to pharmacy school rn if i could afford it just bc it takes less time
Honestly itâ€™s been so exhausting Iâ€™m actually looking forward to school starting bc this semester I donâ€™t have to work and do classes😭
Like so far my 2024 has been awful
2024 is by far the worst year of my 21 years on earth
Like no joke it is god awful
does anyone know who's the professor for math 227?
I know Orendain is teaching one section but idk about the other two
I had Orendain for MATH 308 (abstract algebra) not Calc III, but I can say that in his class learning often needs to be more self-motivated. He gave out quizzes which were 4 problems from a set of 20-30 problems that you knew in advance, but the problems were often hard enough that people could spend 5-10 hours on them per week
I havenâ€™t taken a class with orendain (although I will this sem), but I have talked with him and heâ€™s a super nice guy
is anyone's single sign on not working rn
it keeps telling me that I have invalid credentials but I used the same sign in?
Yeah same I've been trying since this morning and it's still not working
I think it's still under maintenance or smth
Oh it *is* broken for me too. Wack.
I wouldn't be too worried about it, I doubt it'll be that long.
Dobrosotskaya tends to lecture pretty fast, but also very thoroughly. She's super nice and usually has a reasonably lenient grading policy, but she also writes pretty challenging homework and tests. She usually also allows a sheet of handwritten notes on tests. She also gives quizzes that are usually not open note. I've also only taken 300-level math classes with her, but she used pretty similar policies for both of them. I took math 224 with Zhao and she is similarly a fast and thorough lecturer. She did weekly quizzes instead of homework (I think there was optional HW but I didn't do it), but that may have changed. Her exams were reasonably challenging and she did not allow any notes or formula sheets. She had a somewhat lenient grading policy, but not as lenient as Julia's
it was broken for me yesterday and it was working this morning
Notably important to contact your roommate before you get to the college
My opinion though
i dont think mine exists on socials
that would be useful Imma dig though my notfis now
in terms of getting to class
and I guess hypothermia
Most intense beginning of spring semester but even that is not that much
not as bad then
Youâ€™re not a math major, I am
I'm still allowed to use logic
Ok fair enough have fun
Bro is going body without organs mode
MATH 308 reference??
Tho I wanna get into phenomenology eventually
I try my best to stick to that too and not get ahead of myself, I do feel cocky after finishing a harder class like calc 2 or self studying an ap, but I make sure to intimidate myself by trying a problem from the course ahead with no context and feel stupid but eager again
It's a good feeling imo
My advice: don't get cocky after AP classes
AP classes are mostly intro freshman courses stretched out over an entire year of high school instruction, they aren't meaningless, but you're going to far surpass the level APs can provide in just your freshman year
yeah no I think upcoming class content looks impossible to understand at a glance, I'm scared scared, I
College is a time for growth, change, and exploration. Don't set yourself on knowing who you are and what you want right now, but I assure that you will figure it out
its helpful to know what you want to major in early on tho
The major you applied as doesn't mean anything
It's kind of weird to explain, but I would say that the self directed nature of college classes make them a very different experience. You're going to cover material that's much more challenging than you learned in high school, but the growth in your skill set for dealing with them will also rapidly increase (if you put in the work). Don't be afraid that the classes are too hard and you won't be able to handle it, your professors want you to succeed and there will always be help available for those who seek it
Yeah the major you applied with doesn't mean much
You don't enter with a declared major
You're not even able to declare a major until (traditionally) November
wth this school is goated
I didn't declare my major until february of freshman year, and still haven't declared what I put on my common app
damn
3 seems like alot to me but I guess that might be me too
can you do the latter without a w
Mentally I went from civil engineering (what I put on my application) to mechanical engineering (from admitted students weekend through first semester) to applied math (declared second semester) to math ba + env geology ba (second semester sophomore) to math bs + env geology ba (this summer)
I also have a withdrawal and it hasn't come back to bite me yet
Tbh having a W or two isn't a big deal
I mean it hasn't hurt you yet right
Classes I've dropped:
- PE class because it was on north side 
- PE class because it was too close after my previous class
- class that was too far of a walk in between two other classes 
Classes I've added:
- glee club 
- earth history 
Class I withdrew from:
- physics 310, classical mechanics, because it was too hard and it was hurting my ability to keep up in other classes and avoid burnout
I'm probably gonna drop a class this fall, I have 5 classes plus 2 clubs and a PE
wow looks like PE seems rough without certain parameters
They say "are you sure you want to drop this class?" 
"Are you really really super sure?"
"This cannot be undone, proceed?"
Nope
Eh it's not that bad, I'm just lazy enough without having to run to my pe class
makes sense idk how hard that is in snow too
does being late to class hurt you though
Depends on the class
Some professors don't care, some will dock your grade if you do it more than twice
Most pe classes are solely graded on attendance and participation, so being late can screw you over
Apparently the coach for the fencing phed said that if you're part of the club and go to tournaments regularly, he'll be more lenient with attendance for you
I've had classes where it's no big deal to walk in 5 minutes late every day. But other classes where even a minute late gets added to a tally and enough absences or lateness can dock your grade
Please, for the love of all that is holy, read your syllabus. It tells you things like grading policies, attendance policies, late work policies, the outline for the course, books you need, exam dates, etc.
wow classes really are just the professor in the end
Idk
I don't know the history department well
But yeah it takes like 10 minutes to read a syllabus it's not that bad
yeah I don't want that to happen
I guess I'll have to start classes before I really understand what that means
never really read my hs class syllabi aside from topics and grading policy
that does seem like a benefit
Phil 101 rotates professors so I've heard crazy shit about other 101 sections with completely different curricula just bc of the different professor
especially if they've concentrated their study in those views
would be sad if your essays just had to kiss their ass
They won't come after you for expressing differing views
Provided that those views are authentic and aren't outright bigoted, ignorant, or abjectly uninformed
so just don;t be an asshole
You can disagree as much as you want, and many professors love debating
can't be that hard
Cardinal rule of all life: don't be an asshole
Nah, most professors actually hate this lol
I hope I don't get professors with little patience to freshman mistakes like calling them teacher, or raising their hand to use the restroom I probably would do tehse
They want you to make a well reasoned argument on what you believe or what you want to argue, good professors don't care if you agree with them or not
that would seem excessive
istg this guy seems like a celebrity on campus
I might never have him 😢
He teaches like 800 students every semester, so most people have taken at least one class with him
I have never even seen his face lmao
I never had Chris either but I've emailed him a decent bit because I'm a math major and in the math club and math honor society
I had some friends in first year who didn't turn 18 until late freshman year or the summer
I've known way more people who just didn't turn 18 until September or October
I don't mean to be blunt
College students of all years do the dumbest shit bro
People will do stupid and immature shit, sometimes college students are like high schoolers with a lease and the ability to get drunk
lease on a car?
There's also a degree to which doing dumb shit is acceptable, expected, productive, and good for forming bonds with people
A lot of people are living on their own for the very first time in freshman year, which means they're going to test the boundaries they were never allowed to cross
woah I realized yeah we're gonna be friends with these people for like life
It definitely happens to some extent, but for the most part people respect if you don't want to do something
understood but from what charlie says it seems not so bad
It wasn't even in DU lmao
I just don't want someone to put be in a straitjacket and make me chug a keg
Case and Ohio the state are both really serious about being anti-hazing
I wouldn't be surprised to find that some clubs or other organizations are doing some covert under the radar hazing. But in general, the really crazy stuff you hear about at like OSU doesn't happen here
(rip rmn you will be missed)
keeps us from like idk obeying old frat people
I've been in one of their gyms but nothing else
As a member of Greek life, if someone is ever trying to coerce you into something you don't want to do or do something embarrassing or demeaning just because it's "tradition," they don't have your best interest at heart and you should leave the situation and report them for hazing
Hazing is still alive and well in certain communities
Sadly Case frats don't do mensur
I'm like "damn bro I would've left at the chainsaws"
people still use cliffs notes?
I find litcharts useful
don't you like the blurbs that discuss themes in each paragraph of the summary that both act as analysis and help you see continuity
I'm trained enough to not really need the help tbh
I'm not, if I don't enhoy the reading that's all I'm using unless I find an audio book
Fair, I got lucky that most of my readings in the latter half of hs and in college were interesting
I don't know if any of the books were that lifechanging or dense but they were solid
we had to read a shakespeare play that I just wasn't having idk why, and then the book Mountains beyon Mountains is kind of why I chose to be premed
Fair enough
you seem very involved in campus activities
Lol I try, keeps me happier than if I had nothing to do
I didn't go last year, what is the format
wait I so want to play D&D but the tabletop empire server looks so dead
yeah my friends here are lame
they just scrolled in the back of class
Maritime exploration + lovecraftian bullshit was kinda the idea, but it ended early when classes began
but yeah idk what it is about a nautical vibe, I'm just so drawn to it
it really is
The discord server  is indeed very dead.
lowkey relieved that didnâ€™t continue bc my snap decision to make my character really seasick before i realized weâ€™d be on boats the whole time wouldâ€™ve shaken out quite poorly 💀
Damn I missed some good convo
TF I HAD TO GO TO SLEEP
I was busy dying of The Illness
Oh no, what The Illness do you have
idk. I've just been sick the last week. Missing work today :(((
Isn't nonconsensual bloodletting just stabbing someone???
I can fix that ;)
Depends where, limbs are kinda hard but Iâ€™d guess 2 cm
Donâ€™t try this at home kids
34 days left
But you wouldn't survive either
I need to be a legit upperclassman already
I need to get back to learning
My dad gave me a bunch of math textbooks that I have read some of
actually so sad that I can't take 100 classes a semester
i prescribe eye of toad and liver of cat
Never say never
This is my dad's math book collection
Real analysis uses I think a standard textbook which is freely available and downloadable on the internet
he had to discard down when we moved tho
Monasteries are jealous
He could just leave them unattended at case..
bad choice to give me this i am going to read it NOW
unfortunately they are in german
apparently it used to be a dorm building
Who needs sleep
meee i need sleep
i will actually cry and run to derek and be like HELP
(Someone dm me Jakeâ€™s face)
the whole jake has no idea who you are thing wouldnt work as well for you
Honestly I'm sad the math department doesn't have a freshman meetup like the CS dept does
i won't actually be moved in yet cause i move into my house the day after freshman move-in 💀
One issue with this is that there a lot of people don't come in as math majors but end up as math majors
Could also be like math major information session
I hate how accurate this is lmaooooo
So I need to look for the umbreon, the gnome, the machamp .. who else?
I asked him if I could take HDP without having normal probability and he said no 😔
i want to but i haven't taken 380 yet :(
man I'm realizing spring might be 322, 324, 380, PHYS 122, and an english class
All you need
Math major grindset
apparently i am always wearing a beige or purple hoodie
ive ditched my blue jacket that ive been told was my cartoon character uniform bc it stopped being waterproof 😔
the sophie blue jacket will be missed
Spring math classes for me will liekly include 380, 408, 424, and 425
im taking math 2 next semester
bro is in math n+1
I won't be around for move in unfortunately (I'm going home for 10 days lol), but I'll be back on campus on the 20th
Spring I'm looking to take 322 stat 312 and maybe math 408 if I can make it work
I think the math department had such a thing but it was after O-week and was with the math club, not the entire department
Can't remember
I actually do not know about the new UGER system 😔 sorry
Lol I just realized that my scheduling is extremely tight if I want to do things like "graduate on time"
Stellic seems to count CSDS 310 as a SAGES 💀
Does it work retroactively?
Seems to
Am I able to start picking classes now? I thought registration started tomorrow?
And you have an army of math majors who can look at your schedule in #course-planning
Based off if you need permissions or if there is a time conflict between potential classes
ima slowly work my way up to like 6 😭
I have one not very helpful major advisor and one incredibly helpful one who I will go into his office for a 5 min conversation and it will last an hour
Who is your math advisor
Dr. Belmont. She seems nice but a little awkward and doesnt really make conversation. Sheâ€™s definitely a genius tho
four year advisors aren't horrible but everyone else is useless until you're a student
Fair
ozguner is my cs one, i havent declared math yet cuz everyone said to wait till after course registration cuz apprently u get another hold, but i forgot to
ive had 2 4 year advisors and they were both useless
the premed advisor cancelled on me last minute and said she's not allowed to meet with me since I'm an incoming freshman
Rip
but my four year advisor said she couldn;t answer some questions and that it was best I ask her
If thatâ€™s a standard thing, sucks but youâ€™ll figure it out when you get to campus
Oh guh
yeah I had to leave in the middle a math class lecture at my cc and book a room so I don't disturb the library and I also emailed my professor in advance
who needs them when we have helpful and patient upperclassman like you guys
Like I know Iâ€™m taking it in the fall but do I need to do anything else? (put it into cart etc)
Im not sure when but you donâ€™t do anything now, just make sure you dont enroll in too many classes so you can take it
And for chemistry, should I take 111 or 105? I never took chem in HS 😭
Idk if I can self-study properly for this month and be successful in the fall
My advisor also recommended 111 after I told her I didnâ€™t take chem
it honestly shouldnt matter too much, 111 is more geared towards engineering whereas 105 is what premeds generally take
i didnt know any chem, like i had last taken a chem class in 8th grade, it was a challenge but honestly very doable
Oh
Also I think the math major has other options to fulfill your "other science series" requirement if you don't even want to take chem
Fun aside: I have CHEM 111 credit but kinda forgot about 145 so I'm probably going to be taking it as a senior 😎
These are the other science options for the math major
Case students and leaving intro level classes until senior year, name a more dynamic duo
astronomy 101 and 103 is also an option, though they only list it under applied math
I do, but id rather have more time for silly math classes
It might only be an option for applied math
jake is pure math and did it
they dont list it but an advisor or smth told him it works for pure math too
I think because we're mathematicians we need an actual definition for silly math class
Math class that has me giggling and kicking my feet and shit
Any math class that makes you hysterical after midnight because you cant figure out one hw problem
How about a math class which is at least 2 of the 4:
- Offered at most once every two years
- Is a 400-level class
- The name of the class is either the plural of a noun or the title of a GTM book
- Has <= 15 people in it
Maybe we need more criteria
So Introduction to Topology is definitely a silly little math class
At the last OX scholarship dinner I formulated a law about math classes
Geometry 1 is also a silly little math class
Is 394/494 not a silly little math class
I took it last spring 😎
Tbh a lot of pure math classes are silly little math classes
Unfortunately you may also need to graduate on time
the thing stopping me from taking so many classes i want to
Bulletin and math dept website disagree
O-week I will be strolling into Meckes' office with one (1) humble request
Your phone is hungry
My dissertation is that I want to take more classes but donâ€™t want to spend money so you should give me a PhD and tenure so I can be paid to take classes and also maybe teach them sometimes
Iâ€™d like to be but idk how to become one
Please don't
You ask, but for math classes it really does not occur
oh
Most other math classes just have graduate students who grade work though
oh so there's no chance
they are SIs btu they essentially do what a ta would do so idk why they arent tas
I was going to join the Butler squad next semester, but alas a funny math class happened
Oh, weird
Adam please TA for a class Iâ€™m taking 🥺🥺🥺
my prof wants 4 TAs and there were 5 juniors and 15 seniors in the class last spring
and i did really well in the class
Why does your professor need one TA for every five students????
Fascinating. Maybe if I ever find more free time in the math mines
theyâ€™re graduate students tho
i think they are phd students arent they?
maybe its a mix of both cuz mine was a phd student
The only person I ever heard of TAing for an undergrad math class was someone TAing for MATH 330 because he was doing research with the professor
In the spring? Ideally: Real 2, complex, phys 122, and perhaps a Silly Math Class
Remember that I am a math and English major
the phd student i work under more often calls herself a graduate student
MD - Doctor of medicine
TA - Teaching Assistant
SOM - School of Medicine
Thatâ€™s a CS class in my heart
fair enough
I was requested as a grader for abstract algebra but the math department said no 😡
i had med student TAs for a couple weeks in my neuroanatomy class
I don't think that med students are usually expected to act as TAs
Wtf that wouldâ€™ve been so swag
hey jake I remember you saying you were sick or smth you feelin aight now?
We have the same brain wtf 😭
i donâ€™t think my grad student eats
i never see her eat
Oh and then the grad student who got the TAing told me he didnâ€™t even want to do it 😭 😭 😭
Seems like an inefficient allocation of labor to me
I think we're slowly morphing into the final form of what a pure math major does to you
i had one for 216L that was researching viruses and she was like. this class has nothing to do with my phd research. iâ€™m just doing this one instead of 215L because the instructor is better
cause it was dr. burden-gulley and sheâ€™s an icon
wtf why did my phone want your TA to be unfashionable
not towards u tho â¤ï¸
Keeps people on their toes
i MISS you will you be at freshman move in
I wrote an essay for my senior year English class about how much I hated this one album
because even tho i am an upperclass RA i still have to help
idk what iâ€™ll be doing!
Theyâ€™re supposed to hold community building events n stuff too I think but it didnâ€™t happen much for us
Oh they don't seem like opps my friend was bullshitting me
got it, don't be an asshole
seems like a recurring theme
Ugh, but i wanted to do that every thursday for fun
uh oh
RAs are often RAs bc they have to be for financial reasons. they donâ€™t want to discipline but often have to bc their housing depends on their job
the amount of times the fire alarm has gone off cuz ppl have forgotten to put water
I never forgot to put water in my tnt cannon in mc, why would I forget it for ramen
yeah and itâ€™ll happen when you donâ€™t want it to
i can think of once when it was an actual fire (house 2 last semester)
yeah one time it was my room and i was literally asleep in my bed and my roommate was gone
I always wanted my dorm room to spontaneusly become a water park
Our fire alarm went off while I was in the shower and it was near freezing outside
dw freshman dorms donâ€™t have sprinklers
idk if that
is good or bad
You didn't get a room????
Ah nice. I didnâ€™t really ever go to 4th floor. I was 218
i got broken up with in your room!
Poor Hannah
Alex will be inheriting a rich and layered history in the Not Found room
idk when exactly
but itâ€™s early
so idk
some guy did this, afaik it did not work though
Didnâ€™t beg hard enough
He really is near the end
get this man in office!!
i canâ€™t count
isn't he almost a centenarian
lol he could run for office again tbh since it seems to be normalized to have really old people as president
they were last year
except heâ€™s in hospice
~~i don't think that's necessarily a disqualifier~~
i didnâ€™t experience a single fire alarm actually
managed to miss all of the alarms freshmen year but was almost the cause of one last year
fire alarm went off like two minutes after i put cookies in the oven i was so stressed that somehow the oven would turn back on and burn the entire building down
i knew i couldnt leave yall hanging not knowing how they turned out 😤
Did you have boarding school
It's a hard knock life
Takes more work to maintain friendships with people on the other side of campus
I lowkey feel like I'm cut off from a fair amount of Greek life lore because we're a Northside frat
i wonâ€™t be almost nextdoor to ox anymore :(
i wonâ€™t be there during o week
Ohhh rip
Don't some chapters have their meetings in Strosacker
2 hours to death
An hour and a half
it's not at 7 AM anymore
1 more hour and 10 minutes
Ope I cut out the boxes
Trying to see if I have to prepare for something @27
I donâ€™t think so if you validated
Or does that not work
Oh so I donâ€™t have reload ?
Nah you shouldnâ€™t have to
So many freshman with ap credit tho
If yâ€™all are just waiting you should download a phone app that gives the time in seconds
Do I have better chance using sis on my phone or my computer?
i would use your computer
donâ€™t need an app, you can just use time.is
i also like to hit register instead of validate a decent bit before hand bc sometimes they change the process
So is our spot taken once we hit enroll or is the process not over until we hit confirm?
Also even if u donâ€™t get a class now keep checking it during add/drop bc people do drop classes a decent amount
I think weâ€™re supposed to..??
for me when I hit enroll it takes me straight to the list of classes and outcomes without anything in between
Isn't it just an error message
i never pull up the clock until like 5 min before it makes me too anxious
Omg
You REALLY want those classes huh
Validate just says if you can take the class
dont we just select all the check boxes and then hit enroll at 9
oh
oh icic
itâ€™s usually a good idea to validate  way beforehand in case you need a permission request. like for example i took chem 323/324 and it wasnâ€™t entered in as a coreq/prereq for orgo 2 lab. and i didnâ€™t know until 6:55am
ohh the slots open
Uh oh
(hes a lil slow)
im wondering if a spot in one class is taken are you still enrolled in the other classes or does it just show the error and stop the entire registration
you just donâ€™t get the full one
it doesnâ€™t stop you
Iâ€™m going on a cruise in a few hours
And last night
Spirit lost my luggage
And cruise in like 2 and a half hours
Wyf am I gonna do? Idk!
I got 2 hours to shop
oh
basically a smaller class with a TA
fair
the other one has 2 seats open currently tho 💀
oh nevermind then
3 mins
way worse in the spring
My heart is beating so quickly rn I canâ€™t do this 😭
ah okay fair
close discord
IM SO SCARED
Fair
im such a terrible person
😭😭😭😭😭 I didn't get one of the classes
Kinda anticlimactic canâ€™t believe itâ€™s over
Stop the stupid site crashed already😭😭
SHIT
I LOST IT
If youâ€™re missing a class or some, find other classes youâ€™d want to take and enroll in them once the site is back up. Feel free to do permissions/overflow requests but donâ€™t expect to get them
got my classes but not the times i wanted but ill take it
FUCKING HELL
oh
Maybe itâ€™s earlier now but donâ€™t sweat it
IM NOT TAKING A MATH CLASS
I hate everything
UGH im taking bio lab at 5:30 pm now this SUCKS!!!
cause
5 mins in between some of them
Late night labs suck but at least everyone there is gonna be in the same boat
when you go to register for the class
They didnt have enough labs open
Maybe I am blind but didnâ€™t see any 5min slots
nope not in anything
nvm i read math 120 as 11:35 and not 11:25
Damn
broke
worst case scenario you just have to take it in the spring
thats what i was gonna do if i didnt get intro to asl
I guess I can do any
oh
I donâ€™t know if I should be concerned 😭
It doesnâ€™t work for me  : (
Doesnt work on my iPad
oh
oh im on a pc
try on your computer
Ooh I actually don't know for AIQS (I still use the old system)
I don't think so, any 27ers in the chat?
There is one aiqs that has an additional meeting and it is listed so I assume the rest dont have any
Should I pick an option that is back to back with CSDS132 or bad idea?
Also if a class says 1st half semester
They're pass/fail classes, no homework, you just show up and play
You can if you want. I haven't but you absolutely can
Just the two classes. Nothing additional unless they want to meet with you in the writing resource center about an essay
Like I donâ€™t need both to fulfill credits
it doesnt tell us the prof
ASU has an entire class on t swift
thatâ€™s terrible
I guess thatâ€™s fair
Thereâ€™s apparently an AIQS for that
is anyone else's aiqs portal still not open 😭
It was just super slow
it seems like most people can access it, but i havent been able to at all
Damn that sucks
Maybe contact the office
so i dont have to do anything rn
Oh yeah there arent choices for that one
This exam schedule is so much better than my exam schedule last semester
No, they're all at the very end of exam season
Damn
I'm going to ask some of my professors if I can take their finals early so I don't have to do whatever this is
do we have finals for our aiq?
7:30pm exam????
That was the OS exam time slot until he said nvm
unfortunately none of them are considered officially reschedulable
you black out for an hour as you enter the exam alternate dimension
I have 3 finals in a 24 hour period so I can reschedule one of them
then you don't think about it and go abt your day
im not too worried
if it was math 120's final
i refuse to believe any exam is taking me 3 hours
Historically I've finished most of my finals early
I usually finish my finals early but I compulsively double-check my work over and over again until time is up
Personally imma big try to estimate how many point you got based on the likelyhood of questions being wrong guy
Also remember how he said a question had a typo? I didn't hear that and spent a solid 15 minutes trying to figure out what the actual hell was going on
I was so confused until I realized there was a misprint
Oh right you said that and I didn't even read it
I remember spending literal hours on a exam practice problem only to realize that it was misprinted
I'm going to invent a new scheduling strategy called "exam-maxxing" where you try to get as many exams in the same 24 hour period as possible
Charlie is inventing a new strategy to fail as many classes as possible
imagine you have an exam in all 4 exam slots
i feel like you could do this optimally as a music major by taking as many cim classes as possible
theyâ€™re both towards the end but i need to stay all of finals anyway bc of RA stuff
had a december 18th final last year when the only other ones hit the 12th at the latest
we didn't find out until late november iirc that it was being done online
also he forgot to post the final and was on a plane so i was writing my music history final on the 20th
I think I did too, but I got most of the points on that exam
You could have made your new name "Alex Math and CS Class of Twenty-Eight" instead but noooooo
kinda based shit
They've gotten really bad
MATH 308 reference (no spoilers)
Short
math major
I'm short, have glasses, and I'm a math major . . . Guys am I cooked?
I feel like nurses should actually know at least a little math
Been working on this for the last 2 years
so that wasnt even a good dig on alex
Yeah but theres no way your vision is as bad as mine
Alex see you officially dont need glasses anymore
I already dont wear them running or jim
I am hesitant to answer though, I feel like this is a trial
and if I fail, I will be kicked from case
I'm really bad at remembering who wears glasses
I go in the math major bin
Nope I was going to suggest her
Well, depending on how tall Alex is I could qualify for being short
Do we have a short friend who isn't a math major and doesn't wear glasses?
I know someone but idk if anyone else knows her too
But are any freshmen here short, non based majors, and no glasses?
Iâ€™m sure someone is short, not a math major, and not a glasses wearer
Iâ€™m using it as a shorthand for math
Then I guess I qualify
Rip
It's fine we need a math major who's not short and doesn't wear glasses too
Idk I'm not picky
I happened to be chosen one semester (by another math and CS major, go figure) who towers over me and just about everyone else
Except maybe Marcus and Owen
omg featured
Short math major rep
people when they come across a screenshot of a tweet showing a very basic algebra or order of operations problem and they can't solve it anymore
Oh yeah I thought thatâ€™s what you were trying to do lmfao
thats fair still you will have someone other than the 5'3 guy to be taller than
I just want more people who are on my eye level lol
I would probably be well below eye level if you stole my femurs
yeah who needs those
But yeah I love my tall friends but sometimes it's tiring to have to stand back a foot or two so I don't hurt my neck trying to look at their faces
Isn't that what engr 399 is for?
Charlie, if you can steal my femurs without waking me up, it is ethical
You would have to be really asleep
Ah but Charlie is not an engineering major so he can do whatever he wants
Not really
But idk I am pretty short but I'm also not so short that it's usually an inconvenience to my life
So I don't really care
Except when my brothers put the mugs at the back of the top shelf 😭
i canâ€™t use the top two shelves in my cabinets
oh I see very confusing (it is not, im just slow)
Cabinets should be shorter for us short kings and queens
I need to make one
I think my brother has decided he doesnt want to go just because im going
Tbh the men who get the most shit for being short are like 5'7 or 5'8 😭
Would you be a pal and make one because it seems I cannot
If someone tells me I'm short I say "okay and?" But a 5'8 guy will say "IM NOT SHORT IM AVERAGE"
Sure what do you want
Math major / CS major / Glee Club
The problem with that is that it won't save the initial thing so it's better if I do it all at once
Charlie you are math and Glee Club
hey you don't know that I'm not a cs major yet
never too late to add on
~~I am joking I can't touch code again after the incident~~
i am 5'8 and when shopping for clothes i very much feel like below average height
hate that
I want to go hiking round spain
Guess what happens when students are waiting for the light and a car comes by
One of my papers for a SAGES was about how the walkways donâ€™t always deal with rain well
Well of course the roads are bad, how are the workers supposed to fix them if you cracked the municipal code open
Happened to me once downtown but ive heard it from others too
i still havent learned to stand back 😭
iâ€™ve never gotten splashed with water but i constantly wore the same pair of sandals freshman year and i learned my lesson the first big rain we got
It doesnâ€™t seem to work on iOS
Once someone has computer access weâ€™ll do it properly and give it the right name
this has happened to me waiting at the euclid crossing
Donâ€™t
I had a block of classes from 11:30-3:45 last semester
I ate between
15 mins?
If itâ€™s a large class, not really
What I would do is eat in the classroom before class began and put my food away when it started
people ate in my morning math lecture (8:25am so usually dunkin or something for most people) and aiqs, no one seemed to care. no one ate in my chem or cs. in my japanese class you werent allowed to eat
Thatâ€™s fair
oh- that too :lmfaocry: was gonna do another interview with nat geo but they just rescheduled for 7 pm rip
@wanningswontons wtf i didnt know u were that amazing
but i cant seem to find her on RMP
Yea cuz it doesnâ€™t tell you what profs teach what on the sign up right?
Nope
awww it's the uh- it was my intersections poster thingy :nhs_blushhh:
First person to learn why Lindsey Wang wants YOU! to snort Ozempic today
â€œHow many credits is too muchâ€
Jake "Math/English" Twentyseven, California (the bad one), corporal, Luenter
My roommate found my Instagram but I didn't give them my Instagram so I don't know how tf they got it
There's no way it's through my number cause I have the contacts off for insta so my family doesn't find it 😭
It's not connected to my actual identity either
My boss-ish at my job last summer found mine even though Iâ€™ve never posted or commented in any way
yeah just that my insta isnt
I didn't get into *insert ivy leage/top 20*
My school capped it at 12
(Imagine 70 is in all caps even though they're numbers)
It can feel frustrating when the whole UC or UCAS system counts as 1 or something
i could never be that confident bro
I think I did six? But I took a few back after i got into CWRU
thatâ€™s fair
It was case or nothing for me really
my states flagship school is decently competitive and the non flagship ones arenâ€™t that great so ig that forced my hand in applying to more
Idk if I even applied to Penn State
ohio state pretty much guarantees admission to in-state students with a good enough hs gpa so i wasnt too scared
had the risk of going to a branch campus though
Oh yeah PSU isnâ€™t hard to get into
Itâ€™s kinda shocking if you donâ€™t get in
I didn't get in ||because I didn't apply||
iâ€™m applying to 12 graduate programs at 11 schools and thatâ€™s a lot for grad school but grad school acceptance rates are lower/inconsistent across programs
so i actually canâ€™t really chance it that well
I mean I applied to trade school, I was gonna work in the integral mines
forgot abt that
and like a lot of the schools i applied to i didnâ€™t actually want to go to. not a ton but like. there were a few.
a few of the schools i really like for grad school i didnâ€™t even THINK about for undergrad
i donâ€™t want to go into academia so it doesnâ€™t really matter where i go to grad school. if i wanted to be a professor it would matter
> don't want to go into academia
skill issue
to work in industry in the field i want to work in you need a graduate degree to get a decent salary
and i want to work in industry
it would take me longer to get to the pay of someone with a phd than it would to just get the phd
i want to work in pharmaceuticals headass
Oh no
i actually donâ€™t want the entry level so thatâ€™s why iâ€™m going for a phd
iâ€™m taking a medchem class next sem iâ€™m so pumped
sorry was still scrolling through before I saw that 🥲
Never too much lore to catch up
(got in but no money. i heart cwru scholarships)
I am low income, so when I was applying to college I applied to safety schools and schools that said they would (or could) meet full need
Alex â€œno amount of math credits is ever hardcore enoughâ€ I think your privileges of having a say on this should be revoked
i was scared cwru was gonna waitlist me bc they were need aware and met 100%
or another school
idk which one
it probably wasnâ€™t uva. idk i got 5 waitlists
At the end I was choosing between cwru and my safety schools and decided to go to cwru because it was easier to transfer back to my state school than the other way around if I was unhappy
I spent $0 on college apps
It's better if you didn't pay for them lol
On one hand yes, on the other mad respect for writing sm supplemental essays and putting in the work?
I never want to relive senior year
End of Junior to senior
the existential fear and instability of college apps man
senior year was insane bc college apps were sooo terrible and awful but my situationship graduated so i had a full year post covid and post him at a school that i loved so uh. senior year was very year for sure
Actually arguably the worst year of my life for other lore
Aside from applications and final exams, senior year was great
Except I got to watch my high school choir continue the process of implosion that started in 2020 (it is almost dead now)
ha! we didnt have to take finals as seniors
The only one I can remember getting fired from my school was this insane health/pe teacher that made a kid run when their ankle was broken
If you want an intro to UWC lore come find me for a 3 hour orientation
We took school finals and ib exams
Idk how she didn't get fired earlier
Ib made me hate my life 🙃
Nothing will ever be worse than that exam season
Okay my teachers were bad but not like this. Ick!
off topic but PE is probably the most useless subject in american school system, so much lost potential to actually teach people to take care of themselves
IAs + college apps
The teachers kept yelling at us to empty our pockets. I didn't have any pockets but I would still try to
History ia was such a pain because of that
Comparing the exam schedules, gonna be a chill end to this semester
that is somehow even worse than math
Comp sci IA was the absolute worst!
Ur teacher has lost the plot
i went from reading 2 decently long books a week in elementary school to not reading a single book for enjoyment until senior year
💀 shes done worse things she's gone now but girl traumatized like years worth of children
(i need to finish the books sitting on my shelf)
i got 4 books from the library two weeks ago and still havent opened the first one
I had a bio/homeroom teacher leave the class because a kid sneezed
He didn't want to "catch our disease"
one of the pe coaches at my middle school was actually obese and def could not run, kind of a fail at setting an example
i am still bitter about it to this day
Came back in the class with a mask that covered his entire face
Idk what they're called
The teacher I've been talking about was an old lady that was looked immensely unhealthy and had like 0 body fat
💀 her health class curriculum has like half my grade relapse
Ive come to the conclusion that high schools universally suck
When I lived in Germany it was WAY worse
All of my male teachers in elementary school/middle school were creeps
Well you left out the capital letter 🤓🤓🤓
I had a history teacher who apparently had an affair IN the classroom
I wasn't that athletic in junior/senior year so he took no interest in me
Not complaining tho
Damn no adam reveal
Dont think Iâ€™ll be there
sounds kinda lame
Are you sure it wasnâ€™t just a robot claiming to be him
Idk why I'm like this but there's a certain trait I see in certain brunettes that makes me remember them as having red or auburn hair
Don't be shy u can share with the class
I'm not even one of them though
Tbh I donâ€™t even know if I could pick him out of a group rn
Ive never seen @jschlanket
u should, its the truth, id never lie not like i could *lie* about not lying
Michael (the math one) and Kaavya
Iâ€™ve never seen you either ||short man||
Just call me â€œthe math oneâ€ from now on
I was very surprised to find that my boyfriend used to be blond as a kid
I used to have straighter hair but it started getting much wavier/curlier during puberty
so much so that tyler couldnâ€™t believe we were a couple!
math physics history? who cares they are all inferior compared to nursing or breaking bad
Is breaking bad code for chemistry
Y'all will find out what I look like during move-in and CS and/or math meet and greets
I'd like to think you won't know me when you see me but ...
Stereotypical math nerd look?
I don't wear glasses
Idk Adam, Hannah, or other irls what stereotype do I look like
There is nothing wrong with enjoying minecraft
~~I mean occasionally I do play it~~ BUT not during the school year
idk
Donâ€™t deny your fate
I never said there was
one time my friend told me i look like i ate lunch with my english teacher in high school
That wasn't even my intention lol
dangerous many friendships could be destroyed
Dude donâ€™t out me like that
Rip Hannah's house
it made me so sad
When I was 14 I had to go into the office and tell the vice principal what Minecraft was
I ran a server and two people fought so much on the server that they got into a literal fistfight *in real life* in the locker room
why does this feel like something I would do
Well minecraft is a very serious matter. Could mean life or death sometimes
Well, I've never played it if you don't count fucking around on my friends Xbox
0/10, green roof to fight climate change which isn't real
Itâ€™ll have to constantly be raining tho
That one time i covered spawn in obsidian cuz someone killed my cat
Took way too long to find that screenshot
I feel like it doesn't rain as much as it used to tbh
Iâ€™m just salty, the last time I was there it downpoured the entire weekend
The first time I visited Cleveland it broke my umbrella
Mined the obsidian pillars in the end
That must* have taken so much time
I spent ~8 hours mining obsidian
But it doesn't anymore right??
Is Cleveland weather actually that bad??
The weather here is just pure randomness
idk dude the blood is on your hands
What are you trying to get done
Anything other than staring at my phone all day
I wouldn't really say it's "that bad" but a lot of umbrellas tolerate high wind poorly
I've been taking the derivative of the exponential function all summer
am I really if I'm yapping on discord instead?
No I just know it's gonna be terrible
on one hand: get life together and break short term dopamine cycle
I've never even touched snow
Luckily I have mountains nearby me but the last time it snowed in my hometown was in 2009
So I feel you
As soon as I walk into the math building Iâ€™ll be an integral machine
My phone should NOT autocorrect than to then
💀 at least ur studying I'm just letting my brain rot till school starts
As Iâ€™m trying to solve this integral with an infinite series
Everyday I open my computer thinking I'll study but then....I watch a bunch of series instead
Infinite series??? Math reference???
What series though
I'm not nearly into math as much (no offense)
Ur so real for that in the last month I've watched so much one piece
dude i went to a catholic middle school and a nun subbed for my history class one day and took the whole class to see the principal bc we were talking instead of working (it was a group project)
math and not math
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ math majors love their math ig
(I hope I never take phy or math again)
I literally cackled out loud cuz who even says that
💀 I took ap physics 1 last year worst year of my life 0/10 would not recommend
You wanted to do CS or CE right
don't even need it for nursing :(
Might be cuz I don't rmbr sharing? Idk maybe I'm tripping
How much math have you gotten through? Because you have to do up to Calc III and linear algebra for CS BS
also might get you in trouble so idk if Id do that
I was bored Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
And the worst type of physics
Okay but he called us cattle so it's fair
Yea but instead itâ€™s Alex and heâ€™s reading a math book
I would bike home from school with both hands off the handlebars looking at my phone
Itâ€™s a miracle I didnâ€™t get hurt now that I think about it
oh no we've summoned him
1000 something page math book??? Can those legally exist?
Alex | Math + CS '28 is typing
No thanks only math I need is stats
IN THIS ROOM I HAVE FIFTY MATH MAJORS AND WHOEVER LEAVES LAST GETS **A MILLION DOLLARS** AND A DOZEN NEW MATH TEXTBOOKS! BEGIN THE COUNTDOWN!
YEAH TINK/TWING STUDY OVER????
you could not do one for the rest of your life, no nintendo games or no math
Damn the math textbooks might be worth more than the million
Don't remember them now tho
When I was in 3rd grade there were three Jacob's in my class but two of them had the same last initial so we had to call them by their full names
I used to do this but itâ€™s like trying not to get wet while swimming
(he takes that one philosphy class on evil)
charlie i hate to break it to you
but iâ€™m going to be 22 in 3 months
What happened to the chem part?
technically iâ€™m still declared as a secondary major in chem
i filled out the paperwork to drop it and it hasnâ€™t been dropped
Never will
Ive been saying case for ~6 years already my ways wont change
we canâ€™t interfere
i just hate it when people say case western
i dont know the songs unfortunately
Hard z
I won't be mad
math majoring is
Boo nursing better
Theres gonna be a real math vs nursing rivalry atleast for our class
nursing v math dodgeball fight
This sounds like itd be unfair with how many more nursing majors there are than math majors, im in
I guess math majors are just WAY louder
Will this count as pe class?
We need to organize a specific cardio games section one semester and flood it with math and nursing majors
you are not supposed to share that
Alright it is gone
Omg live performance?
i am fully at work rn
there isnt one on the youtube somehow
Wasn't he blasting his music?
hello sorry technical difficulties
Imagine that but 1000x worse
No but I imagine it would be bad?
Worst timing ever
clapping so hard rn
me when I joined early
bye
If yâ€™all are still there in 50 minutes I will be back
I hope someone was on the shitter
I hope that if someone was on the shitter they feel very special
HOLY SHIT CHARLIE FACE REVEAL
also I would like to mention I happened to be wearing a CWRU free t-shirt through this whole thing
(I need to do laundry)
Wow we feeling the school spirit today yall
rip ASS University
They shouldnt have changed it
idk if anyone cares but there is in fact a youtube alma mater if people want a less jank version https://youtu.be/LRYCGCFqlB0
This is still really good tho
Taking into account the following factors: 
- Brown hair
- Canâ€™t grow a beard but it would probably be ginger if he did
- Looks like he enjoys minecraft
I believe i have found adam
alex you cant just say that and not drop the guess
This is what I got so far red is Adam yellow is Charlie idk where sophie and Eric are 😔
unfortunately you are 0 for 2
If you guess about me, I don't want to be doxxed so I will DM you right or wrong
Charlie and/or others are free to do as they wish
You can guess who I am if you want
I don't like the sarcasm
||what gave it away?||
For that reason I'm joining the math major Dodge ball team
Damn it
Sorry the nursing majors are trying to change your mind
Lol fair
I've been wronged and I don't forgive easily
I mean that too I guess
I won a very hardcore sock duel last semester
If he had lost? No more Charlie
And that was the end of Matthew T. 😔
Aw thanks for the heads up! Hopefully a red ball doesn't come zooming ur way.
(I can't throw farther than 2 feet)
No rip Matthew
On an aside I was in a meeting so I didn't really see but did the entire vc leave in like 30 seconds or is my Discord laggy
Oh lordy
Oh Sophie, Can I Guess!
I could just guess every blond person
Sophie, Do I Get To Guess? I Think Iâ€™ve Got It!
Omg I hate discord
Idk how to use this thing
Rip Daniel
Do I still get a point 😔
my hint for you was that this video was taken after the end of november
Okay but I didn't even know you before November 😭😭
But oh I remember what happened right before November
no unfortunately
another hint: i dont have glasses
sorry that's owen
i dont know how to take this
Yk you win some you lose a lot of times
Last try
I forgot to circle it
that's a david unfortunately
Eric is not visible in that photo so you may not be able to find him
Bro circled my guess for adam, that was mine dont copy my work
Oh 😭
This is really a witch hunt isnâ€™t it
So I took your work in a different way
Damn it
If he's in the photo you can't see his face lol, I mean, I can't find him and we're pretty good friends
Yeah I donâ€™t see him either
i'm very interested in all the guesses people are making tho
why would eric not be in the picture tho
I am so sorry Sophie I do give up
oh but iâ€™m like the only active person who wonâ€™t be there oweek
damn
Rip
This will sound dumb but how is it doxxing if we will be at the same school
Idk?
Either way im moving on the 16th
I probably will be there bc Iâ€™ll be already in Ohio and I have friends moving in on that day
Can't you move in as well?
Nope technically not
Sucks to suck 🤷â€â™€ï¸
(My parents won't let me 😔)
Plus I need to move everything out
And I won't be bringing it back to my country so storage it is
And can't have too much stuff cuz then that gets expensive, I think?
My stuff to store fit in 2 boxes so I didnâ€™t need very much space at all
envision weekend is not international students moving in early
i arrive before the freshmen do (iâ€™m already here)
Who doesnt wanna be here
You know you wish you were
I do miss CWRU
I miss my friends and I miss having random conversations at 1 AM and I miss coming to class and being so happy there
I miss studying and doing HW at ungodly hours of the morning because I feel like it
As silly as it sounds I miss Glee Club
Id be shocked if you said you didnt
Do *you* not miss it???
Well Iâ€™ve never been
They keep giving and taking me my aid smh. Fafsa sucks
I just need to know how many loans I gotta take out
Yeah idk why aid is so delayed this year
So annoying
Idk if its the same for you but we were told weâ€™ll get our charges on july 23rd
my research grant apparently can only be issued on Jan 1 so idfk what Iâ€™m gonna do for the next 5 months
i actually got mine at the end of june but it wasnâ€™t correct until last week
Can't live like this
I want to start harassing them but I also donâ€™t want them to take it out on me
They already hate me so idk
If itâ€™s more than the net price calculator said Iâ€™m gonna be so mad
Like they legit cannot expect my parents to pay over 50% of their salary towards college
hey guys what's wrong with ohio?
Ain't nothing wrong with Ohio
It's an Internet meme though which is why I use the skull emoji when discussing Ohio 💀
Itâ€™s boring
It doesnâ€™t spell the same backwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhaLhHIrYCA i guess it was sam ash actually, same vibes tho
however hoping the appeal goes well bc my parents estimated income for 2024 is like half of 2022
Unfortunately
my mom apparently
cause she wants to bring me back on some weekends so ig
3:05 isn't even that late to get out of classes lol
You can still go home after that, unless you have to fly like 7 hours
10 hour drive
prob longer cause she wants to like
that wonâ€™t be practical except for long weekends
its just for doctors appointments apparently not like im there for anything majorly important
and then i probably leave early next morning or late that night idk
I just flip letters in my head so I misspelled it (classic Axel)
Arabic doesnâ€™t have â€œeâ€ or â€œoâ€ sounds
The verb system alone makes it cooler than almost any European language
I forgot about that
I knew it was something weird but I guess I just didnâ€™t remember exactly what
Oh the plural of kitab is kutub
Honestly if you really need to be home for an essential doctors appointment you can just tell your professor and probably skip class. As long as you don't do it every weekend it'll probably be fine
Okay I need to lobby that immediately
I feel like that would fly for my floor but idk who the general population will feel
Lol it wasn't for literally everyone in the dorm, just a group of us who had become friends early on
We didn't have that much in common besides living in the same freshman dorm
But I got really screwed for room selection
Me when I randomly invite myself to shit
Jake shouted "cut it out!" so often that he became known as The Cutter Cutter
I just went to bed early and hoped
I need to practice mario kart again, im rusty
I'm actually terrible at Mario kart
I will lose to all of you so fast itâ€™s unreal. count me in
Damn maybe I have to shell out the money for the expansion tracks
Let me set the scene for something real quick:
It is May 11th. The CSDS 281 final is at 8 AM sharp. It is currently 2:30 AM and Adam Hutchings is trying to sleep, hoping to get at least four entire hours before his final. Adam Hutchings lives on the second floor of Raymond House. What is happening in the common room, and can Adam Hutchings hear it from Adam Hutchings' room?
Someone ripping apart a foosball table with his bare hands for 400
I am entirely kidding, unfortunately no
Phone a friend?
Oooooo that's a really hard question imma have to guess b?
You have no idea what type of school you have enrolled in
FUCK
One of my friends says it's his favorite game ever but unfortunately I have not played it
Fuck now I need to grind
I personally cannot stomach 8 hours of the 1976 dune board game but some people love it
let me in im also rlly bad
💀 imagine having Mario kart and being able to grind
Mine obsidian for 8 hrs?
"sorry I'll be busy from 2pm to 10pm"
Update: I haven't a picture
Well it wouldnâ€™t be an opium den without the opium
Times change but opium doesnt
The room was apparently once called the California Room
I have a single, and it is room 307 (as in MATH 307, linear algebra) so it is called The Eigenspace
Iâ€™d be amazed if tabletop club didnâ€™t have every version
Shit I canâ€™t compete
axel | nursing + math '28
+math
Anything + math
no math
Physics - math = ?
Did someone summon Jake Bridge
I donâ€™t think you have to put the last part in, I might be assumed
Idk why itâ€™s not required in the base physics major
Like Iâ€™ve said in the past, if you do not go to class, you do not skip Meckes linear algebra. Meckes linear algebra skips you
Jake do you have any other sayings regarding the class
The amount of content he is able to clearly and effectively lecture through in 50minutes is crazy tbh
Pretend there isnâ€™t a typo there
Didnâ€™t notice
Which tends to lead to me either being extremely hot in the summer because I'm overdressed or cold in the winter because I'm underdressed
I'm also 120 pounds so I'll be cold regardless
Last time I wore shorts outside i was 12
And it was purely because my washing machine was broken at the time
damn
I hate wearing clothes that show skin
one of the senior astronomers at work today was walking around barefoot 💀
i literally just sit at a computer all day
and yet
and itâ€™s warm for longer in the fall semester
Here in CA wearing any layers or long sleeves during the summer would be a death sentence
you donâ€™t have niche state vibes
damn youâ€™re exposing me
i forgot that im very open about that youre right
im sure ive mentioned but weve gone to school together since fifth grade
i feel like we dont really
i donâ€™t think anyone from my hometown has ever gone here
one time someone who was very into linguistics clocked me as new england and that scared me
i feel like mine is very general american
but iâ€™ve been told you can hear SNE in my vowels
not really i feel
Maybe if you have bad vision
But yeah nope
How the fuck would you not pronounce them the same way
Thankfully bc my dad's from MA I'm not stuck saying Ahrange
Why would i ever pronounce cotangent like caught, but also still no why would you pronounce those the same?
Spot the math major (impossible)
Canâ€™t find em
Thats such a bad thing to lead with when you dont type the other part in like half a second 😭
caught is much longer
Iâ€™ll stick to math instead of linguistics
i canâ€™t help it
i just realized that my little is from wisconsin and so they probably also call it a bubbler
Damn it.
i forgot what i call it and itâ€™s not an air sip
When you pour a drink into your mouth without touching your lips to it
💀💀 and yet the fountain is not a fountain
Okay I have never heard birdie
Sorry that'd be me
Sadly no
But maybe there is one over there that i dont know about
I have never had Culver's
Wtf
Culver's also doesn't exist where I'm from
what a sad life you all lead
iâ€™ve never even been to DQ
I assume so, they could've just been standing on the strip though
sorry was asking alex we should dress up at this
A man can dream
I was irrationally obsessed with dairy queen as a child who had never been to dairy queen
Me neither actually. Not because it doesn't exist near me, just never bothered
and still has not been to dairy queen
Ok my turn wtf is a buccees
Fair but itâ€™s the meme
donâ€™t know when!!
I still need to get to one someday
I mean is it really a gas station anymore if its the size of a walmart
I'm half irish masshole half jew
Be mean apparently
That would hurt like 2 people
Boring
Texas(s) summer = bad
Nursing 🤝 math
      🔥Arson🔥
Hey I'm as much of a pyromaniac as the next guy but arson is generally bad
he only gets 3 weeks pto so
Pain
Yes but a small fraction of the mosquitoes are gone and itâ€™s 2 degrees cooler
insane i hate it so much
he knew he was agreeing to it in taking the job and he doesnâ€™t care that much
Damn that sucks
The day I'm worried for Adam would be a strange day indeed
Me shortly before leaving for CWRU as a freshman
Childhood asthma + I donâ€™t like smoke smell + L
That's so sad 😔
i told myself it would be like 3 hours ago
not you saying cleveland is east coast tho 😭
@jschlanket cars math fire you can only keep 2
Obviously math and fire smh
Idk alex is kinda a crazy car man
Car = cat not vehicle
Stop trying to bring me between my cats
That explosion scared the color out of the video 😭
This is from when I was doing some service work in Jamaica last winter. The hotel set up the bonfire lol it was wild
How was flight?
Lol Biden was at the airport apparently so everything was totally blocked up
Managed to get on the plane with some serious hardship, but then the flight didn't take off for about an hour
Not avg flight exp
So yeah took longer than anticipated
What are the chances of being in the same airport as Biden
Would have never guessed
OH
That is fair
You'd never believe that I was just on the Wikipedia page for William Penn but I am
damn you beat me
Still got a 4 on it but never again >:(
Itâ€™s feeling pretty real right now
Sorry you had to learn it this way
Your gonna want to sit down when you hear this
I guess I haven't seen CO for myself in a few months. I suppose it could have become suddenly not real.
oh no
Simulation type shit
Crisis on infinite earths spoilers(?)

||They really just killed the teen titans damn 💀💀||
well- first time i practiced i ran into THREE trees
today i only ran into one traffic pole 💪
Canâ€™t beat *that* now can you?
guess not heh :Squirrelwiggley:
â€œTo my left is where I drink after midt- I mean â€¦ where people study and get was- â€¦ I mean â€¦ play PokÃ©mon instead of stu- â€¦ anyway letâ€™s just keep walking!!!â€
I am now awake what
I *guess*
Depends on who you ask, bc we can't ever interact with the world as it exists, only as we perceive it
However, since we can't do this, the world "as it exists" doesn't really matter, and we determine what reality feels like for us based on our perceptions and inferences
Matthew you should study quantum mechanics
I actually don't know if it would, I'm more interested in how it feels to be a human in a human-shaped world. Knowing about subatomic uncertainty and quark interactions wouldn't necessarily change that
Fair enough
goodbye linzer
Just tried to find the Instagram of a middle school friend from like 6 years ago and her Instagram bio says "math and CS for the win" BASED
We shouldn't have school October 21/22 right
I imported the schedule to my calendar and that's gone but Thanksgiving still has me as having class
Oh no
i know someone that had one for seasonal allergies
Not having ac isnâ€™t as bad as it sounds it will be - itâ€™s just annoying for the first couple weeks
Yeah, to be fair AC is only useful for a few weeks out of the year, however if you do have a reasonable condition to request it itâ€™s not a bad idea
itâ€™s not bad tbh
It would be expensive to equip all of them with ac since they don't have a central system to manage it
We need a loan of 1 million dollars to equip AC everywhere
Having ac also isn't super useful during the school year
Yeah itll only maybe be bad the first 2-3 weeks and maybe the last week before summer
From all of my 2 years of experience with Ohio, first year it was 50-60 for all but the last *day* of finals, and then last year it was nice like 70-80 like spring *SHOULD* be
it's not oppressive after the first few weeks though
Dude it's in the middle of winter rn and I don't think we've gone below 50
although late spring can have some uncomfy days
It's 58 rn and I'm dying. I will not survive your winter
As before it hasn't snowed here in 15 years, but when I got to Ohio I was fine down to -15 C with fleecy pants, a coat, and a hat
this is terrible 😭
ohio weather is the most bipolar you can experience
itâ€™ll hail, then rain, then sunshine 5 minutes in
washington isn't that extreme but it is more *consistently* bizarre
Not really, I don't think Ohio has ever had a manic episode
down in pickerington itâ€™s pretty bad 😭
Travelling from Denver to Boulder, going to be camping for a few weeks
Neat! I grew up 20 min into the mountains outside Boulder, would commute down for middle and high school
That was the channel we had to mine out my front door
There may be a term some people use but i dont have one for it
I've never had my own term for it
We need an option for "No clue!"
I mean it's a combo of 2 answers bc I gotta job before I can go to grad school Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Omg same 😄
so between 2 of the main blood vessels coming out the left side of your heart there is a ligament that holds them together
this helped short circuit the heart
I learned recently that eyes are fluid-filled, I had assumed they were solid inside
They don't be staying still now do they
because it has 2 loops: pulmonary and circulatory which are respectively to R and L sides, but we don't want a fetus breahting in amniotic fluid so only the left half works thanks to the extra tube (ik everyone was so invested)
it really is
I mean... who needs vision
darn it we were so close
Ik right I learned this on a field trip to some organ donation place and I wanted to know if I could just keep donating my liver
Needles are scary
I actually dont; specifically needles to veins but its a needed evil so im toughing it out
Yeah I mean Iâ€™d rather get a shot than die
Also more well known fact but I still like this one: about half your bones are in the hands and feet
Weâ€™re not climbing tree anymore
Because if we didn't we'd be really fucked up
Youâ€™re not climbing trees anymore
Once upon a time I was on a walk and encountered @quinsential @mounjee and @cawu perched up there studying for a linear algebra final exam
When they run they don't breath they just let their organs slosh around to get oxygen through their body
The one annoying part of hvz is you canâ€™t climb trees during it
That would dox me though
damn you guys are really selling me on this tree
My first research paper: â€œhow many 18-19 year olds can fit in the freshman dorm tree?â€
Oooo Iâ€™m 19 can I be a study participant
Walk 50 feet to the left from the midpoint of the left side
when ppl say cwru doesn't have real sports
Should I broaden the study to include CWRU students in general?
chat so dead everybody just reacting
seems indecisive to some extent tho
oh I gotchu
Synesthesia moment I guess
I have every single 8-wide speed champions car
Didn't know that's a thing but I'm sold give me 20 rn
Sadly I never had any ninjago
Itâ€™s now completely in pieces scattered in my piece drawers, most of the bricks have gone completely yellow
Idk where Iâ€™d put it tho
Who needs floor
never let it leave the room
I don't think stepping on legos is painful
stepping on thumbtacks is a little worse
I think there is enough room on the foot pain scale for both
when decorating for a party last minute
I once tipped over an entire drawer unit of loose pieces- worst few hours of my life
ooooh ouch
we need financing
Ofc who doesnt love legos
wow I just realized college students are broke asf
Exactly, they wouldnâ€™t want us to be sad
pirate ones go hard
I want to big castle set soooo bad
Oh 100%
I only went inside the pirate one once never actually stayed
if hypothetically there was a research convention or smthng conviently near a lego world/land
Iâ€™m sorry man, hopefully you can make new ones one day
You have to have meetings inside in a small room tho
Iâ€™m gonna need to divine intervention to pass
none yet waiting for perm req
I did so bad in high school chem
is it unheard of to change majors bc you didn't get into core courses
Oh shit I forgot that cedar point exists
I wouldnâ€™t be in that frat if it isnâ€™t
Iâ€™m so sad that I havenâ€™t gone to Hershey Park yet, itâ€™s the only good theme park in PA
it's literally at easton though, we could just go
How did i not know that was there ive been to easton and i dont remember it at all
I still need to actually go to the GLSC
Dont lie, ive been here for 18 years
for longer than for a robotics competition
No donâ€™t listen to him alex is from Columbus
My weather app begs to differ
high street's most notable attraction is death by speeding car, euclid has cool things off of it
oh
o-h
in any room, if you shout o-h there is a very strong likelyhood you will get an i-o back
Hates Ohio?
Without philly cheesesteaks i see no importance for your state in the union
I also just spent like 4 weeks for work in plain city right next to der dutchman
it was heaven for my stomach, and hellish for my wallet
that's fair I guess, always room for people to be wrong in the great state of Ohio
Idk if we even let Ohioans in
I can be on campus in an hour so i guess i can just stop by and then plan
I can cut the time in half if i steal my moms car
I have a car, that's probably easier
There are probably still a couple rental scooters up the street
you havent seen me on a bike
Very far west side but still technically in the city
i havent rode a bike in uhhhh
I love bike riding but I hate bike helmets
i broke my finger right before middle school started and dont have a bike my size anymore
They just feel terrible like sensory wise
that is fair
the worst crime
Why do they feel like that
i really should get a helmet for my scooter but ill lose all my street cred that i totally have
need one of those epic helmets i always walked by in toys-r-us as a kid but in adult sizes
If theres ever a fire on campus someone will probably point to one if not both of us 😭
this toddler helmet has no right to go as hard as it does
omg is it glow in the dark
I dont have the know how to do so myself but Im just planting the seed
But also wow 79% of people are wrong
Highlight from last winter: snomongus
Oh oops
The snow amogus is very essential though
isnt it illegal to ride without one 😭
im taking my permit test tmrow and im reviewing and now im confused
tbh alex i donâ€™t really hear a difference in yours
im gonna bawl my eyes out
wish i had a pencil with me at work rn i didnt capture all of the joy in its face
i just saw the email and then this wtf
I've already taken dual enrollment
In 8 of those classes only 1 cared about if you left without saying anything
He also took our phones though so 😭
Taking your phones is crazy work
I hear the same difference as in my father's speech
Based accent though (I have the cot-caught merger)
Am I saying â€œyou sleep on a caughtâ€ or â€œyou get cot doing a crimeâ€
tried feeding a squirrel today
Oh no ...
eh it was skittish, didn't come near
I tried feeding a squirrel once and it bit me \:-(
:omg:
this whole summer (Im staying near)
the money due comes in today but not the aid yet
Last year the aid came out July 25
I emailed about it specifically because I was also worried
i have my pending aid and itâ€™s still scary
I have never even heard of it
I wouldnâ€™t be able to even touch that stuff
Terrible take
Iâ€™d have to study for a while tho
Horrible take
Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m right
I've never tried dr pepper is it really gas
I need to chug soda as a coping mechanism
I guess you too have tetanus circulating in your blood
i drink doctor pepper to fulfill my dreams of drinking motor oil without getting sick
dr pepper is objectively bad and i love it despite that
You all have been gaslit to enjoy the worst soda ever made
i don't think ive ever had mountain dew
Tbh I kinda donâ€™t like soda in general
I went a year without soda bc my mom yelled at me for eating junk food which I rarely do, she doesn't yell at me for it now so my root beer stash is safe
Barq's is the worst its water plus vicks vaporub
mugs and A&W taste the same but really good
Bro I haven't heard of adonis since like rick riordian books
monster worst energy drink imo
You enjoy it while killing your organs
I would never *force* anyone, wave one in front of someone? Maybe
mtn dew baja blast is peak soda tho ngl
to join math and soda??? how could you alex?
bro damn okay
I would not want alex to dissolve
Thankfully Iâ€™ve never really gotten into caffeine regularly
if you get hurt your cats are mine
yea dont
i almost had a bad addiction
I would guess
idk that
Idk how to break it to you, but theres not one close to case
damn
Oh shit I have to done like 1 and a half more of those
I'm to sad to do it :((
... I may or may not still need to do that too
its due in august right?
Sadly no
I learned so much from all those modules (i didnt pay attention to any of it)
it is a sad day
I'mma stuff my pockets with all the hot sauces before leaving
theres an insomnia near case
TSA can't say anything
didn't oscar call it "broke mans crumbl"
Drinking them when studying
both are peak tho
Its not a terrible trek
Broke man's crumbl is still over priced
oh fr?
a FAIR trade
Just you tho, no one else turning 19 is old
If you were wiser youd major in math
idk why it did not register 8/31 = one day away from 9/1
Never tried it
theres cookie dough that isnt edible?
Its cookie dough made without eggs to remove the â€œriskâ€ of salmonella
All cookie dough is edible if youre not scared
fair, I guess it is a time for celebration if you want it to be but also you don't need to stress about doing the perfect thing either
Didnt know that one
damn
evil must be very relative then bc last i checked im not the fire-enjoyer
cold >>>> hot
This statement made me realize how i constantly complain about heat and always want it to he cold but ill gladly stand right next to a fire in the summer
I understandthe pyrotechnics clubs chaotic energy but tbh if I want scared of fire, Id probably want to be a fire fighter
Never watched Avatar
I need to know how far it goes
We're gonna need a constant stream of cookies
how r u gonna water bend something thta doesnt have water though
If theres enough demand then I'll do cakes for birthdays (They're gonna cost u tho)
Donâ€™t leave anything in the fridges tho ppl steal shit
I mean itll be like a week into the semester so how bad could it get in that amount of time
I'm finna spend all of my money on baked goods
I think in the first week we did manage to ||get maggots bc someone left meat out||
all broke to Hayley
need to hire staff
I did these last year
I dont know how to feel about that statement..
idk honestly sis closed
true but still ...
idk if I can talk to you again
controversial take but insomnia cookies r horrible
honestly idk if there is a bad cookie flavor
Never tried insomnia
never tried crumbl either
want to tho
I've never had but ik I can do better
ig we will find out
their chocolate chip kinda sucks tho
is there crumbl idk and not sure if I care enough
unless you count beachwood as close
overhyped but its the only thing open late so i get it
late food wooo
but their snickerdoodle cookie is really good tho
I'm back, what did I miss
what food place near case isnt?
I want one so bad
I wish, need to see if culvers is better there than here or not
Idk if there's a single Culvers within like 2 hours of me
sad (Ive never been to one)
I need
no fr it was very hard to not overeat during my first semester
the more you exercise you grow more blood vessels on your heart
I will imagine itâ€™s like a cat so i donâ€™t think about this in a way that will scare me
i dont like this fact
Damn ok
Anyone got laptop reccs for mech/Aero?
So like how is any other team supposed to compete against this line up?
however the higher u go up the more dead ur cells r
they dont
oh this is more common knowledge but
some people actually lose their eyes because of that
that shit looks scary
Fun anatomy fact: your eyes are foreign to your immune system, so if one gets hurt, often your immune system will realize your eyes donâ€™t belong and attack both and leave you blind! So you might have to remove the hurt eye ASAP
with the amount of fat the average human body has, u can make 7 bars of soap
never want that to happen to me but
so does ur stomach
The funny bone is not a bone but actually an exposed part of the ulnar nerve so when u hit it the brain doesn't know what to do and short circuits sending several pain signals
oh my goodnedd
this is especially evident w cancer tho
just one wrong move and everything goes berserk
Also with humans being bipedal bc the way we evolved is why we have back pain and knee pain
oh what the
Omg same
During vacations if I'm walking and standing all day I will be in pain
there are two cells hard at work at the surface of ur bones: osteoblasts and osteoclasts
but when a woman goes thru menopause estrogen production decreases
so when they say they broke their hip bc they â€œfell downâ€
💀 pls don't remind me
But that also reminds me of this conversation I had in my government class last year
We were doing a socratic seminar and talking about health care and one kid asked if I would still be a nurse if I didn't get paid as much
I would be a nurse bc i want to help people
Yeah I like the money but I'd still do it even if there wasn't money
im going to become a nurse to provide the emotional support many people need to get through their hospitalization
Yes bc they still need help
that is the title i want the most and that is what i will work towards for the next decade
ok answer to tyler tho
ive done nurse shadowing and hospital volunteering, both of which require patient contact
thats true lol wish other paths got us in it earlier
if u start with nursing u can either go into becoming a provider or
go into hospital administration
oh thats an intersting choice, whats appealing about hospital admin
hospital admin controls prices and pr lol
in a country where healthcare is a luxury i want to make it a right
hope i get to work with yall some day, this country needs more people like that in those positions
The system might be broken but we have to work with it to make small changes that can hopefully grow into something bigger
So like some people will get excess bone growth on their feet or hip ir smth and need it shaved down
Don't u love the human body :DDD
I hate that picture so much
@ all the new people, have you considered double majoring in math?
don't do it
theres no 3 seconds so they can just sit in the paint
but ive noticed in the show case he still shoots from 7 meters
curry still being curry
Credit card companies have not left me alone ever since I turned 18
almost lost to south sudan bruh 💀
Idc if embiid is hurt you should not be losing to south sudan
Embiid could be out there on crutches they should still not be down double at any point
i havent watched the full game
My mom has been constantly telling me not to get one but as far as I'm aware
my high school personal finance class was very anti credit card, but it was also somewhat outdated in other areas as well
Me getting 15 dollars cash back and enough miles for a 10 minute flight from my credit card 😎
discover has this thing where you get more money for your rewards if you get a gift card
Tragic that yall don't have culvers
Bro wtf is your username
if you have history with chase, they're really giving with initial limits, particularly if you don't start with the student card
we do its just a decently far drive
I don't even have a license
You probably won't see me going many places outside of campus even if we have free public transportation
its not so bad tbh
math majorsâ˜¹ï¸
You mean â€œmath majors 🥳â€
math??
Damn math majors really be trying to convert people every chance they get
id have to drop out if i majored in math
Also, math club meetings have free food, and as a college student when I heard the phrase â€œfree foodâ€ I was already a sworn math major by the time I heard the first word
am quite weak at math
math sucks imo
I don't hate math, math hates me and it's okay
i hate everything else
I wish that you sneeze in your next drink
you dont like stats?
well sucks for them stats is peak
Oh those I forgot ab that
Why did so many people join the server in the last day or so what happened lmao
Yes converting to math = bad
😭 what about Charlie and Michael though
Surprisingly there are more math majors here rn than nursing majors
oh dear
That's way more than we have math majors
this discord is just nursing majors then math majors then others
See I'm quite surprised because it's really like nursing and CS which are the big ones, yet somehow math is small but strong
I think the beef between math majors and nursing majors just makes them the loudest
and half the time they were broken
there was a time when i lived in sophomore housing that all of the washers in the building were broken and then we only had one if we were lucky for the last half of the spring semester
they all broke right before spring break 😍
idk how many clarke has
the worst part about spring break tho is that you donâ€™t have access to any residence hall but your own
So you couldn't even borrow someone else's washing machine smh
but that was during break. i think they broke like the thursday before spring break
and they would gaslight us and tell us the one was working but it would actually have an error with the spin cycle and leave clothes drenched
Anatomy-loving people - I just learned that warm blood clots faster than cold blood, so itâ€™s important to keep somebody warm if theyâ€™re bleeding a bunch
bc im guessing nursing students will be wanting to get those completely sanitized asap
dont nursing students have their scrubs washed in non-residential washers provided by the unviersity or nursing school?
im able to log into sis now
I know the case engineering server technically has a full name policy but if you put Red and then your last name I am sure they will accept it. They don't know what your id says. They just want to prevent spam. 

You could also probably DM a mod about it if you didn't want to post it publicly
Ya I did it like 9am on Thursday morning bc I didnâ€™t have classes
Apparently not. 
I think you need to use the discord campus hub to join
the fact that i can't even access it... :welp:
Ainâ€™t no way
Oh sorry I used the exact same words as Matthew but just reordered
sigh

Bad citation style itâ€™s me u should be citing

you arent drawing a sandwich
I would've taken that job too
If they responded not 3 months late
they dont deserve you
having to hit word counts is gonna suck
But beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Usually I hate hitting word counts but sometimes
If I find enough on the topic I might go over
There's limits to that though
My DE history teacher wanted a 10 page paper on a historical movie
I'm not writing a 10 page paper for history
History when being the worst subject is a contest
Like I've hit 8-9-10 pages before but that was for English it's a whole different thing
Star Wars, Shawn of the dead, anything studio ghibli, last train to busan
I didnâ€™t know people actually lived in Indiana, thatâ€™s news to me
You will never believe that I am on the Wikipedia page for the Amish right now
pennsylvania is not a midwestern state wtf
not really no
i mean ig??? i wouldn't know what pa culture looks like but in my brain midwest is endless fields and a shit ton of corn
And a math major I know
Why sad??
True (you hate freshman clearly smh 🤦â€â™‚ï¸ )
having to spend 1400 isnt very
Because a top 3 CWRU student hobby is sharing awful stories from high school
It went all over
Even though this law firm has been getting everyone into lawsuits and is ubiquitously hated
Awww so wholesome family traditional values 🥰
So, my school board voted to take on this law firm (in addition to the one that they already have) and make kids feel crazy unsafe
Theyâ€™re also spending a fuck ton of money on new athletic shit too for some reason
My choir was falling apart when I left and I thought it was just sad but then I saw a spicy email implying that the school district is intentionally trying to destroy the programs
Not just neglecting them, actively working to harm them
as an athlete i hate turf
its objectively worse to play on
School districts 2e-8 seconds after you graduate
i dont get the obsession
i dont even play sports and i hate turf where is the grass????
Why not get hurt more when you fall
especially if its bad turf
I just have no idea where theyâ€™re getting the money
i think turf should go die and grass should be used like the earth intended
Especially after the inevitable lawsuits thereâ€™ll be nothing left
No more school
There are already 6 school districts in this county for 100,000 total residents, thereâ€™s no reason kids here couldnâ€™t just go to Gettysburg
My school probably wont even exist anymore when i graduate
I mean if you canâ€™t see it, how can you prove that it exists?
Guess where I went to school
Maybe it already doesnt exist anymore
Blud hates his town so much he would rather be in Ohio 💀
I know, scary
Youâ€™re a math major you can just assume it does
oh shit
I cant see any problems with cleveland city schools at all tbh
We have a wet and dry season type of climate, so weâ€™ve gone entire winters with barely any rain, and winters where the creek rises 20 feet in a week!!!
Holy shit thatâ€™s a lot of money
Yeah and im sure that one of the solutions will just be closing my school since we only have ~250 students and theyre already cutting teachers
That did not send the way it was supposed to whoops
I dont think i can make a school with a 2 billion dollar endowment have a deficit but i can try
Like genuinely worse
This summer there have been no bad fires yet in CA! Letâ€™s Hope This Trend Continues!
Alex donâ€™t do it
dont do it alex i like case
choose arson not killing schools
I donâ€™t even know what this is referencing tbh
Damn which I got that aiqs option
OH
Jschlatt? Iâ€™ve heard of him ofc but Iâ€™ve never seen his face
Be scared because I have a single â€¦
No roommate will still spawn
Adam dont make me buy a second schlanket just for you
Alr down back I canâ€™t compete
gonna spend 8 hrs in a car
Well I donâ€™t see any curve
Ikr prove me wrong 🤯🤬
no the real question is why are we trying so hard to investigate space when we have  unexplored ocean
i think theyre trying to hide something
Big ocean doesnâ€™t want u to find out
â€œClevelandâ€ residents having to drive 17 1/2 hours to get to campus â€¦
def hiding something i dont trust those eyes
Ice breakers and stuff outside were not bad and everyone was pretty chill
My worst fear is being dumped into a large room and being forced to talk to people
Oh shit true, so I need to make friends in order to show them how cool I am
Iâ€™ll make so many math majors
kept the cup tho
Smart, I gave that away unfortunately
I do have the fanny pack tho
Wise advice from someone at a boarding school
Red flag if they donâ€™t tbh
Yes (Iâ€™ve never had conflict with any of my 4 roommates)
Cries in public school
cries in public school with u
i had a few friends who had really bad experiences
Friend had to sleep in the math classroom for a year
i would get kicked out of the hallway for eating lunch in the hall with my friends when the choir room was closed
My school made the set up be upper class men and low class men
choir room 😦 they started closing it on wednesdays so if the other music rooms were closed too we'd just be in the hall
damn
I mean was it really hs if there wasnâ€™t one?
thats not as bad i guess?
hated having her for english 10 tho bc she changed the curriculum from farenheit 451 to some other book
Isnâ€™t that a British YouTuber
â€œNow I become death, destroyer of worlds.â€ - Oppenheimer if he created AI
Medicine isn't even real you just gotta balance your humours
you just want to bloodlet
Crazy how much it costs without aid
That number doesn't include aid
i thought something went wrong
Last years orientation schedule for reference
you pay the same amount as far as I know, it's just a longer timeline
I hope I get to sell my PC eventually
need to get a new mobo/cpu/etc next summer (ideally now but no time) and ive been trying to figure out what to do with the parts
"Hey Siri, how hot is it outside?" - my mother
"It is currently cloudy and 102 degrees." - her phone
Yeah I'm probably gonna have to sell my PC for parts
But one of the fans is broken and it has overheating issues
So I can't really just sell it like a normal pc
I have no idea what my pc is even rly worth though
Where can you find this?
honestly I never had them around the house so the only time Iâ€™ve really had em recently is during exam periods at my old school
wtf do they not have them on the west coast
Didnâ€™t you know they are
i cant disagree with this
nutella is better solo tho
cant really combine
I mean all of it makes me feel bad but itâ€™s worth it sometimes
D: dont dunk on it till youve tried it
No I didnâ€™t eat breakfast freshman year
fair
Early
idk I'll probably try to keep granola bars or something on me so I don't completely miss breakfast
oh?
Spanish shows up for me and then I know people who have math or chemistry
It doesn't really mean much at the moment but its exciting for sure
i keep checking canvas bc i really want my sci fi syllabus but nothing :(
the aliens don't want you to discover them yet
damn
woke up too late
lol i woke up like an hour early in a cold sweat bc i thought i was gonna wake up late
still didnt get one of the classes i wanted tho
so iâ€™ve had my one chem class since i registered for classes 3 months ago and nothing else
damn adn we only had to sign up for like 1 or 2 classes too 😧
exactly it was not even that rough, I am just lucky Im nursing bc I do not think Id be cut out for the stress of class registration for practically any other major
wasnâ€™t too bad
esp bc half of the exams were the same morning
because i do not need it for my degree
i thought ppl only did p/np if they were like failing cuz it looks worse? idk
no it doesnâ€™t
you shouldnâ€™t withdraw unless youâ€™re getting a D or worse
math 308, i might be getting rid of my math major 😔
oh
do u still need to retake the class if u p/np
if you need it for your degree
and it can't count for breadth that way
but i just need this class for credits
What happened 😢😔😭😿
i can also just take the math classes i wanted to without the major so i might do that
Imagine being able to eat Nutella
Why can't you
Damn that's tragic
I feels like it's "tickly" if that makes sense
You saw what happened to Michael did you not
But I guess I didn't do that for long enough 😔
I straight up didnâ€™t notice
It wouldnâ€™t change for us unless we left the chat
Haha even the mod canâ€™t do anything about it
What can I say teamwork is the dream work
go head man
They might just not know or it doesnâ€™t come up in convo
But still like all the people Iâ€™ve atleast known for a few years or even family where it wouldve come up eventually youd think atleast one would be
I guess germ cells don't always take half of the chromosomes
Just a guess though
how would that even work
But sometimes in duplication the arms of the chromosome donâ€™t fully separate and one cell gets 2 copies
reminder to be mindful of ur internet footprint kids you could end up like alex
I mean atleast thereâ€™s nothing wrong with them, theyre just bad cuz i was 13
Aaaah I donâ€™t want that!
I legit wanted to see how long it would be before someone called me out on it
I mean you werenâ€™t wrong
SEE I KNEW PEOPLE WERE LIKE ME AND JUST DIDNT CALL IT OUT
I noticed it weeks ago, but didn't mention it...
... it has not yet been weeks bestie
10 = 14 = weeks
Math!
Damn
sure, you can lose to a fortified trebuchet point
Yeah Matthew I think if you want to engage the engineers, trying to fight them is not the play
They lose the moral battle
me when i know people who work  as engineers for both of these companies 👁ï¸👁ï¸
(i havenâ€™t spoken to her in years)
oh
she doesnâ€™t work for a controversial engineering company
Damn bro stop swearing
I will fall back in line though
I was just about to make that same joke wtf
I will if i take a couple too many silly math classes
I changed my nickname 10 days ago and only today did someone call me out
Yâ€™allâ€™s usernames are boring, get to my level
i donâ€™t think there are enough classes offered at this university that would result in this
Some are probably offered rarely enough though
Who needs graduation, just stay in college forever
Damn I wanna be an Adam major that sounds fun
Grad school grindset
Iâ€™m just never gonna have a real job
Holy shit
Guys what if we have a competition for who stays in college the longest for just one more funny math class
We love math class
i could have graduated a semester early with just one extra class per semester. but who wants to bother
I never even noticed the car in your pfp
Graduating early is lame because then no time for silly math classes
I could graduate a semester early EASILY but then I would have a semester to kill before grad school, so ...
MATH 401/402 and PHYS 331/332 it is 😎
Do bs/ms graduate a semester early for your bs and get your ms the next semester
If I were going into the industry then I would have applied for the BS/MS last semester
See youre being too logical here, dont you want to be a *master* of mathematics
Sadly for you itâ€™s the math + physics combined major, so not quite
I'm already taking the requisite coursework anyway so I don't really see a point
I feel like Iâ€™ll already end up taking a bunch of graduate classes anyways
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (fair choice tbh) NOOOOOOOOOOO
this is only really necessary if you donâ€™t really have much quality research experience
If you're starting off at Calc III, you could easily be taking graduate classes by your junior or even sophomore year
Iâ€™m considerably farther ahead in math than physics
The other CWRU I can think of is if grad school apps don't work the way you want them to so you get a master's somewhere and then transfer elsewhere later hoping it will work out better
PhDs arenâ€™t necessarily the smartest people, theyâ€™re the ones who followed all the steps
You mean ... you didn't start doing research in 10th grade? Honestly don't even bother applying to grad school, it's over
bc the majority of students do research. i felt inadequate with my amount of experience (ill have 4 semesters and a summer when i graduate) but i compare myself to people from my HS who are applying to graduate school and i have so much more
No sorry I also wasnâ€™t a math Olympiad + physics Olympiad champion at 8
Welp was nice knowing you guys, guess i dont belong here
I was my class treasurer, soâ€¦â€¦. At least I can count money?
Yo wtf just happened
but if you want to be a professor itâ€™s important to go to a top ranked school for grad school. grad school admissions is more about getting the research experience and having good relationships with faculty more than being a perfect candidate
and if youâ€™re not putting out quality applications they wonâ€™t accept you
rankings and acceptance rates for grad school are very tricky and not often available bc cohorts are so small for a given program
grad school admissions are so scary
because iâ€™m like. they other love me or they hate me
not as scary as med school admissions 😳 good luck to any premeds in the audience
A gut feeling of mine
I mean you donâ€™t already have a PhD so why would they accept you
i just know i donâ€™t have to take the GRE 🙏🙏
At least in my field I donâ€™t have to work in a physical lab lmao cope and seethe
Me probably failing the one serious lab I have to take
a postdoc at my work didnâ€™t get into any grad schools the first time around and then got two consecutive postdocs at the space telescope science institute (somewhat high profile in astronomy since they run webb and hubble)
true and i probably will!! just hoping i can avoid filling out forms 💀 is there a a specific due date on housing accommodations requests?
cause also the dorms can get pretty warm in the winter with the heating and thereâ€™s no real way to regulate it and esp with living on the 11th floorâ€¦ i personably donâ€™t how it would be but it would probably be useful to put in for one, not just for the few weeks the weather is hot
cold >>>>
shoutout to storrs 414 for having a working thermostat
question - do i need to buy a parking pass to park my car somewhere relatively long term? it doesnt really matter to me if its a bit of a walk from my dorm cause I'm not gonna use it often. it says it's like $3 a day which seems like a bit much
I don't have a car
yes. Definitely need a parking pass for long term parking. Sucks that that's the way it is, but yeah
and my parents dont wanna drive all the way to come pick me up
and then you can figure out your needs as well
~~cause I'm pretty sure they didn't expect me to read the lease~~
Yep just gotta suck it up and pay
Fuck it immq do bicycles
Donâ€™t you have to select at least 4 options?
Also if you need additional factor and didnâ€™t see it yet, the individual options show slightly different times
For better or worse they donâ€™t list professors and personally Iâ€™m not enough of a super sleuth or care enough to Sherlock Homes that one out
I hope irs not too bad
Im kinda scared for it
I used rate my
Professor on every class Iâ€™m scared of not knowing
But what calms me at least for some reason is that even if you try to seek out all the information and do all you can to plan out college, your classes or whatever you can never guarantee a certain outcome so it is what it is
But that might actually be distressing so I really donâ€™t mean to make it worse
you may be able to guess based on past course offerings
a sages class i took was very popular and it stopped being offered when the professor left the university
sophomores donâ€™t live in the village unless in greek housing
and theyâ€™re trying to get sophomores out of stj
and even so there are only a few sophomore suites in stj this year (to my knowledge)
Arenâ€™t the two new buildings second year dorms?
This entire website just seems like a way to get more money out of me
just buy from amazon when u need stuff
Yeah universal college thing: don't buy from the university bookstore what you can get elsewhere. It's expensive.
but theyâ€™re doubles so u have to unfortunately deal with that unless u have an accommodation
they have AC and wood floors tho
i rly feel like
considering my room is required to have fucking strobe lights
oh r u deaf
I ended up getting a single like 5 days before I moved in
Bc I realized it would be a huge inconvenience to my roommate
is going to feel with having a strobe light in their room
I mean Iâ€™m fine dealing with a double for two years, the stj apartments look sick
I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll care
STJ is hard to get I think
Nope
Itâ€™s loud as hell so I think the strobe lights wonâ€™t really be much more bothersome
Oh wdym
from someone whos been in a boarding school for 2 years its not that bad unless you get actual demon spawn as your roommate
This means itâ€™s the whole residence hall will have strobe lights
I don't think it means that for the door knocker no
Oh I wonder how that accommodation goes over if someone has epilepsy in the same building 😭
I'm more interested in the door knocker cause if ur not deaf that's gotta get old insanely fast
Someone knocks and you just see fuckin
Idk u probably register with disability services if u have regular seizures anyways so they prob know
I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be that bad but if u r rly worried about it u can request a single
They prob won't give me a gih single that's supposed to be for the RA or something iirc so
Ya prob not unfortunately
they might be able to get a first floor one which is the closest they can get to gih without being in gih
so axel, opinions on math?
Wtf why are there 2 of you
Math good
oh fosho
anyways adam ive decided im going to quit math
Donâ€™t you love math tho
Okay, Alex who has suddenly stopped using capitalization while typing
You know what this server needs more of
I think every serving needs a ||r/hutchingscirclejerk||
any kind mods want to uphold democracy
(fair enough)
You dont have to call it that, but another mod can
kinda lame
left me hanging fr
Car
car >>>>> shat house
I feel like that scene at the end of spirited away
when chihiro has to guess which pigs are the actual parents and then the glamour comes off the bouncing heads
I mean who doesnt
too hard
I only saw one of them when I was 7 years old, and I can't even remember which one it was 😭
Iâ€™ve only seen spirited awayâ€¦. And I think I bit of Howls moving castle
SHIT I FORGOT THE BOY AND THE HERON
Iâ€™ve got bad memories associated with getting my acceptance lol
happy cry
I was just chilling at home when i got mine, nothing fun
lame
damn i got deferred from case over winter break so applied to two schools on christmas 😭
Now the school i was rejected from i got the letter in my calc class and some of my friends there were sad with me
bc i had said im done college apps if i get into case but then i didnâ€™t and then the first downtime i had after the letter was christmas
they almost didn't have soap
Mine was just my gf at the time being there and being super not happy for me / making me feel bad about it
they gave me money rd so i donâ€™t hold it against them too much
fair
Can't be ungirlfriended if I can't get a girlfriend :DD
Mine was already in college (a year older then me) in PA and was mad that I was â€œleaving herâ€ and got crazy jealous
oh 🙁  damn
respect for that many apps tho
Same I applied to 1 other school
I think I applied to 6 total but I didnâ€™t really want to go to any of those places
If I got rejected from case id never hear the end of it from my sisters
I wouldâ€™ve thought about Pitt more if their honors college stuff had come out earlier
the study spaces: study body ratio was bad
Maybe for grad school tho 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
Very important that the student body is weird and abnormal!!!
yeah if theres no hvz, quiditch, sci marathon, benis snow art outside kcl, squirrel hunt, lego club, d1 ultimate frisbee, mario kart, ||higher asd concentration|| idk what id do
If I hadnâ€™t have gotten into case I probably would have gone for Penn State and just sucked it up and dealt with the fact that you literally have to take busses to get to and from class in less than an hour
whats scary
Good thing you didnt
To lead them away from our parents.
oh and there were racoons
Whats wrong with raccoons?
PSU has cat-sized squirrels tho
they just need a drawbridge and moat
you are forgetting there was a pet racoon in my dorm last year
If i didnt get in to case there would have been a good chance i ended up in colorado
school of the mines?
Iâ€™ve never been off the East Coastâ€¦â€¦
no you just havent been to oregon
I need culvers but mother says no
Its very sad
We need one in the city
Idk
Youâ€™re just wrong
Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t want to spend millions of dollars on an apartment
You donâ€™t have to out in the sticks here
Dont need the 11 floor prison
Y'all want a waffle House internship â‰ï¸
Iâ€™m scared of even going to waffle houses ngl
Never had it
There arenâ€™t even any around me, you have to go into Maryland at least
Hannah been my opp since before we even got on campus
never
You could learn this from math! Consider the group S_4 of all permutations of 4 letter strings
Yeah. Can comfortably solve 2x2 and 3x3. Donâ€™t know parity algs for 4x4 but can solve them.
4x4 is the worst tho
4x4 is so fun I just hate oll parity with all of my heart
Question - Iâ€™m trying to get in touch with a professor, but they havenâ€™t answered my initial email nor my follow-up. Would it help to ask my advisor for help in contacting them?
Which professor are you trying to reach?
Uh, $9? domains are cheap if they aren't desirable
that looks like the background color of my personal website, but i don't see any issues right now showing up
were you trying to access my minecraft sniping service blog page? i see a 400 for the database fetch
I don't think so
but yet rerunning the request succeeds
your worst nightmare
so annoying
I clicker or clicker from the last of us
Ouch
Certain professors do not like modern technology and still use these old devices for in class polls
Maybe in quantity, but we still have a taller peak than Colorado does \:-)
Yeah I found some images it looks sick
Are you really trying to North-Carolina-splain mountains to a West Coaster?
i emailed a prof i am on great terms with but he never responded - profs usually dont check emails unless theyre teaching a class or are involved with some sort of research
Earth (CA)
Water (East Coast)
Fire (CA)
Air (Iowa)
weren't the fire nation the bad guys?
omg so right
there are separate ones for dorm buildings though
To study and profs cant schedule classes
3 weeks!
even wilder, I may or may not be studying in the teletubies house rn
God I need to get my shit together I'm not even done getting dorm stuff ready
Ugh I need to get my stuff together too
you just need sheets and a towel tbh
I mean theres still amazon and stores anyways
I have a bit of a problem where Iâ€™m obsessed with having random books with me (that I donâ€™t really read and wonâ€™t need for like a year) and Iâ€™m trying to figure out if I want to bring them for gits and shiggles
Michael you say this clearly not having seen Adam's Math Library (I brought many many math books)
This is my last halloween in college I wanna ball out
If thereâ€™s not already trick or treating weâ€™ve got to do something
i dunno man i think i could pass for a high schooler
idk i hate being in cars so i donâ€™t tend to enjoy road trips
I feel like the day a math/nursing major joins this server is the day the ecosystem collapses
its physically impossible to do a math and nursing major
all gen ed reqs mean we need to take all non stem classes for the 5ish slots we have
its really only posible to mayybe minor in public health, psych, or a language
Theoretically if you test out of every lower div math class, it leaves you with 6 math classes you HAVE to take
Maybe you can whine and beg to get the math department to count some nursing stuff as electives, but I honestly doubt it
no they want us to humanities real bad
yeah esp bc thwing is closed rn
summer hours
I hate that place
booo they all say in union boo thwing
Has the UMB office which is pretty cozy and I really like Athenian meetings which happen there
Nice. Iâ€™m too scared to but I def see the appeal
as long as you donâ€™t get upset at people for accidentally waking you up bc theyâ€™re having meetings or just hanging out no one cares
I donâ€™t really nap/sleep in public if I can avoid it itâ€™s just a personal preference
god i miss umbo
Iâ€™ve done plenty of linear algebra homework on Fridays in that room while Peppa Pig in alternate languages plays on the tv because Ashley exists
couldnâ€™t hang out there past the time the building closed at the end of the semester
iâ€™ve missed multiple stats lectures bc i slept on the couches
iâ€™m not going to miss any of my classes this semester bcâ€¦ well
Rip Yost Hall couches
i have 3 classes in a row on tuesdays and thursdays and my other days i have work before and after class
My process for that goes about as follows:
Step 1. Guess x ln x looks about right
Step 2. d/dx (x ln x) = ln x + 1
Step 3. x ln x - x + C is the right answer
Step 4. QED
Just how i was taught idk
Actually solving it correctly this time, i dont think theres anything wrong with doing it this way, just unnecessary
Me when my school caps at precalc so I have no idea what I'm looking at
It's math shitposting, even if you did have calc it would still be nonsensical
itâ€™s not your department itâ€™s the one you want to work in
i want to work in wherever will give me a job
im just gonna leave most of it blank i guess
scott doesnt provide traditionall syballu
it doesnt have the like. week by week kinda stuff but i hope itll still help a bit :0
i have the week by week schedule for his class
Omg
Might fuck around again 🤐
Have any of you math majors or other people heard of the 24 game
No but you did just lose the game unfortunately :(
I think so? Unless I'm thinking of the wrong thing
5*5-1 and then I throw the last 5 away :)
it was 10.10 then went to 11.11 and is now 12.22
Arenâ€™t we supposed to submit our forms in person though
Oh I know people who had her - I didnâ€™t but she seems nice
Nope
||(5-(1/5))*5 tricky cuz you have to make a fraction which just seems wrong||
oh elegant
Adam enjoys giving questions that are possible to answer unfortunately
Anyone want a fun math problem?????
except hayley
You dont need to know what it is to solve it
||a quick observation without proof yields that it should be n=18. The work would all be induction showing that the coefficient in front of the term of all cosines is the sum of the first m squares (beginning at m=1)||
||tested on the first 4 or so terms, noticed a pattern, plugged the pattern in to OEIS. Got a reasonable sounding answer. Don't want to do the tedious algebra for the induction||
Who says itâ€™s not that simple even if y isnt x
I just donâ€™t want to think about it right now tbh
I just got the same result without doing it by the Internet
Stop cheating with our fun math problems
I hate algebra right now adam and i don't have a paper with me
Cheater forgot the +C
my bad
Well Jake maybe you should stop being a physicist and having the Internet do math for you
doing an integral is computation and I am more than happy to have a computer do computation for me. I find the most joy in logic-ing through proofs not just computing the ideas behind them
Iâ€™m too tired rn to participate 😭
I feel like ive seen this one before
youâ€™re just mad that physicists are right about this one
(using your resources to do your math)

Guys ngl Iâ€™m kinda scared I overloaded myself fall semester
Iâ€™m wondering if I should drop a class
That doesnâ€™t seem too bad honestly
It could be rough. Use add/drop and Freshman forgiveness and donâ€™t be afraid to drop a class
with aiqs tho thatâ€™s a lot
it really depends on the professor
probably 214 or 105 but you wonâ€™t want to drop either of those
you donâ€™t really interact with the professors of lab classes
Damn
Iâ€™m so sick of Chem pop quizzes my hs Chem teacher loved Doing them
I dont know if he will do the same pop quizzes for you but I assume they will be mixed around
But like how do you study for them LOL
like in the prelab class ur basically just attending a lecture where sturtz explains what you do in the lab and the concepts u need to know
Ohh ok so they canâ€™t be that bad then
july 31, another day of no news about finaid, however, I have emailed them
Unfortunately Rockwell I'm a freshman
i need to submit it to get my visa for my study abroad program like i cant keep waiting for you to suddenly feel like doing it 🫠
I got my aiqs assignment, not sure if everyone else did cuz i just happened to check sis and saw it but
like as someone who got a 4 on lang and lit should i be able to treat it as a blow off class or will it require a decent amount of energy
Ofc the aiqs I get is the one that makes my schedule the worst 😭😭
Not anymore
Not anymore!
oh god i thought i was going crazy bc mine was a lighter purple
were you waiting for someone to notice
it means you donâ€™t question authority
Canâ€™t disprove it either
trying to get my screen time down
by punishing myself if i exceed an hour (i made an arbitrary point system and i lose points for too much tiktok usage)
Iâ€™m hoping to go cold turkey on most social media for the school year
i didnt even have instagram until earlier this year TT
iâ€™ve increased my instagram screen time because i started watching reels when i run out of tiktok time but the two combined (when i donâ€™t ignore my limits) arenâ€™t as bad as my tiktok habit used to be
I dont have to big of a problem tiktok/reels my problem is watching several hour long youtube videos even though im well aware it will steal a portion of my day
HEY! Vsauce. Michael (Math + Physics '28) here. What is an "integral"? You might say it's a linear operator on a function space. But I know what it really is: it is an approximation that I do on my computer.
Or is it?
iâ€™ve maintained pretty good grades with a social life and jobs and a tiktok addiction but i donâ€™t want to keep that up next semester bc ill be very busy
idk how i function tbh
Iâ€™m so hyped for next semester last semester was hell
no matter what happens ill never succumb to tik tok
Classes + internship + TAing + doing my service hours for phi psi
Good, donâ€™t
So hyped to going back to doing only school shit
me when my greek org died and it was my biggest commitment and i decided to take on several more in response
except now i get my sunday afternoons to myself
Rip
I donâ€™t go to chapter anyways lmao
Itâ€™s not a class you can just blow off, but itâ€™s not super difficult either. Some of it depends on the prof, but you should expect to have a little bit of reading due every class and the grading of the essays depends on prof but they are all good writers and will expect to see improvement in your writing
💀 nah facebook adding shorts has done terrible things for my parents social media time
I saw my old boomer neighbor fall for AI slop on facebook it made me so sad
Oh dear lord

The job market has been in decline for years. With the impact of COVID more and more businesses are beginning to restructure and make previously stable positions redundant. Managing your portfolio and making sound investments is more important now than ever before. I have been trying to figure out how to manage my $700,000 portfolio, but have been having trouble.
What about the high school freshman who is trying to speedrun a life of being a LinkedIn influencer

Bro is the reason we will now own an air fryer
tho lowkey i didnâ€™t even know everyone which is why i was so flabbergasted by the bid 💀
Didnâ€™t wanna call u out lmao
maybe i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m talking about tho
didnâ€™t help that i was at physics si sessions during all the recruitment stuff 💀
Really big and really small chapters get weird with that tho
I cant find her anywhere on rate my professor
Some professors wonâ€™t be on RMP because they havenâ€™t taught much or at all before
Omg that scares me
Itâ€™s fine, Iâ€™ve had new professors before and I havenâ€™t had any problems
Unfortunately I have NO MONEY
Some are labeled work study
oh shit okay
Working there sounds cool even tho I'd never get a job there
at the same time i havent even set up a linkedin, so while some are on the grind, im not even in the game
donâ€™t buy books unless the prof requires it
Holy shit no way
I found you a while ago 😭 just never hit connect
You told him to ignore it yet show excitement, lying to my face
Oh SHIT it does say that doesn't it
adam you realize thereâ€™s an inadvertent face reveal here right
If anyone wants to find me theyâ€™ve always been able to
i mean i havenâ€™t been skirting out of a face reveal like adam has
if you can, buy it used from someone older
How does that even work
how do you find someone though
well unfortunately wolf (guy who was posting here a while ago) bought them off of everyone he could in my class to resell, his little scheme is probably the best way for yall to get them cheaper than new, but i can send an invite to the 27 server if anyone wants to ask people there
You could find me if you wanted to
Iâ€™m not impossible to find
I love that I will never need an iclicker
Idk
I'm CS and never had to
chem 105 and 111 are the main classes that need it
I would even go so far as to dub you with the dreaded "Dweebus"

I think you can use an app subscription for some profs on your phone but idk if Drew meyer likes that
@eekhannah I donâ€™t know how neurosciency this is, but why is it that when smell is messed up after COVID or whatever, itâ€™s almost always making smells worse (like burning or chemically) instead of pleasant?
idk dude i donâ€™t study viruses
Well like if you have a stroke you often also smell burning so I assume the phenomenon of altered smells usually being worse is not unique to COVID
itâ€™s not something they really teach about in undergrad unless itâ€™s something you do research in. my research doesnâ€™t have to do with the olfactory system
lost bout 90% of my ability to smell from covid
i wish i could capture that feeling all the time
How are you getting here early???
I think you can drop stuff in ur room early but can't sleep there early
Idk tho
Leave it so something really heavy leans against the door as you close it so your roommate is unable to enter
I mean i wont need the second bed frame so i can use that
OR stick a chair under the door handle so it can't turn
Oh no
I actually didn't have to deal with any bad parents
None of them really stand out in my memory as specific stories, just the standard annoyances
I guess I was hella lucky
Iâ€™m aware, just means i can hunt you down instead of moving my stuff in
They grow up so fast *wipes away tear*
It feels like only yesterday Sophie and Matthew were talking in German
It feels like only yesterday I was just meeting Charlie
And then I recognized you in my calc 3 class
Anyway, I best be going, I need to be awake in about 7 hours to take notes on bird behavior
What happens when you need to hit the john?
why didnâ€™t we do that last year
lowkey had that feeling about my bf. he was like emphasized background character yknow
Adam really is that NPC in a video game that you become really attached to. He doesn't create enough drama or have like a really broad character arc (at least when I've known him) to be like a stereotypical "main character" he's just a good guy who's there when you need him
fuck all the other adams adam goodman is my adam
But I donâ€™t know the other Adam so yk
he graduated so you wonâ€™t </3
I told him "adam, you can't lick powerlines it's not good for you" and he said "fuck you zach this is what I am passionate about. I'm gonna lick power lines until the day I die"
dead

math major moment
Fake math major (can count higher than 3)
I see a math hater typing in the chat
Was just gonna say this could qualify me as a math major
Itâ€™s a good thing Iâ€™m not a math major because I can only count to four
Something I ainâ€™t reading
Idk, exec tries new things every year. But we should do it this coming year 👀
idk bro i dont remember what i ate for lunch today
had never heard of him before then
yeah but i dont get it much
why is sis always having problems what 😭
Different perspective of car
me when i have to move all of my belongings by hand over a 15 hour period (just down the street tho)
Idk though Iâ€™m not exactly sure
Ugh bc I asked on Reddit about this professor I got that I canâ€™t find any I fo on on rmp
would this be weird though like would it give a bad impression
just can't lead with that
RIP Ed Sheeran 🕊ï¸🕊ï¸🕊ï¸🕊ï¸

does anyone know how I should pay my balance in sis if outside scholarships havent been added yet?
I don't think they store that information. just do your best
The average grade doesn't matter imo. It'll only encourage you to be pessimistic or complacent, which are both bad things to be in class
Oh wow it's only two weeks
Ain't no way that was an entire 104 days of summer vacation
Oh yeah that its going great ||i havent watched in months||
"don't be this like Kate" okay storage scholars
Don't be like this Kate -- find cheaper storage elsewhere!
you donâ€™t need the 105 textbook
you made me lose the game wtf
@michael_cjr want to do an integral?
Is this problem just from a screenshot of my calc 3 homework from last semester? Maybe
Ignore the bars on the outside, I guess that doesnâ€™t work on mobile
A number i cant comprehend because its bigger than 3
How do you find x and y?
Is there just some step Iâ€™m missing
Consider this as an analogy: how do you find x?
I see, I just did them in the wrong order
I honestly believe that a lot of math and physics courses could be combined
This is a terrible idea 😭😭😭
Dude at this point Iâ€™m just doing the arithmetic wrong ugh
Truly a math major when you lose the ability to do simple arithmetic
I literally messed up on the multiplication, kill me now
Calc III in 2 minutes:
Integration over multiple variables: exactly as you did.
Differentiation over multiple variables: d/dx of some expression of x, y, and z: y and z are constants.
Vector field: function which assigns an arrow to each point in space
Div: how much a vector field is pointing away from somewhere. Grad: the direction of uphill. Curl: the axis a vector field is spinning around.
Path integral: in a vector field, follow a path. How much do the arrows point in the same direction as you move?
Green's theorem: if you have a surface, the integral of the curl over the whole thing (how much "total spin" there is, so to speak) is the same as the path integral around the edge, because all the neighboring spins cancel out except for the ones on the edge pushing you around.
Also, if you have a 3D volume, the integral of the div (how much "total outward flow" there is) is how much the arrows at the surface point outward. Because if you want to see how much total outward flow there is, you can either look at how much the vectors point outward at each point, OR the total amount of arrows pointing outward from the surface.
This is MATH 223 compressed into one message
@jschlanket I took it way long ago, did I miss anything big
Ig I called the whole thing Green's Theorem though
||I technically never learned stokes theorem||
i didnâ€™t either nor did i learn any curl stuff
I taught myself calc 1 and 2, my school didnâ€™t have ap calc and I wanted to get ahead
i donâ€™t understand how everyone is teaching themselves stuff left and right i could never
I do because i did all my calc 3 hw ahead of time and taught myself everything and then saw the prof remove those questions from the homework assignments and then say he wasnt gonna go over it 🥲
Bruh big rip
i actually hate wikipedia
Lame
i guess i occasionally go down rabbit holes for other stuff
just never systematically enough to like teach myself calculus or whatever
i think this is 90% formatting though
My math journey was hella weird
the rest is, i think, that i had a lot of trouble understanding wikipedia when i was younger and emotionally that fear of it being too confusing is still there, and also i feel like thereâ€™s often a bunch of info i donâ€™t care about before i get to the stuff i do want to know
I went from geometry to calc 1, but i was also still doing ib math so i learned algebra 2 and pre calc while doing calc 1
Yeah my school didnâ€™t have IB (or much of anything for that matter) and I didnâ€™t really know that I wanted to do stem until like the end of sophomore year so I had to cram a bit
We also never went over what the jacobian was and then he put a double integral on an exam that required it
Ooh I just looked it up and in MATH 322 the professor just called it "the derivative"
Which I guess is totally fair
yeah idk
DAMN
Man idc if it's for the school if I'm doing any kind of coding job I shouldn't be getting paid $10 an hour 😭
I have some bad news for you

yes objectively bad
The tornado is in Pharma (cleveland suburb) moving southeast so opposite direction
but still am on lowest building floor â„¢ï¸
id much rather be melting from heat than tornado weather
how bad is it over there
The wind chilled out, but not too bad earlier just some trashcans knocked over and trees swaying
ah thats not too bad
my friends back in cleveland are making it seem a lot worse
hopefully its gone before tmr
Yes, donâ€™t do that🌪ï¸
its supposed to rain in columbus later today
iâ€™m supposed to go to an outdoor concert tn 😃
if it gets cancelled iâ€™m not bugging too much cause ill get my money back but still
itâ€™s like an hour drive and it would suck to drive through the weather and have to turn around if it gets canceled
idk where it is
Woah bellflower is closed because of a downed powerline
As a Californian I am slightly scared lmao
CSDS 310 (Algorithms) is taught by Orhan Ozguner and Mehmet Koyuturk, PHYS 310 (Classical Mechanics) is taught by Michael Martens, and MATH 310 (Classical Matrix Groups) was taught by Elizabeth Meckes. Does that answer your question, Jake?
Nope none on the east coast that I know of

i can never eat any mexican food again
California "storm" (it rained lightly for an hour a couple days ago and has been the first rain since school let out)
No still in PA, probably the same system
as a californian I don't feel ready for cleveland precipitation
Its okay, the winter will only probably be pretty bad this year
In terms of it could rain for a week or be sunny for two no matter what the time of year is
do they shovel the sidewalk or do we trudge in waist deep snow idk what to expect
not horrible ig
Also Garlic Noodles did you get rain late at night August 2? We did up here
Iâ€™m just wondering how widespread it was
nah I'm south bay we didn't get anything but overcast skies

maybe don't do the surgery bot
Yeah. I work there so I can definitely talk at length on this, but the summary is all the tools on the 3rd floor are self-service so you can use them at will once you know. On the 4th floor the tools either need direct supervision or training. The trainings are free though

i need it for breadth :(
is AIQS an english class
michael are you taking any math this sem?
Math 227, calc 3
oh which slot
Iâ€™ve been trying to get a spot since the very beginning
heres hoping
Thereâ€™s only one section (I think) but that would be the only one that would really work
Nope
Iâ€™ve been told that theyâ€™re trying to add more slots for 123 but I didnâ€™t get any info at the end of last week
Sorry they're being stupid and bad and dumb
I got the invite too but I don't have the mental capacity to take 123
Neat. Donâ€™t know that prof but it seems like a fun class
Did anyone else take Ap Physics E&M and wasnâ€™t able to skip it? Just curious
I never got an initial invite, and I genuinely donâ€™t understand why
I got a 4 (and never actually took the class) so Iâ€™m just doing mechanics
CWRU doesnt offer mech II and e&m II do they?
nvm i just realized i didnt scroll far down enough
I signed up for Phys 122 because half of it is going to be a refresher from senior year, but I also got an invite for phys 123â€¦ should I take it instead? I prefer mechanics topics but I feel like I want to do e&m while itâ€™s still fresh-ish
but also be prepared to work way more than you did in high school
has anyone taken the modern virtues aiq?
It seems this poor fellow was hacked \:-/
woah 350 dollars for 4 hours 🤣🤣
Ayo did someone mention real analysis
Iâ€™m gonna miss my gf cause long distance sucks but I miss my friends :(((
I like this option because then i get to leave cleveland
Idk if we will have morning or afternoon shift
I want to go first thing but they don't let us choose times this year \:(((((
I got to choose morning last year
Well Iâ€™m trying to find a shawtyâ€¦.
I am there for move in. I personally move in the day after tho cause Evil Storage Company
Mandatory for math majors, it's called MATH 324 (Intro to Complex) because math majors are too shy to ask people out so figuring out who's interested in them is some Complex Analysis
324? Lame skip the intro just dive right in with 425
Idk what the number is but thereâ€™s complex that has calc 3 as a prereq, should I just take that instead of waiting until after real analysis?
I mean you either take it this spring or spring 27, since i believe its only offered odd springs, adam can probably correct me
I'm a big math fan (idk if you noticed) and I happen to have real completed already, so I figured why not. But if you're leaning more towards physics, then it really doesn't matter
Idk, Iâ€™ll see
From Mark Meckes himself:
> Math 425: Spring 2022 and 2023; usually every 2 years in spring
So yeah since it was spring 23 and now spring 25, id guess itll stay odd springs until someone decides to change it cuz silly goofy mood
You know Krishna right? He's math and physics and well and speedran all of his math requirements
It seems like that's the math and physics meta these days ngl
Yeah Iâ€™m on track to finish all of my math stuff as soon as possible
See i want to speedrun the math requirements so i can take more math classes that arent requirements
I don't know if you have to take scicomp
Not for math + physics, just computational physics (which looks hella fun)
Iâ€™d most likely do abstract, idk if I want physics-based group theory to be all I get
I sat in on 401 last year, I joined halfway through so I was lost but it was SO COOL
Except I want to take some of the numerical classes
Adam doesnt like numerical
you will be craig coping with the class from what ive heard
The problem is that I wonâ€™t be able to take all of the math electives that I want to in time
doesnt he have a winery or smth
not math electives for me but same
Graduating on time isnt important, taking the math electives is
I mean as long as youre paying i dont think theyll turn you away since yk money
I think there's a theoretical maximum cause you eventually run out of courses for credit
I think my friend said it best when he said that being taught by Craig Copi is like being taught by a dragon. It is very cool, and you will learn a lot of relevant information for physics and beyond, as well as a bunch of whimsical other facts. You also run a high risk of being burnt.

I really liked the class, it gave me a lot of insight into different algorithms which were cool even outside the context of physics. However it's very much a class where you have to put in work to listen and decipher the concepts, and even then you will be faced with a fair bit of bullshit questions and a lack of sympathy from your prof.

Tl;Dr, I recommend it, but only if you have the energy and aren't too neurotic about grades
Yeah. I wonâ€™t have the full real analysis sequence completed though and it would be my first 400 level math class. Itâ€™s really gonna depend on how I feel about real 1
I actually didnâ€™t experience much lack of sympathy, but how was it for you
Tbf I had him for 124 not 250 but still
I had multiple conversations with him that basically went
"Professor I'm confused, I did this thing and it's not working"
"[Mischievous grin] Well I don't know... why *isn't* it working?"
*5 seconds of silence*
"I... don't know"
But yeah if you're genuinely lost after that he does start to help you but he is really committed to the 'students need to solve the problems by understanding the material fundamentally' bit
Which is cool but also kinda frustrating if you just forgot a step and need him to say "you forgot a step"
got out of blossom in under an hour so double slayed
idk it kinda makes sense on some level
also if you read the freedom of expression policy its pretty open ended which is a good and bad thing I guess https://case.edu/provost/sites/default/files/2019-12/Policy%20on%20Freedom%20of%20Expression%20and%20Expressive%20Activities%20final.pdf

I am getting this now; I have enough funds from selling random crap at way above value on the market
damn
I just dont think Ive every seen that many people in one space EVER
Damn ur school must have been tiny
Yeah, my high school had around 2000 students but it wasn't that big really
TRUEEEEEEEE (dont put it here adam would see my face)
My class
My class didn't rank
My speech was ~1 minute and the length was mainly because my stage fright kicked in, i wanted the sub 1 hour graduation and i made sure it happened
Donâ€™t most public schools?
yeah luckily my class did not either
For a little while mine did, but I has pretty bad grades due to a summer school virtual pe class. I was like 90/290
The superintendent said something about dying in war 💀
The superintendent yapped for so long it was so boring
The speeches went on for an hour
Yep, and weâ€™re all worse off for it
The amount of students in my "district" really matters on how you cut districts up, as my town mostly didn't
That's why I said how you cut it for me. Many schools are their own district here for no reason
8 exams total (most of them independent of the class, which my school didnâ€™t have)
Imagine taking ap classes, ib > ap ||ib fucking sucks please PLEASE if you have younger siblings or know any younger kids tell them to STAY AWAY do ap or dual enrollment instead||
I think I saw someone at my school do 7 (mostly because my school sometimes crammed multiple ap classes into one)
My school believes in ib for all which is not a good thing at all because then the schools looks so bad with how few people get the ib diploma
I also tried to do dual enrollment classes during senior year but my local community college is ass
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania / Can't think of a rhyme for Pennsylvania
HACC, Harrisburg area community college
My school had almost every elective dual enrollment. There's no chance any school will accept it from our tech school ||especially not case||
my hs didnâ€™t even offer 20 APs
Okay. Here's how awful things have gotten in my area:
\> two people
\> both are almost valedictorian
\> one wasn't an athlete and so had to take PE
\> not an AP class, so brings GPA down
\> parents *sue the school district* over her not being valedictorian

I was already told that it was weird for me to be the owner of the server as a junior
imo itâ€™s weird to be the owner as someone who isnâ€™t a member of the class
my classâ€™s server was the last one to be owned by someone in the class
Some people tried to make one, but itâ€™s completely dead
Never heard of it
Talking to people??? Cmon thats lame how about i just kidnap a group mostly from this discord to play mario kart with
Ew I donâ€™t want to do that (actually I straight up might not do marching band just so I can go to the guardians game and be able to socialize more)

all freshmen dorms are shit
Thank you for the assistance, unfortunately not in the dorms.
Oh same 🔥
Yeah, it's an unfurnished apartment so I need something to sleep on.
And a queen would make me feel like a king so 😎
We theoretically got physical books but like they never came 😭
So bring a backpack to stuff shit in for discover week?
Sick 😎
A little over a week left
They are flexible and will work with you if you have an idea
Isn't that crazy
How does freshman forgiveness work?
last day to drop is last day of classes
Me when i see the average price of a laptop I got for like $300
Holy shit
It's weird though
The rest all range from being the same laptop but more expensive, or more expensive with worse specs
probably formerly a work laptop
and being sold on ebay when the fleet is being replaced
they use zbooks at my work and a decent amount of other places i know of
I kind of want to use work study money to buy a new computer
This laptop is likely staying until I graduate atleast
Not like it needs to be super powerful
fair, I'm doing similar. Idk how much you know about desktops, but you can probably modular your way into something better without spending $1500
I mean theoretically I could but I like the idea of full computer warranties and the like
that's fair
I already have a general idea of what I want to go for

The PC itself will probably change though cause I'd be buying this next year at the earliest and prices change a lot within a year
I've basically cobbled my computer together from 2nd hand parts for as cheap as possible but yeah I get that
that's not bad honestly
I'm due for a platform upgrade, but will probably keep GPU and storage and just change mobo cpu and ram
Cause cyber power likes to cheap out
It's not low end by any means but
I have a laptop and I just got a monitor
Gotta respect the fuck it we ball attitude
Like I'm sorry this looks like somebody's basement
i mean its not pretty but I never minded
Not too surprising but I dunno I'm kind of subconsciously comparing it to Clemson
Douthit was where I stayed and apparently was built in 2018 so it makes sense
Except for Raymond which has no pool table
This is where I stayed except where that rainbow wall is
This video was posted like a week before I even got there so I assume it just wasn't there yet
I think juniper has tiny little study rooms on the floors tho
The lounge seems kinda group study style on the 4th floor but that may be something else
the freshman dorms don't have practice rooms
clarke didn't
so if someone is practicing something in C and I need to practice something in D its an L for me
That still seems like something you do AFTER move-in💀😭
arent there like 80 students majoring in music or smth 😭😭
My bad
I like how there was 0 indication of gender in the email and Iâ€™m just brain dead
She wanted to know any preferred names or whatever cus she's putting them on the doors and also invited to a groupme
If it's the whole floor that means I got the gih RA
I just looked at the recipient list and it seems to be all guys, so I guess my floor is all male
went to 2 summer send offs where he was (one in person because Im in OH but not from here) + saw him the other day moving my roommate and a friend in early
I mean yeah I just didn't know if they were solely over us or not
Cause idk how far gih extends
donâ€™t do that
donâ€™t make them write a report
but what if i want to Commit the Atrocities :(((
Yeah I kinda want to be a menace to society
4th floor RA chill af too let us do shit all the time
your dog?
I'm forever Oscar the human in my fraternity bc Oscar the dog came first
I think it changes from year to year, but I could be wrong
afair all the dorms I went to were coed
Interesting, I thought I heard about another coed racetrack before but I could be wrong
Yeah Taft wasn't coed
i could also be wrong
I don't know how consistent they keep the labelling from year to year
I think it's usually just based on the makeup of the incoming class and how many men and women (and others) they need housing for
Advice: talk to people on other floors. Just because you are [gender] does not mean you canâ€™t interact with people of [other genders]
Uhm acktuallie I have never talked to a girl irl 🤓 â˜🏼
scary
I know so many people that didnâ€™t know anyone from their dorm except the people on their floor
holy shit no wya
i never interacted with the boys when i lived in taplin
taplin is just a girl dorm im sorry i donâ€™t make the rules. if youâ€™re a boy and you live there no you donâ€™t
I don't think I've ever seen a girl in Taft when I was living there
Ye ik. Hope that didnâ€™t come across as targeted
nah nah it did not, just wasnt 100% sure
i didnt even know 3/4 of the girls on my floor i never saw them 😭
tbh tho my friends who were in quad had more of a sense of community
I've never thought about that
me neither til I applied to one and got in on accident
and last yr
dawg it was so bad that as soon as I got into my room, no bedsheets no blankets no pillows, no fan, just rawdogged the mattress and used some pants as pillow and passed tf out
Idk if Iâ€™d be able to sleep in the summer without a fan in cle
Like thank fucking God Greek life was there to take my three huge ass luggages and a heavy ass backpack for me to my room so I can do the Covid test and go to Wade to pick up my ID only to find out that they didnâ€™t print my ID and had to go get a temporary one and get into my room
Oh god moving in during Covid sounds awful
Canâ€™t believe we canâ€™t choose this year 😤
Can we go cry and beg together 🥺
Idk
Itâ€™s close enough that we have a forecast
Also that we can't do both shifts smh
idk what iâ€™m doing at move in just that i will be There
I swear to god if itâ€™s raining while Iâ€™m moving in
My move in was pouring rain lmao
You can sweat while it's raining
Oh please it was drizzling
Mr. Nevada doesnâ€™t know rain
Iâ€™m just tired of going to Cleveland and it being raining, the last time I was there it poured the whole weekend
MATH MAJOR 1 BRAINCELL
Unfortunately you are becoming a cwru student
You will be spending a lot of time in Cleveland while it's raining
it was raining actually so bad
Sad
what if I dont believe in raincoats or umbrellas
Anyway I think they're assigning move in shifts to avoid a repeat of last year
what do you think (I forget them and pretend I can see shit far away half the time)
If you wear glasses, have an umbrella. If not, it doesnâ€™t matter. I love rain I just like to be able to see
My pro tip for glasses wearers is to have a dry cotton shirt underneath your rain coat to dry your glasses when they inevitably get wet
nah mine was bad timing, replying to adam so technically mean but not targeted
Adam isnâ€™t a glasses nerd. If he had glasses he would collapse to a nerd singularity. The eyesight holds the line
iâ€™ve worn glasses but only since i was almost 14
I can't think of a single one
for reference my sister got glasses in pre school
Rip
Math, discord mod, computer science, cwru student, knows much about nerds, other things I donâ€™t know about you probably
yeah i feel like the only people who ever do polls are the elderly
Math, cs, pure math, desire for a PhD, desire to be a professor, languages, linguistics, music, perfect pitch
Perfect pitch is something I have literally 0 control over and doesn't even make me a nerd
I have a feeling axel is about to list out my nerdy attributes
I'm not sure if I'm more of a nerd or more of a geek. Jury is still out on that
My desire to mosh pushes away from the nerd label, but my thoughts on metal subgenres puts me back in nerd territory
yes but you took 3 college classes in hs while doing the IB, likes piano, like nerd music, like nintendo, will be a discord mod again in the near future, apple nerd, like cats, have spent hours in minecraft mining obsidian and other tasks, were valedictorian, speed ran graduation, warrior cats fan ect.
near is relative
||FUCK||
I leave that part of life behind me
Well apparently his address is three spaces too
Tbh its just that i dont remember what it was cuz ive been disconnected from warriors for 3 years now
Its longer on not mobile
Well, being on the superior platform, I didnâ€™t see it like that
Do you have any recording of piano stuff in voice memos on your phone
That is so fair
@mounjee don't you know will wood
yeah alex you dont know will wood at all right
I swear to god if the new normal doesnt show up on apple music overnight im gonna throw a fit i cant deal with the YouTube ads anymore
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Mp3k8o2ObvC06GwGg3i7v?si=cAV-l9v6SQi0bfcbRLkp8A&pi=u-LdCTbXYYQMeD gonna drop my playlist i listen to in the car
It is but, controversial opinion here, spotify sucks
I cannot listen to bo burnham tho for some reason anymore
I just instantly feel like Im in lockdown (its my own fault, I listened to inside 24/7 then)
Thatâ€™s fair. I listened to him so much in middle school before inside came out and before lockdown so I donâ€™t have that connotation
I think look whos inside again to hot to go goes full circle
Nothing will ever make cents for me (I study theoretical nonsense)
and I should clarify to everyone: if you hate my music taste, that is also okay. Sometimes I hate my music taste
pretty solid choices, though I'm surprised it's only  6 hours
I forgot about 100 gecs
I have zero playlists because idk my brain has never liked them
Not your music taste I just hate you â¤ï¸
thats sad u dont have specialized playlists for moods or things u like?
sad sad existence
I mean i had one for when i was sad but it was really just one guy and then said artist decided he likes biting people so bye bye
Axel might remember me mentioning it so he doesnâ€™t count
oh him. fuck him
Is it Won't Stone
no axel has a goldfish memory (sorry glub glub 🐟 )
that guy sucks
songs that match bpm of car signal goes crazy (drop playlist pls?)
And then just assorted boring playlists
oh damn ur right about the songs, at least theres queen on there
every playlist needs at least 1 queen song
I sat in my car and timed it with a phone metronome and then just googled songs with nice multiples of that bpm
thats fair
And Iâ€™m trying to get more into king gizzard but havenâ€™t brought myself to sit down and listen to full albums recently
and it has followed me since 2018
if you want
i was trying to set the vibe for a game of OATH, but we ended up going with one someone else made
so i have it just in case i need it i guess
cuz forest boardgame isn't just a situation it's also a vibe
they're still in process
Why canâ€™t they just give us the tickets
they don't have the tickets they just have the connections
Or even just having two songs line up perfectly, like you would never know they basically just continue into each other
I don't really enjoy making playlists though, except for specific challenges
Yeah those make no sense to me, like if you want to theme a playlist its by genre or mood, no weird prompts
I need to go back and listen to their older albums again, its been a while
Was obsessed with them in middle school
Yeah I mean that's fair, I just prefer to categorize albums for that purpose
But I'm low-key just not in my fall out boy era anymore
Hard disagree
No ranking for smfs because I haven't listened to enough of it
Abap and tttyg are close for me
if anyone has a favorite fob album that isnâ€™t folie a deux i donâ€™t trust their opinion
It makes me sad that it was so hated when it came out
i want lullabye tho
Also my heart is the worst kind of weapon, ginasfs, and snitches and talkers get stitches and walkers
hidden tracks are incredible we need to bring them back
the first time i heard the one on nevermind i got SO SCARED
and so i left it in my cd player
i barely even knew the people on my floor 💀 seemed like they were all fast friends by day 2 and i was closed out after that. no idea what i missed
and it was so scary
Idk if I know every single fob song from memory still but I could get pretty close
Alpha dog and bob Dylan
i forgot about lake effect kid
same since tttyg
i donâ€™t like evening out with your girlfriend iirc
andy wasnâ€™t on evening out with your girlfriend
They don't count evening as their debut and neither do I
Calm before the storm still slaps tho, though it's also on grave
i donâ€™t fuck with pax am days i personally donâ€™t count it
I don't either
I've never really listened to them tbh
i just donâ€™t feel like listening through pax to find them
Sometimes covers go crazy hard
Idk that band
The bad wolves cover of zombie is also really good
placebo is gay and crazy thatâ€™s all you need to know
They're not that obscure tho
They never really took off
iâ€™ve never seen the same artist in concert (except for one time when an artist i saw headlining was an opener)
never the same one twice
And a band my friend had in high school (called glee club funnily enough) but idk if that really counts
Who are swmrs and what's wrong with them
their drummer dated a 17 year old at 23 âœ¨âœ¨ heâ€™s not in the band anymore but the whole band knew about it
isnâ€™t that peachy!
i havenâ€™t been to many tbh
Erra was supposed to be at one of those shows but their tour bus broke down and I was very sad
i was supposed to see cupcakke but it got rescheduled
i donâ€™t remember many openers tbh :(
i went to lucy dacus to see samia tho. hadnâ€™t really listened to lucy before that
but GA makes me hate myself
I usually prefer standing room as long as there's a spot to sit down at least sometimes
My brother hates them lol
omg i forgot about the ranger's apprentice
Being able to eat
I tell myself i wont do this, but i probably will
Damn okay maybe not
It is not that far from freshman dorms tho?
Wrong subway. The meal swipe one is in Tomlinson
so there is a perfectly good subway right there but you cant use a meal swipe
Itâ€™s on the quad tho
Fair not for everyone
I don't remember having to do this either this is new or I skipped it back then
Interesting, I didn't know. I don't remember seeing that on the schedule before either, but I'm not international so I'd be unlikely to recall either
i had an orientee who was in a similar situation to you, he was international and had gone to school in florida for years and he went to the session and found it wasnâ€™t very helpful bc he knew the info already
oh??
You see you could have gotten away with it too
Dropped lore and then ripped it away from us
never say never, you could always find someone ~~to marry for citizenship~~
i don't think i've met oscar
Just like Adam is still a red stormy sky for me
If someone told me in person he was oscar, Id be like "nah you aren't machamp so therefore you aren't oscar"
Im so sorry you had to find out this way
weeping, sobbing, and crying
No idk why you are dual case of you are both umbreon and your face reveal
Lol fair enough
still canâ€™t believe how i met charlie tbh
this is my discord account for everything, including a number of online communities where my I don't want my name/face public
real, a man could only wish to be him
i haven't been to hillel enough :(((
Never too late to pull up
i went to chabad for that reason :P
i never went until sophomore year tbh
I always feel like they secretly dislike me at chabad 💀
but yeah i feel like that too sometimes
i get that. I'm not very religious at all and it is a little scary sometimes
itâ€™s cause me and charlie are patrilineal
Also most Jewish people will disagree about various interpretations of different texts but that doesn't end up being a clean philosophical split
I'm about as reform as you get and not super observant, which for me pretty much means I'm a Jew in name/culture, but don't do as much of the religion stuff
That's totally fair and valid Jake
iâ€™m just kind of trying to find my place
iâ€™ve gotten more religious in college tho
but still not super religious
I didn't grow up celebrating a lot of holidays
My dad was a non-practicing Jew but my extended family gets varyingly more serious
i didnâ€™t really get a choice but now iâ€™m an adult
Man I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d spark a whole discussion about Judaism
I can't stop yapping 🥺 it's my culture
Id be so scared to fuck up a sneaker but its gas
Trying to avoid getting sucked into a lengthy conversation with the rabbi at jolly karaoke like-
donâ€™t get me started on grad school apps
Grad school apps will make you grad school yap
I guess Iâ€™m none to talk I still see you in my head as smiling child
What am i to all of you? Just a car
There is a YouTuber I watched one video of when I was 15 who taught basic Java and just so happened to be named Alex
Sort of, itâ€™s a weird mix of that guy and car and Dr. Pepper and glasses
just realized
I am now no longer a teenager
Needs
yk what if people on the internet see me as stellan gios i consider that a victory
fair point
I just need to find it
I would be mildly impressed if any 28ers can find my insta
but coworker did somehow find regardless
would need that 1000+ people symbol
yalls have to introduce yourselves that way tho
you and i still need to meet
None of you have card access to where I live though so I can just camp out forever
you can't stay there forever
Theres a chance i know someone who does
no i donâ€™t want to get fired
fair enough
I will be moving boxes up flights of stairs in carts and with elevators
now i need to laminate
idk if everyone does bc idk how many residents i have or who they are
i made 50 tho
if i have more than 50 ill cry
did you hand cut them??
They're hosting a Mario kart tournament apparently
I haven't played that game
I only ever used it for chem when studying for exams and couldnâ€™t find something I needed in my notes or math during the hw
and I got all the PDFs for free I didnâ€™t pay for shit
I had this website from tiktok that had like every textbook but i deadass forgot it 🗿
Oh
oh my
Why is Cleveland getting attacked right as weâ€™re supposed to there
Be happy it happened now since it shouldnt happen again this year
Oh mint
Tornadoes are scary lowk
Tornados always get broken up by the mountains before they reach me
they are scary highkey i think
i do not want a tornado please
last year there was a huge storm like. middle of orientation week
it was chill tho tbh. just rainy/windy and it was pretty short
I kinda like storms- nothing destructive, but I like the sound of the rain and thunder
tornado warning though. i laid there contemplating whether it was urgent enough that i should get out of bed and go downstairs (was on the fourth floor) and before good sense prevailed the tornado warning ended
i was already snug as a bug in a rug in bed and refused to get out unless it got worse
â€œNothing bad will ever happen to me, Iâ€™m the main character!â€
surely it would not be a real tornado. not right here while im trying to sleep. tornados only happen to other people and in the wizard of oz.
its that baltimore never really being subject to major weather events hubris. we get minor runoff from earthquakes maybe every couple of years and hurricane debby flooded the harbor for the first time since 2011 but like otherwise theres not much in the way of Scary Weather
i havent learned to respect it as i ought to
the tornado during o week 🥹 not only did i get soaked, but i also melted my hair dryer trying to blow dry my shoes (psa: don't do that)
it hit near the aldi
oh jeez
Fucking clarke out of all the places
Why sad
Nah clarke is awful
Dude I WANT to be morning
Damn 50/50 shot and I missed 😔
idk what that astrology is but Iâ€™m trusting that Jake is right
i'm a little hard of hearing
i do not need to make more bird
Why is it that the math majors yap so much here but the math club server is dead af
for me its impostor syndrome and i don't know people
chat i need your help
Brown because it sucks
Math is blue
This is important tho
Brown is nothing
Math
Math is blue ?????!
brown isnt used
math is whatever color i find when i reach into my bag on day 1 of class with 5 empty notebooks and start writing. Or whatever color my graph paper notebook is
this but only bc my calc binder this past year just so happened to be black
this is true of all classes, with the caveat that math classes tend to utilize larger and nicer spiral bound notebooks
Iâ€™m going green tho
I havenâ€™t taken history since 10th grade
Only disputing red for history cuz red is clearly english
physics was red last year for me
Red canâ€™t be history cuz red is english
Adam = red = math
Red = devil = hate math = Adam???
Things are always bad
Yknow what yeah I can accept red as math from this logic
why cant two subjects be the same color
okay why is adam the patron saint of math now
math and physics are blue
Fr (my dad teaches history boo parents)
Organization reasons it feels messy
fair enough
Mostly cuz organizing
Donâ€™t shit on history
Oh then yeah physics and math are both blue then
Oh okay fine I respect it, I only shit on math majors
this sem i'm taking 2 math and 2 english classes so my notebooks will be whatever i can get my hands on
What would you do if I said my old hs had a whole room per dorm dedicated to free notebooks and stuff people left behind
this opinion has caught me much flak
iâ€™m waiting on a print request and i need to make like One more thing with the cricut
i hate the only math 122 being at 825am
Early morning classes are evil
same. just need to print out a few things and then stick things up. maybe got an hour of work left. do have to do the welcome bulletin board but that'll take me two or three hours max
oh i forgot that maybe i should make a meet the RA flyer
why do they wanna know who i am tho
it doesnâ€™t help that all of the second floor except my 7 residents is under one RA
): but car...
:0000 CAR?!?!?!?!?
my favorite piece of hannah lore to drop is that my sorority died
idk what iâ€™m doing during move in!
I wish I could help with move in but alas my cousin is getting married the dat before
That sucks sorry
Oh or good idk
i'll need to get some stuff in the morning probably but i should ideally be available most of the day on the 18th if people wanna hang out...i just gotta work my Manual Labor Shift in the afternoon. And then the 19th i personally move in but they won't tell me what time they're delivering my stuff :((((((
in some ways itâ€™s easier to just rip the bandaid off and do it in one
i drive up from colorado at the end of this week, i should arrive on the 19th
o damn you're driving?
So I need to look out for THIS face on campus
do u want me to bring anything u can't take through TSA?
naw I should have everything cause im checking a couple of bags so i can toss my knife in there
ty tho
my favorite thing is Never leaving
If u never Leave then u never have to move in again
Kinda true tho
I've never been more normal in any space other than Case
If you're hoping to talk to us, might want to do a bit before 12 so we're not expected to be actively working
Idk if I'd say that Matthew
||Charlie this is a joke the math major braincell consumed both of us like 1 year ago||
whats up with the air quality in cleveland rn
was curious what the temperature is there but the weather app is much more interested in the aqi of 136
the air quality
idk why downtown is so high
prob cause downtown
People when bad air quality in California: wow, CA sucks, canâ€™t believe itâ€™s always burning there
People when bad air quality in Ohio 💀: wow, I canâ€™t believe Canada is foisting their smoke into us
this reminds me everyone needs to beware the First Semester Shitsâ„¢ï¸
god yeah whatever stomach issues i have have been flaring all summer already and readjusting to college food,,,,, i dread.
Spelling is a stupid construct
Whatâ€™s wrong with LÃ¼dnrer?
don't listen to him
What class is this
haha rip
Oh yeah, I have homework for two nursing classes
damn yall have homework assigned and everything meanwhile none of my canvas pages are up 😭
well glee club is but that doesnt count
Apparently abstract got put up before last school year was over
pain
$90 and homework on the first day is rough
With how often I would switch out of classes that costed money in highschool
Iâ€™ve already had meetings with my professors about how weâ€™re gonna fuck with the students this year 😈🙏🏼
Where would I hypothetically be able to pirate the math 125 textbook if hypothetically libgen is down
Sorry man I only took 125💀
🌚 honestly kinda hoping they reject me cause I've never sewn in my life
i feel bad applying for other on campus jobs when the one i have is great but id love something more fitting for my resume </3
they dont even ask for experience
they dont even give the option for a resume
omg??
my planned out schedule looks p awful but i really want to do both
Depending on how much AP credit / how willing you are to overload, Math / MechE can be kind of oof
However, I do know a Math / AE double major who is a rising senior
For most majors it's not that bad but meche and math don't have a ton of overlap, it could get pretty challenging
i have ab/bc, physics c, history and english, cogo/gopo, and psych?
phys ed is unavoidable unfortunately
which u should have required since u r mech e
i was able to get away w doing none since 6th gradeee
i think im like fine doing actual phys ed if its required, im just scared of schedule conflicts with the major req classes?
There are so many pe classes that you'll be able to find some that work with your schedule
oh I forgot to mention some of the phys ed classes arent actually fitness classes. Notably, there are cooking classes
but you cant competlely avoid fitness since you need atleast a semester's worth of fitness classes i think
i like working out a lot, i just like doing it on my own time ;-; it is what it is though
Are you looking at the math bs or ba?
If you want to do meche, I would strongly consider doing the ba instead
i dont really understand the difference but laying out the schedule, bs seemed easier to do
The strict math major requirements which are in excess of MechE are: 307, 308, 321, 322, 324, 330
What do you want to do after undergrad
im on the fence in between trying to go into quant analysis/ib or just a normal mech e job
BS requires twice as many math electives as BA
oh!
idk how i missed that?
~~Me already being done with math electives after this semester without even trying to be~~
do most doubles with math do a ba?
I am doing a BS in math
The computer requirement for the ba may also permit engr 130 which you have to take for meche, but the BS requirement only takes math 330 as meeting that requirement
I'm doing a BS in math, but my other degree is a BA
It's very straightforward for a CS major to take on a secondary BA in math
The CS BS requires 20 "CS classes", and 6 of mine are math
The main math courses that can't count towards a CS degree are the three semesters of analysis
MATH 228, 304, 308, 330, 380, 408, and 494
You can manage your degree plan for cs and math in such a way that you can count about 10 classes towards both degrees or something like that
Notably though, only 3 of these 7 are actually requirements for the math degree, the rest are just for fun
Oh well physics isn't required for the math ba
And math bs
For example, math BA vs BS has the latter requiring 3 semesters of physics, 2 semesters of another science, a specifically rigorous computing course, and 3 additional tech electives
Moral of the story: trying to get a math bs along with your meche degree is probably not going to be worth it
Unless you can convince your advisor to count some meche courses as math electives, and then you'd be BING chilling
i know a lot of math courses count as mech electives
thatd be such a hack if i could get mech courses as math electives too lol
yeah thats fair
You may be able to get a few of them, but there's an upper limit on how many non department courses can count towards math electives
I'm a true expert on math degrees because I've changed between three of them 😭
The only math degrees I've never had down for myself are stats and math + physics
I've been declared as an applied math bs, a math ba, and a math bs in that order
but if i end up going down a finance track i feel like itd end up being pretty useless
@mounjee is combining physics with an engineering degree, and from my understanding that's challenging enough to make it work
math/physics with engineering would probably be too hard?
Physics + math already kind of behaves like a double major, the only things you could really add to it viably are similar enough tracks like maybe astronomy, statistics, or possibly cs
yeah thats fair
I actually started out as a meche major before I pivoted into applied math
Why? Youâ€™re still doing math
my first semester is looking super super easy right now, it feels pretty wrong
I realized that it made me very sad to think that I would never have to take another math class after freshman year. I also had some personal issues with engineering and I realized it didn't fit what I wanted with my life
for the linear class?
I wanted my college experience to be more full of exploring topics I find interesting, not just grinding out meche classes
I also am not interested in defense contracting work and related positions
thats so fair lol
Big rip
Linear algebra in your first semester might be too hardcore tho. But it'll certainly help you decide if you want to be a math major lol
There's no harm in taking linear algebra in your second or third (or even fourth semester)
lol I forgot there are two Meckes
Unfortunately the other meckes passed away :(
If you want to pure math though, I would recommend linear second semester and abstract third
Oh man I didnâ€™t know that
oh actually? i was thinking just multi wouldn't be too tough since ive gone through half the curriculum in a class at school already, and linear might be kinda fun?
Linear is definitely fun but it is sort of the first "real" math class (in the sense of being about proofs and formalisms instead of calculations)
Multi isn't that bad tbh, but adjusting to proofs can be pretty intense if you aren't familiar with them
a fully bad idea to take it first sem?
oh 😭
There's so much to adjust to for college, the average 300 level math class in your first semester will bring you pain
i wanted to kind of get ahead as much as i could? but i dont wanna overload and regret it
Charlie will kill me for saying this, but ...
... if any time is the time to try overloading, it is 2nd semester freshman year. You can freshman forgiveness a class if it's going terribly, so I would recommend (if MechE + Math is your calling), doing 4/5 your first semester and trying 6 while you can still take advantage of freshman forgiveness
itd still only be 6 classes total? with one being a 1 credit hour class
Tbf there aren't huge consequences for dropping classes after freshman year either
The W on your transcript means very little as long as there aren't many of them
I think I was technically signed up for 10 classes last semester?
but i didnt want this sem to be like a throwaway?
Then take 5 if you feel that way
bc currently, im taking 13/14 credits
Add another class if you feel the intoxicating pull
thats fair thats fair
Or if you can't, see if you can find an interesting English class to get your English credits taken care of
If enough people want in
Physics is one of those classes at Case that a lot of non-majors have to take and wish they didn't have to take
Because he doesn't need anything after it for his degree
I'm also actively putting off gen chem lab and intro bio because they're low priority for me despite the fact that I need them to graduate
Because if I have to deal with bader I will be sad
I know a lot of ppl who took it as their first physics class and did well though
Iâ€™m getting in without an invitation, they have to open more lab slots- anyways, it is possible
Should calculus 1 already have been taken before physics 1 or taken together?
Calc 1 and physics 1 are technically coreqs iirc, you'll be okay. Idk about 123 though
Ya donâ€™t take 123 if you havenâ€™t taken calc imo
I didnâ€™t take 121 so idk
Itâ€™s just a. Lot of ppl suck at physics lol
If you donâ€™t get it conceptually itâ€™s hard to do well
So its nothing to do with workload, teacher, speed of the class, etc.
Idk about 121
I think everyone ended up with an A bc martens like left the class randomly during the semester due to family health problems
Oh and the required lab
Is so annoying
Lots of work and your grade is entirely dependent on the TA u get
U do integrals in 123 which you donâ€™t learn until the very end of calc 1 so I wouldnâ€™t advise it
fair enough, im sure using calculus made easy by thompson isnt a good refresher for it?
Uh idk tbh
The math is the easiest part of physics imo
I wouldn't really describe it as dreadful. The labs kind of suck, but really it's just challenging in terms of material and one of the first classes a lot of people take in college, which makes it harder. Physics 121 also runs on the idea that the average person should be scoring in the 70s for an exam and then just scales grades at the end
The scaling is pretty generous, but a lot of case students who are used to scoring high on every exam find it uncomfortable when that's no longer the case
I wouldn't worry too much about the math of physics 1 tbh, but if you don't know what derivatives and integrals are it'll be even more challenging conceptually
Its really rusty but im sure i'll be able to pick it back up again.
Physics 2 is less intuitive conceptually for a lot of people because it involves things you can't see
It also requires some more comfort with different regions of math, like integrals and imaginary numbers
Starting college can be nerve wracking and scary, I want y'all to feel confident and comfortable when you get to case
Haha I am 20 for the time being. I really don't need any form of monetary repayment
Idk why maybe my sat? Maybe my math AP scores?
But I never took an AP physics
probably SAT
bc my math SAT was nearly perfect and i also got an invite for math 124 despite getting a 3 on AB
Yeah I didn't want to take phys 123 because regular physics seemed like it would be hard enough lol
My math sat was good
Haven't thought about it in a long time tbh
Pro tip for incoming freshmen: don't talk about AP scores and standardized tests unprompted, it's cringe
for a sec i thought this was shaming me then realized it was very much promoted
omg
omg omg
i wish you lived northside :(
Sometimes I wish I didn't have to climb the elephant stairs every day 😭
Part of me wants to make a bad financial decision
But I won't yet
Bad financial decisions are the best kind of decisions
I want to make a bad financial decision too but i wont because i need to be smart
The benefit of the end of sigma psi
Part of me wants to wheel my pc to every class, the other part is clinically insane
Idk any other chapters that do that the same way
@mangnani6 college worried face?
not worried face
idk how to react abt college tho
Fair
we lost last round
idk how bout u come play :3
round ended
you didnt even do anything
aint no way pink gets away with that
I'll visit, don't worry OX will never be able to get rid of me hanging around (though I try not to come to too many of y'all's rush events, feels too much like a conflict of interest)
I forgot that was even there
was I correct that that's your partner tho?
I too want to make poor financial decisions but I will not due to a commitment to responsibility
Tyler stop being nosy about people you haven't even met 😭😭
You'll never find where I buried em so don't even try
that's fair.
i just love being poor
do you want me to ping you when it gets posted
i NEED a cloak
I have a friend who I think is working at the London opera during a gap year as a costume apprentice
They were stoked so does not sound like a bad gig
She is the supposed chem 105 prof
Nvm I might be wrong
Idk tho!
whats a bad rmp rating
is like a 2 bad
Where do you find the form
Don't believe everything you read on rmp
I don't think you technically *have to* but getting to all of the orientation stuff will be much easier if you do
There's also no proof that people writing reviews have ever taken the class
I have yet to see a review that raised my eyebrows
My school has a gear up program
It's to help underrepresented and basically poor students get help and mentorship for college
Well besides some college tours where we went to Atlanta and basically all across the southern US
Well usually you get helpful info regarding course structure that you wonâ€™t find anywhere else
Like are the exams easy? Are questions taken directly from HW, lecture slides? Etc
Mostly stem students who don't know how to write a paper
i ended up in the parallel phil 101 class with a better rating (she has a 3.3 now but i swear it was at least 4 last fall) and it was terrible
classic midwest weather
dont expect anything
the humidity is the worst
yep it's the worst when you feel sticky and hot
oh woah 😭😭
ive never experienced snowfall ever
what day/time are you moving in
time to freeze to death
oh
i came by in april and died
I think I'm moving in tomorrow because I'm from out of the US?
idk if they have stuff for men actually
I got a large jacket though
oh no ur gonna die
That gear will last until about Nov 1
i live 45 minutes away and it gets really bad
gets fucking cold in the winter
i mean depending on how good you are with cold a hoodie can last you till maybe late november or until snow starts staying for longer than a week
is it like a rain coat
But when it gets to way below freezing, you don't want anything but a proper coat
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  I spent last winter only having used my big coat like twice so
not too late yet
dunno why it took me so long
TT not the modules i havent even started
i just sat my ass down for like an hour
did homescapes for 15 but that doesnt count
i guess ik what im doing on the drive to cleaveland
first aid is ez tho
i forgot abt those
Wtf is a pulseless ventricular tachycardia 🗣ï¸🗣ï¸
heart go fast
I have a bad feeling about that class
Idk is it poisonous?
bro im prob gonna show up late to every single one
i took haps in hs last yr so i have like a scaffold
I think u might die
Oh no! What about my mug?
i took human body systems last year and we did a couple
then theres not enough blood going out
I feel so behind listening to this convo
cuz not enough blood --> not enough oxygen to cells --> shock?
no same i only know what tachycardia is (heart go fast)
cuz deficient oxygen would cause shock
heart problems being one of them
well ur gonna die fast
How are you still alive?
cuz it closes up ur throat
Oh naur
I still remember the day in freshman year when Adam told me the funny story of how one time his heart stopped
it cant control what it puts out so then
who needs a sleep schedule when you can just overdose on caffeine
caffine cant save me (does not work on me ive tried) but i can have fun with it
if u dont get it treated quickly (w an epi probably) u die
either i cant sleep for hours or i pass out
same idk why but I get sleepy after drinking it
and i cant tell when either is gonna happen
oh that causes caffeine to not work?
im on the spectrum but never got tested for adhd
i forgot why but yea
didn't they have to discontinue those bc of lawsuits
yea a few ppl died
but most cases ive seen r throat closing im gonna die kind of reaction
ofc shes gonna have problems
you can die from Panera bread lemonade??
the people that died also had preexisting heart problems
Problem being that you don't always know if you have a pre-existing heart condition
oh damn
would it be od or heart problems related to that
if someone was determined enough they could od on potassiam by eating a shit ton of bananas
Depends how cold
ur stomach bursting
Most i bundled up last year was a windbreaker over my hoodie
that aint od
it cant be one of those thin hoodies its gotta be fur lined
hoodie + puffer coat + fleece pants on especially cold days
idk if yall know of that nintendo competition
Except Hayley who is from WiscÃ¦nsin
where some woman drank a shit ton of water
One of my high school teachers was from Cleveland and he told me he still had nightmares about getting work done at the CWRU dental school
cuz ph is important
if blood ph goes like. barely out of range itll kill you right?
idk if water plays into that
ikr we have every salad possible and fried cheese curds it doesnt get much better than this guys
no hes right tho
but its part of a list of problems
no but seriously if u play like a brass instrument or some kind of metal your slightly acidic skin eats away at the metal (source: my sister who plays saxaphone)
oh rly??
but u cant od on water
oh?
if you have proper winter clothes it never happens
ive been out in like 0 degrees or something and as long as you have good equipment nothing happens
there was one day last year i think where it was cold enough for frostbite?
oh yeah i remember school got canceled for me last year bc of the cold
My hands sweat a lot and i never used it with a case
FUCK YEAH ACID SWEAT
Are you never worried you're going to drop your phone and break it
ugh
omg
she dropped her phone once and it shattered...
i had a classmate who would always get the new apple phones and never used a case with them 😭
it'd take a while tho
ice/dragon regional variant would go hard
it gets cold enough to get frostbite?? 😭😭
that looks like thatd hurt
Alan how do you find the weather rn
hurts a shit ton if you warm up too fast
my bro got stage one skiing last winter
Same difference really
tall skill issue for him really
fair
during new student week i made the mistake of walking out of the bathroom without drying my hands
frostnip right away 😭
fr just dont get it
should have just respected the family genes and stopped growing early smh
thats not gonna last long
back at home you literally cannot wear long sleeves or pants like 9 out of the 12 months
i went from florida to cleveland
bay area never snows
Apparently some of the hills get snow occasionally
oh they do
It last snowed here in 2009
I miss the bipolar winters itâ€™s my favorite season
It is that same weather ALL year
I'm insanely jealous about that
you've never experienced winter rain omg
oh fuck
Are you even in OH right now
if its a bad enough year we get 4 winters
where its 3 months of snow for a week, defrosting and sludge, then more snow
If you slip on her you die
My experience with Ohio weather:
August: indoor heated swimming pool
September: hoodies
October: I wasn't aware rain could be this cold
November: cold rain does become snow yeah
December: beanie
January: scarf
February: this should not feel warm
March: heavy jackets away!
April: who knows
May: spring
nearly been taken out by unsalted sidewalks multiple times in this
case doesn't (or didn't for a while) salt the portion of the sidewalk from our door to the main sidewalk
walking across euclid in uptown i almost slipped and fell so many times
I ran on icy sidewalks as a freshman and two friends followed behind "WHY CAN YOU RUN ON ICE YOU DIDN'T GROW UP HERE!!!"
oh 🤣😭
how did you not slip and die 😭
ouch
to any upperclassmen whose taken 8ams
Also i should probably just say the bad news for the people who havent checked the weather, its probably gonna rain most of move in day
i had 8:25 MTWRF my whole freshman year
i mean this summer i've been waking up at 6:15 every morning for work
don't stay up to midnight too often
my sleeping schedule is yet to form
ive turned off 3 alarms in my sleep in a row before
forecast can tell you itll rain all day and then its just a 2 minute shower dont trust the forecast
Im gonna have a fun time fixing my sleep schedule, im still on my 1-8am schedule
i need to use the one where you have to solve a math problem to disable the alarm but my motor function is shit when i wake up
wish i was kidding
at the end of last fall semester i was waking up at 8pm
TT im so sorry to my roommate in advance for the fact that i have a lot of 8 ams and dont like waking up
how does that happen 😭
crunch time and probably narcolepsy or smth close to it
this is gonna be pain
i have 8 ams all week except for friday where i have a 10 am instead TT
fun fact: on android alarms would randomly not happen during my freshman year due to default android power saving settings suspending the clock app so it wouldn't process alarms sometimes
I don't 😎 hope this helps
You poor soul
lol ive heard that a lot of students end up skipping anatomy and only show up for exams
esp w my professor apparently shes a character
ive got a&p monday and wednesday at 8
it was something similar to this but i wasn't in battery saver
oh yayy
i tended to shower earlier than most girls on my floor, think there was only 1 time all year where all 4 were taken
what room in sherman are you in :0 if you dont mind sharing
my freshman year someone at another school died from an infection from feet contacting the floor of a dorm shower
oh ew
...i did not need to know that
oh eww
Also idk if ass is the worst thing that's been put on a couch it can't be worse than the toilet
yeah someone did that while it was in the common room like 2nd week of classes or smth
oh fuck
unfortunately some people do not like to dispose of hygiene products properly
crocs dont deserve to step on the horrors
oh what 😭
uh oh
didn't we have the whole discussion about "screaming one out"?
Sex etiquette in college: don't be in public. Let your roommate know/put a sock in the door. Don't ban your roommate from coming into your room past the time they're usually sleeping. Clean up after yourself. Don't get weird fluids everywhere, yes even in the shower, don't just let it "run down the drain"
praying the sherman common room furniture survives this year
This isnâ€™t that bad at all
I want to say either the football players or wrestlers usually live in Sherman. And in my year they smashed and destroyed a bunch of furniture
WHAT THE FUCK
the pool table got broken pretty early on
Didn't they also steal another buildings ping pong table and put it in their bathroom or something?
god damn the crwu lore goes crazy
It's okay to say what you really feel
can someone give me a lil tour
keep in mind that in case undergrad lore I am a boomer but apparently human fecal matter would show up in tylers common room quite frequently last year
nothing got broken in my dorm but we had the occaisional people not flushing after they pooped and also once or twice leaving used pads in the shower
dont have high standards for the bathrooms
I had that flight and it got cancelled and I had to transfer at Newark
Nvm then I donâ€™t know HEC
I think my dorm had a big kerfuffle over accusations that someone put shit in one of the washers 😭 people claimed that it was just wadded up paper towels but the smell leads me to believe the other interpretation . . .
OH
Larry didn't pay for sears, I asked him
middle left
layer of buildings that is close to the actual quad
campus isn't super confusing, it's just a long strip
i learned how to enter rockefeller from the back first because of construction and didn't recognize it from the front for while
The whole quad was under construction during our o week
RIP spitball tho you will be missed
aw boo do the blocks still go clunk clunk when you scooter over them
if you need an elevator in rockefeller you have to go in from the back
aw
oh what
i missed all the fun stuff :(
I ran into her in Veale
idk my roommate is one who did the training and signup
i didnt know who she was at the time i just remembered everyone freaking out on sidechat lol
some of the guys I know in frats tried to get them to attend case frat parties
Nord 2 still has the fat man surfing logo on the doors lmao
Rock stairs suck because they're steeper than other stairs
Well I haven't really been to many, but I can extrapolate that they are generally kind of ass
how bad is hazing
itâ€™s so tiny omg
i was never hazed
Doesn't happen in my chapter, can't speak to all of them tho
ppl went out of their way to make sure people didn't feel pressured to do anything for us and nobody was abused or anything like that
Aren't OX pledges not allowed to help in the kitchen 😭
shoutouts to having to force james off of dishes because he just wanted to do our dishes
so it is taken very seriously
yes but they won't stop trying
oh yeah freshies do the hazing modules or else you cant join clubs
Hazing and accusations of hazing are taken quite seriously at Case
they will find you and you will be in trouble
bad shit happened in 2020 and got the school investigated by the DOJ
I've reported hazing before and had a whole meeting about it with a case employee, they don't just push it under the rug
so they are wary of bad things happening with greek life again
I got this particular information from someone who used to work relatively high up at the university and recently quit
i literally had no friends for my last 3 years of high school and came to school hating social interactions and wanting to just stay in my room
somehow ended up in a fraternity
there is something for you and probably in a place you don't expect
I knew basically from day one that I'd be joining a design team. Didn't know it would be Baja though
because I donâ€™t think I can specific it anymore since Amazon isnâ€™t letting me 😭
Also we need to talk about screen time smh
I did it as:
11451 Juniper Rd
Cutter House #218
Cleveland, OH 44106

Using wades address makes sure the packages donâ€™t get left in front of the forms
if you have any other baja questions, feel free to ask away as I'm on our operations board and was previously an executive
omg??
nah, I'm just "important" (not really)
I used to be our hardware engineering lead and am now the test engineering lead
they build car
depends on the person, anywhere from 6 hours a week to 40-50
I put in 40 last year, do not recommend.
oh lord
omg me too wtf
Grab your stuff, go to the bathroom, shampoo + face wash + body wash, scrub and rinse, condition, rinse, dry off, leave
you can lightly water hair at sink if you really want to let it soak, but you can just dry-apply shampoo and scrub in when you get in
learned it at a field training i went to in missouri
it seems like they just converted pending aid to actual and haven't added some things in yet, mine also jumped and I realized it was bc they haven't added my national merit in yet
Iâ€™m in the Las Vegas airport and saw slot machines in the airport the second I stepped off the plane
I was surprised to find out that most grocery stores don't have a room with slot machines and video poker
Do I have to gamble to board my flight
If you have time for food the Ruby's diner in the Las Vegas airport is really good
I've only been there once 😭 but sometimes I still think about it
Naw, I have 1/3 of a burrito in my backpack and my flight leaves in an hour
Idk I always waive it
i wanted to but idk if i can
cause medicaid doesnt go to ohio
my mom said we're gonna have to try cus she cant afford it lmao
oh 😭
damn that sucks
Iâ€™m on the same flight
Is anyone gonna be on the Denver to Cleveland flight UA621
@bobbylikebob are you on the flight thatâ€™s leaving rn
Ainâ€™t no way
I need to know for sure, because some people are saying otherwise- Wyant isnâ€™t the â€œathlete gymâ€, right? Anybody can go there?
They have specific hours where certain sports teams get priority there (or sometimes reserved I think) but anyone can work out there
But during normal hours itâ€™s fair game?
Yeah idk if I want to walk all that way at 7 am
One ice cream, itâ€™s all gone
That would suck if true
doesnt seem to be exactly what youre looking for but
In my experience keeping a regular gym routine for the entire semester is challenging enough- let alone super early in the morning
I just feel like itâ€™ll be easier for me to go in the morning, and get in the routine of going right away
wyant will probably be almost empty at 7am so no waiting or asking to work in
Nothing wrong with morning gym people :) I'm just not one of them
All the gyms are gonna have sports teams practicing during normal hours
this summer i went an entire month consuming zero caffeine
And my junior year I went to Veale at 6 am and just lifted with the wrestling/swimming/crew people
Plus if you wanna go even earlier than they open just go around 6 and tailgate the athletes💀
Did that for a whole year nobody said shit
upb posting on instagram again 😭 i can no longer avoid the resumption of college- this is tragic
â€œI can no longer avoid the resumption of collegeâ€
i dont wanna go back it's too soon
haven't bothered checking canvas i'm too scared
i keep checking canvas bc i rlly want my english syllabus but nothing is up 😭
which english class?
I still have no canvases \:(
yeah ! though id take it even if it didnt count for uger lol im a sucker for academic scifi
what confuses me is how science fiction in literature counts for moral and ethical reasoning, but philosophy 101 doesnt
sure but i feel like some of the other classes are equally as much a stretch
They want completing your requirements to be as inconvenient and unintuitive as possible
fr? God I donâ€™t know how I am going to get that local and global communities uger like nothing fits it
they dont seem to cap double counting though--anth 102 counted for global perspectives, human diversity, and a social sci req for me
idk why the two are inconsistent
but i would expect even the longer list to grow; uger is only a year old atp
they're probably trying not to tell people, "you need to study abroad to have a chance at finishing your degree, pay us more money please"
This does seem like a really stupid requirement
it is - Iâ€™m hoping they will add more classes as time goes on tho
Worst comes to worst declare a classics minor, go on a study abroad for free, then drop the minor
I think that works donâ€™t quote me tho
i took engl 320 last sem and it doesnt currently count as communication intensive, but im gonna see if my advisor can get it to count anyway
yeah i mean my grade is the first grade to be under uger and id doubt if any of us are close enough to graduating for this to be an issue yet
school 100% beats having a job I'm trynna savor my last year as much as I can
and they have since last year
im gonna study abroad so im not too worried
but i spent a year worried about it before they added study abroad and old habits die hard lol
idk if Iâ€™m going to study abroad - I want to do it during the summer but itâ€™s pretty expensive
I guess they're trying to make people study abroad/co-op?
what about one of those spring break ones where you take a class during the semester and then just go on the trip for the break? that negates the standard study aborad experience ofc but its probably cheaper
Unethical life pro tips. I would not recommend this because it would take away funding from the classics department when you don't intend to remain a part of it
oh :/ that sucks
Yeah ik I was joking donâ€™t do it
If you study abroad for a semester you can cover it with financial aid, not the case for a spring break trip
yeah how does the financial aid for a semester work? do you just pay your case tuition without regard to what the host school costd?
That's a question for the office in charge of study abroad (or the office of financial aid)
looks like you pay your cwru tuition but the host schools room and board
i really wanna go abroad but yeah i have to make sense it wouldnt fuck me over
If you want some evidence for why it should
okay sick
Probably just gonna go abroad in summer bc of that tbh
I want to talk to my advisor and see if I can get my summer service (americorps) to count for global and local engage
take advantage of the career center and coop office
the big thing for getting hired out of college is having internships/coops and projects from what i have heard
The idea of doing both didn't rly register
you don't need both, co-op has some additional requirements but case also helps you get set up with them from my understanding
there's a fee you pay to stay registered with the school and thats it afaik
i was also told that all the aid that only lasts 8 semesters gets pushed back when you do a coop so you won't lose any of that for the last semester if you take 8 semesters + a coop semester
Had to dip though
Iâ€™m so thankful case isnâ€™t a â€œparty schoolâ€ ngl
How does it feel
Wdym mart kart is hard core
THE HUMIDITY SUCKS AND I WISH I COULD SUCK ALL THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE AIR
MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IT HASNâ€™T BEEN THIS MILD LEVEL OF HUMIDITY SINCE LOCKDOWN
Blud willingly went to Ohio 💀
Arenâ€™t you in Ohio?
I still cant look at adams pfp without seeing the watermark since he mentioned it before
Close enough
Holy shit there is a watermark
Wow imagine pulling your pfp off of the internet
I would never
Spiderman is pretty sick tho ngl
Did not steal a photo of a car
Goes hard
Anyone wanna see the stack of math books I brought with me
Adam wakes up, opens his door and Jake is just standing there waiting for the scrolls of math  knowledge
Ew itâ€™s all pure math, yuck
All of it except basic algebra I
The best math
Anyway yeah if anyone wants to borrow one for the semester just lmk
Scary
I call math methods for a bit, I just want to see what itâ€™s about
@jschlanket you want dibs on anything?
Idk if this is impolite, but maybe PDEs too? I donâ€™t want either for the whole semester
I need a lecturer to yell the ideas into my skull
Iâ€™m too used to self-teaching, itâ€™ll be weird actually being in math classes tbh
Ive never really understood the love of chalkboards when theres whiteboards instead
Oh seven
Lmao. Most terrifying math class name: "Introduction to Elementary Arithmetic"
HORRIBLE
Unrelated: last semester I became able to draw dotted lines on a chalkboard, and I highly recommend all of you do too
Isnâ€™t it made by some Korean company now?
Ah my mistake, most terrifying math class name: "Math 1"
I took that one last semester
I lowkey want to take it but idk how Iâ€™d justify it to myself
You get math electives for a reason
It's really not that much suffering
My complex prof was definitely stricter than any of my other math profs have been
Not really I donâ€™t think
If you aren't a person who likes geometry it might be totally miserable
Calculator goes hard
I was reading one and it physically hurt me
I probably donâ€™t even need to say why this is already setting off alarm bells for seasoned math people
Weird and fun-looking math
Its just simple logic really
I just felt a drop of rain
Never
Already dealing with enough pain from having to take 3 physics classes
Its raining a good bit by me
Thats what will probably happen to me too
I havenâ€™t had mitchellâ€™s in a while, will definitely be stopping sometime during o week
are they still serving campfire s'mores? or is that seasonal flavor gone now
campfire s'mores became my fav flavor this summer but i havent been back for a few weeks
And thus, Alex (Math â€˜28) was born
Why did i just lose my cs degree \:(
Itâ€™s kinda like â€œmoneyâ€, the concept just doesnâ€™t exist
Mr. math man
Packing hell
Im waking up at 3 am tmrw to start leaving for ohio
Could be worse
If I donâ€™t sleep I wonâ€™t miss that much of orientation
The path goes through Youngstown how *could* it be worse
I sadly do not get to join in on the fun of a long car ride
You can just go in circles around campus for 7 hours
And then it goes from there either into anatomy or ems stuff
My hs bio teacher gave me this sticker on our last day of class 🥲
thats so fair
i had cutler before disability resources gave me a single room in hitchcock :(
My door has googly eyes
I am trying to find who did it the year prior
No unfortunately
aye well if i find the time during discover week dont be surprised if you get a knock
Focus on moving first tho
You got this, lowkey Iâ€™m free that day so if someone needs help I can try my darndest
rip I forgot to get a photo
I feel bad tho I was so awkward when I first met them 🤣
Fair but also I think it was alright who wouldnâ€™t be
yeah fair 🤣
You gain energy from the joy of skipping though
fair
fr tho it just feels better than running for some reason for me lol
Ok Iâ€™m gonna go to bed so I can wake up early to catch my flight tomorrow. Adamâ€” I will be in your walls shortly
Flight tomorrow gang 🤝
Sorry I'm roleplaying as a nursing major
My bad
It's never too late
If adam wants to graduate on time it might be too late
And easier to get a job than cs (or math)
Grad school
You'll never have a hard time finding a job as a nurse
â€¦thatâ€™s not (crying in Biochem)
I'm just your average math and nursing major
oh right sorry 🤣
Sure a gazelle can sprint away fast, but humans can run for *hours* when fit
If it's a hot enough day, a human can walk after some prey animals for like eight hours until they collapse from exhaustion, and it was how we hunted before we had tools
Alright nerd Adam out, math major Adam back
Math major is still nerd
so nerd adam is still here?
I don't think nerd adam ever left tbh
never left
The rest of y'all haven't met me yet
math major basically confirms nerd tbh
im gonna go on the plane in 2 hrs
u got a red eye? That sucks
red eyes are awful good luck
only direct flight available i think
red eye is easy tho
pass out for a few hrs
I have a red eye in a couple hours
My high school music teacher did this until the plane had an issue and they had to get off 💀
See I donâ€™t even need that, I can sleep on command
Can't wait to get 4 hours of sleep and then say fuck it we ball tomorrow
At least it might forcefully fix my sleep
iâ€™m usually a good sleeper and i got maybe 3 hours of sleep on the 7.5 hour flight
I have the opposite problem - the minute I start driving I get eepy (Iâ€™ve never fallen asleep at the wheel or been in a car crash tho)
all the jolting and rolling and acceleration really throws me off so I have to look out the window or else I'll be dead 💀
I can close my eyes and zone out but I can never fully go to sleep
i just hate trying to sleep during take off
except i napped and then woke up at 3am so i kinda broke it in the opposite direction
Thereâ€™s something about moving down the highway at 65 miles an hour in a metal box that keeps me from sleeping for some reason
Yall can sleep in the plane???
If I'm sleepy tired I will be out like a light, but if I'm not tired I'll be very awake
nope I get anxious and can never stay asleep
my neck hurts when i wake up but yes
Traveling just makes me tired so I am always able to fall asleep
> Traveling just makes me tired
same
> so I am always able to fall asleep
not same
I just stay awake for the whole plane ride
Wtf is the military sleep method
Though I will say when I was flying a week after the door plug incident I definitely wasnâ€™t sleeping
idk why theyâ€™re separate there
You see I believe both Alexis and I want to work in a helicopter so sane is relative
I also feel super gross after naps so 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
i can only nap if im sick
it doesnâ€™t make sense for them to be separate in any way
idk bro
I can sleep mostly aight but any amount of noise makes it VERY hard to sleep
I need to find my preferred napping spot early on
Dude same TT I'd get sleepy driving home from school and it was so bad
Fireworks, fire alarm, my alarm, have nothing on me
saaaame as many people who have tried to wake me from a nap in this server can attest to
Imagine not biking home from school
I'm such a sleepy guy. My housemates get a lil annoyed at how long my alarm has to go off before I rise
I wish I could 🥲
Once my roommate locked themselves out of our dorm and was banging on our door to get me to open it but I was out like a light and didnâ€™t hear
i be waking up to this stuff in my camera roll
Blurry car
Bikes are overrated (idk how to ride a bike)
Never too late
I lived far from school ok TT
i want a bike
The obvious answer as to how I don't know how to ride a bike is that I never learned
i can ride without my left hand but not without my right 💀
i know how to ride a bike i just have one in rhode island that i never use
my hometown is very hilly tho
i also crashed my dads bike earlier this summer and spent the rest of the day dazed and with a headache so im not feeling super fond of bikes rn
I'm pretty sure I would hate bike riding so the several hundred dollars of commitment and dozens of hours of time required to do so seems like a waste
i can bike w one hand but not with no hands
Oh shit itâ€™s the 17th
I honestly just think that bike riding sounds terrible
Thatâ€™s fair enough
my bike is broken :D
starting 5th grade school wasnt biking distance anymore, and my parents barely let me go anywhere on my own on account of we lived in downtown baltimore. so it was just if dad took us on a bike ride
is it advisable to never date within the same college
Like. It takes a ton of balance skills and physical effort. The seat is uncomfortable. You're exposed to the elements. Biking on the road can get you killed by one stupid driver. Etc.
Date who you want
Date no one. There is Work to do
I guarantee you will never find me today or tomorrow
i need one person
Alex will be able to find me anywya
No date only work :(((
I can find Adam for you
Find alex, find you
If I want to send my face what's the correct channel
Short mullet cowboy button up? Thatâ€™ll be me tomorrow
We need a dedicated channel for it
Holy shit, Roddy Richh just died
Fuck is that
Sorry?
This feels a little targeted
forgot what it stands for
RIP Juice Wrld
rip
oh
balance eye face arm speech time?
B stands for balance, E is for eyes, F means face, A identifies arm, S stands for speech and T means time is of the essence
aw
Kinda need it
Everyone remember abc:
A 
Bone 
Coming out of the skin is very bad
never knew
Now my stomach is sick
Okay I looked away from this server for two minutes and what the hell
idk iâ€™m tired and i saw coming out and mr brightside
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab and she's having a smoke and I'm taking a drag
This is what happens when you donâ€™t face reveal
Gone on you with a pick and roll. Young laflame he in sicko mode
No one banned anyone ||yet||
Now theyâ€™re going to bed and my stomach is sick
And theyâ€™re going to bed and my stomach is sick and itâ€™s all I. Mg head but sheâ€™s touching his chest now he takes off her dress now LET ME GOOOOOO
ITS KILLING ME
and they say americans donâ€™t have culture
(I am starting to realize now how many lyrics I have misheard)
Bro that song fuckin sucks
OPEN UP MY EAGER EYES
This server will fr go 12 hours with no messages other than â€œthis poll has closed!â€ and then at midnight everyone is online for no reason
Cause we all have broken sleep schedules duh
TIL next year
After the school year starts this server will cut down on activity by about 80%
Thatâ€™s what happened with 25, 26, 27 server
i didnâ€™t know there was a third!
yeah actually its kinda freaking me out theres a bunch of stuff i still want to do here
Had to park my car half a mile away just to go see Falls point
Idk
OH NOOO
The nandos goes crazy tho. I love that shit
thereâ€™s so much to cleveland
Never have I been so lied to
thereâ€™s just so much tho
ur just lame
Late school night walk to East Cleveland
you donâ€™t know what you have
where there is truly nothing to do
Cleveland is a tiny hamlet in the fields, not even qualifying as so much as a village
Full ride doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t be critical of cwru 💀
i donâ€™t like little italy
Also, saying that Case isn't a good school imo tends to be because one does not take advantage of the opportunities provided here. And even if you think the only good opportunity it provides is a place to transfer from, that still clearly has not been taken advantage of 🙂
Adam you might want to reread an argument before you red herring it into something I never said.
Prestiâ€™s goes hard
little italy isnt my fave place i donâ€™t really like italian food that much
Never been there ngl
Are u guys also like going to be depressed the first week or so after u leave and canâ€™t see ur parents for a whole year
Intls move in early
I wasnâ€™t 💀
Anyways the best practice in life is to be critical of everything you see and not respond based on emotion and fallacies. Just because someone hasnâ€™t done something or live up to their argument doesnâ€™t mean their argument is invalid . Hereâ€™s a life lesson for everyone.
Idk how to 💀
itâ€™s a lot tho
the loneliness set in properly for me when it was like 2 weeks into class and had a couple acquaintances but was going most days wihtout speaking a word to anyone bc i didnt have anyone i could comfortably text and ask to get dinner with or whatever
There are some boring parts but overall I found it to be fun
I never got super homesick personally, I've mostly had fun at Case, but it was weird to be away from home for so long
that i never crossed paths with in o week
Yep the away from home is the tough part but atleast the summer holidays are very long
Don't be too worried if you don't find a group to 100% click with immediately
I didnâ€™t really find my people until second semester
not really but i didnâ€™t spend a lot of time in my dorm
ik people that did tho
didnt know half their names
Of my 8 suitemates in freshman year:
2 I'm still close with
3 I'm still friends with 
2 I never talk to
1 I don't like
By lit I mean boring. I spent more time in Tyler than my own dorm
the osu brainrot hasn't left me after all these years
i was just trying to wake up for my 830am RA training
So finding friends = scary
not really tbh
it just kinda happens. and i was never good at making friends before college
I think it wasnâ€™t that bad for me because everyone was looking to make friends
See thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m trying to do
I was born in the US but my family is Asian. I'm not an expert on the international experience but I would say there's definitely gonna be some culture shock, hopefully nothing too wild tho
i had literally no friends for the last year of high school and i had friends by a few weeks in here
idk how that works
college magic
How hard are the academics in CWRU
my hs was competitive as shit
Scary
I mean if u arenâ€™t going for grad school or med school grades donâ€™t matter as much so there is less pressure
College has a different workload setup to high school. You have to be more self disciplined about studying and doing your assignments
Its not even that late tho
I forgot so much shit in the last three months I feel like I will be starting from absolute zero knowledge in my classes
No itâ€™s just really early
no you wonâ€™t
it feels like that all the time
i feel like that every summer
i don't remember anything from last year
i'm really hyped though
i honestly just need something to do since i've been sitting at home for most of the summer
stuff you need to know
they wonâ€™t expect you to be able to recall everything youâ€™ve ever learned
They probably won't be
my stats prof literally reviewed important calc 2 topics and it was a prerequisite for the class
tbh i found case easier than high school because you are able maximize the use of your time
Most freshman classes are not that hard in the grand scheme of things, they're meant to help you adjust to a college workload and expectations
My AP classes in HS were 10X harder than any college class I took.
this except for music theory
i guess for me the workflow is what made things really hard in hs
iâ€™ll take a harder more interesting class over an easier more boring class
I looked at 1 page from the AP test and I was gonna cry even without taking that class
Has anyone here taken a class with Annie Pecastaings? I have her for my freshman seminar
i had a horrible time in ap music theory because the person who was supposed to teach it was a pedophile and got arrested over the summer
hardest classes i have taken by a wide margin
But you get to make your own choices as to what you can and want to handle
Is MATH 122 and PHY 122 hard those are my first sem classes that are not the basic 101
122 hard because calc 2
for example i found orgo really easy which is a class a lot of people find difficult
I mean. They're not totally easy blow off classes. But they aren't incomprehensibly hard. It depends on your skill set, but I know people who've had good and bad times in those classes
I donâ€™t have credits to take an advanced in CS
I didnâ€™t take computer science in school but I do have some programming experience from hackathons but they were two years back and python only
talk to someone about doing csds132 instead of 101
i was gonna bring up biol 216 which is the hardest class iâ€™ve ever taken but i donâ€™t think anyone was having a good time in that one, even the people that ended up with an A
you don't need credit to do 132 last i checked unless they are changing the major
you need 132 to take 233
idk if you are doing the bs or ba but here are the reqs for the bs
Oh my roommate took data structures and hated it
Dunno
I donâ€™t know Java though 132 is beginner friendly still right then I will mostly change to it
Not anymore bucko
data structures is divisive because you have to get both how the structures work and how they map to a computer
I took CS A but I'm not very confident that my school taught it well enough tho tbh
I wish I took IB computer science but was forced to take chemistry instead
My school was weird in that all of my classes were IB
i was supposed to take e&m in my last year of hs but they cancelled the class due to lack of interest and put me in law studies and mythology instead
idk itâ€™s just what they did
Yeah Iâ€™m still very glad I didnâ€™t take that class
idk
they weren't hard afaik
I really should be asleep but am currently unable to do so
cant sleep
I am used to Singapore timings itâ€™s 1:42 pm in the afternoon there so I am wide awake here in Cleveland in my lonely dorm
Aw big rip
especially since cs can get hard and you may be taking classes in areas of it you don't particlarly like, pick something that will brighten up tour day a little
do not walk around alone at 1:30 am
I have only been to the Singapore airport but it's a really nice airport
Good u didnâ€™t enter the country
Don't like Singapore?
I've never been there, what makes you say that tho?
i walk around alone at night sometimes but some places can get a little weird and if you go off campus in some spots it gets shady quickly
campus isn't dangerous but walking around alone at night in a new city is generally a bad idea
Stayed here 11 years in Singapore itâ€™s very convenient very safe and the school was also nice the big problem is the fact that u have to work till ur 80 in this country itâ€™s impossible to retire and itâ€™s one of the most stressful countries all they care about is ur marks they make u work like anything in ur job one of the worst countries in the happiness index I personally think until school life itâ€™s fine but college and working environment there is horrible and the govt is way too strict itâ€™s illegal to chew gum in Singapore
forced to work to 80 is crazy 😭
Yeah because the country is too costly u canâ€™t retire
wtf?!
I got good ice cream in the airport tho
I suppose if u have good public transit a car isnâ€™t necessary
Oh that sucks
And the people of Singapore omg bruh
I lived there my dad was offered citizenship but we rejected cause I didnâ€™t want to go army
apparently my HS history teacher from Singapore is not allowed back into the country or something because he didn't serve in the military
I hate cars all of them should disintegrate
I will always have the RTA's back bc they decided to make a straight line from campus to the airport
It's not horrible once you get a feel for it, I was there for a week and by the end I kinda felt like I could get around
everywhere has its own problems
I was very culture shocked and had a few bad experiences when I first landed but I'm honestly starting to enjoy it here now
I hope it keeps getting better
yeah service in restaurants and hotels way better than any country I have gone in
nyc boo
We got to tip a lot in US though which I have to get used to
This is why my enunciation of the shouted phrase "FUCK you" is impeccable 😌
but you aren't really supposed to tip for fast food only places where they have like a waiter/server
So basically the tip acts as a service charge here
I will generally give 50 cents but thatâ€™s just cause I used to work fast food and those 50 cent tips added up
I mean the tip system sucks we should just pay restaurant staff normal wages
a relative of mine from here told me something similar but I feel bad pressing "No Tip" when the person's right in front of me lol
Dunno
As someone who worked a fast food job I will let u know they in all likelihood donâ€™t care they just want their shift to be over
Idk minimum wage in Ohio
minimum in Ohio is 10.10 last I checked
Damn that little??
Case minimum is higher I think tho
Isnâ€™t that good
Where's Robespierre when you need him
thats awful
wtf?????!!!!
And I thought us minimum wages were bad
construction works fixed price 800sgd a month for 16 hour per day working shift
Service charge goes to the restaurant not to the waiters
That's also pretty bad
WTF????
that's awful 😭
if I worked there I would be pissed
But the waiters donâ€™t do any proper service in Singapore prolly cause they annoyed
it's literally called *service* charges 😭
For me it's the woman who owns falafel cafe. One time I didn't go for a week and she was like "are you okay 🥺"
fr and no service change either
imagine being able to sleep
I'm pulling an all nighter tonight so I can sleep early tomorrow
cries in not moving in until Thursday
I'm leaving on Tuesday
Flight leaving to Cleveland. See you all on the other side
If I throw all of mine away what do they do
4:08 AM: okay that didnâ€™t work
Hey itâ€™s simple Iâ€™ll just put my phone down and not look at it how could it go wrong
Ah goes hard
I leave in an hour and a half
I haven't slept cause I've spent the entire time since like 8 pm packing and stuff
And we leave for Ohio at 4 am
Damn thatâ€™s early
I need to unpack and arrange my room and apartment coz my suite mates arrive in 4 days and everythingâ€™s just strewn around 💀
am I cooked if I miss 2 days of o week
I would recommend not doing so, if you have no choice, contact someone like your RA or OL if you know who they are to find next steps (I forget what office this would be under, but that would also work)
Does not feel real yet
Me at the Cleveland cracker barrel on 2 hours of sleep :newitemacquired:
5 hours god
I hate sitting in cars for prolonged periods of time
Or sitting still in general for prolonged periods of time
Lowkey social anxiety do be kicking in tho
omg
Update I canâ€™t get it til 5pm
oh r yall moving in
Finally some people landing to give me company in this lonely residential house
Where do we go to get it? Schedule only says where to tomorrow
Bro o week was so much shit
Like I was so tired
And I was so tired
I did most things and I was so tired every night
could be worse, could be wasps
Honestly more exhausting than finals
I donâ€™t have an epi pen either
I havenâ€™t been stung since I was like 1 and thatâ€™s when I found out I was allergic
so idek if Iâ€™m allergic anymore but I donâ€™t rly want to find out
damn not you excluding RAs
We gettin on da plane
Man Iâ€™m so exited for my 7 hour layover in Minneapolis
Iâ€™m currently in the car passing through bumfuck nowhere rural Pennsylvania
damn so far
Iâ€™m on a plane
Isnâ€™t that like where you live though 😭
I don't often post on LinkedIn, but this is important to me.

Yesterday, my employee came to me on her lunch break and said: "Adam, I'm so dreadfully sorry that I was 10 minutes late to work today. My son got in a car crash on Friday and I needed the 10 extra minutes of sleep because I pulled two all-nighters to make sure he was okay."

So I had to think: efficiency, or compassion?

I chose both. Instead of firing her, I simply cut her salary to zero and forgot to tell her.

Always remember to have compassion for your employees.

And don't tell your boss you were late by ten minutes on the day he was late by two hours.
Children need a mute button holy shit, I think this is the loudest airplane Iâ€™ve ever been on
they do, it depends how old they are tho
Damn I've been stuck in Chicago for like an hour now so
Thatâ€™s definitely worse
Oh yeah etas increased by half an hour
is there a way to find out which meetings during discover week are mandatory? besides the residence hall ones, it just says they're mandatory
(Wondering, are the expressways still closed?)
in your experience, is the first meeting going to last for two hours for real?
... so my RA didn't really give a crap and we had one hall meeting once, nothing else the entire semester so my experience was really not typical
i have no idea, but I'd guess probably not? I don't go to campus until tomorrow so I'm not entirely sure about anything yet
oh I see, I got mine already but haven't heard anything about a group number 😭
so I'm wondering if I missed something
I was on the skyway about 2 hours ago
I think the weather should be real cool and not rain
Nah there is nothing on the ID
tho
oh dw im international
im a US citizen but spent my whole life abroad
Cause u applied from abroad
I thought the bank is at 2 o clock the college one
we were in before then tho
This one some bank and cell phone fair
ohh I didn't know about that, we're at the Chase branch in the university area
kinda yeah but I got adjusted fast enough since I was young enough
My English was good enough that my middle school just let me continue 6th grade instead of staying a year behind to do ESL classes
side effect is I never felt the effects of growing up really and like feeling more responsible for shit since I have been responsible for shit since 11 💀
Itâ€™s near Cleveland clinic
but idk
that takes so long tho
I donâ€™t have a clue
I really want one but I'm not sure I really need one though
If someone needs a bike past the 21st of August I donâ€™t need mine anymore and itâ€™s basically brand new I used it like 3x 😭😭😭 Iâ€™ll sell it for like $50
omg I want one badly 🥲
are you selling it because you never had to use it?
No I have a car now
So I donâ€™t need it anymore
having a car on campus is goated
If anyone needs a laptop lmkâ€¦ bc I am also selling that
Itâ€™s registered with the cwru police so if someone steals it they have it in their system
Very thereâ€™s bike racks everywhere
Who moving into Clarke tmrw
oof I'm working the morning shift
yayyy I really wanted a bike
And I donâ€™t have notifs for discord
might be able
I have like 8 large moving boxes of stuff and 2 ikea bags in a storage unit and Iâ€™m ngl I donâ€™t think I need any of it
I survived this summer without it living in an apartment
If I donâ€™t touch it by the end of the semester Iâ€™m gonna sell/donate/get rid of all of it
I wish I listened to the ppl that told me to pack very lightly
Do you need help moving it into your room or anything else?
U still there?
just moving it to my room
Um, ackshually, I came to Case with a backpack and a single mismatched sock. Anyone who brings more than 20 pounds of anything is delulu and will never use any of it
I need to downsize
Bro I hate storage units they increased my rate from $50 to $88 without asking me
See this is my thinking is a constant battle with the parental units who wanted to pack me like Iâ€™m going to space for a year (to Adams point)
since im only here for the fall i at least am getting them to downsize a lot since weâ€™ll be moving it out in the cold lol
i am currently stuck in the chase bank with one friend waiting outside and another in the room getting his card and I'm unsure if I should stay or go out 🤣🤣
the rain has come
surely this doesnt happen tmr as well
Ahhh i wanna go back to long island
Seems forecast says otherwise
uh oh
it's not raining on Southside atm?
im in a suburb 20 mins away
they went from 35 to 75 for me too
i walked to and from the quad in the rain with no jacket or umbrella in my oweek
If it does rain, I will be gutturally screaming (no I wonâ€™t)
Apparently you can drop your stuff off in your room today but you don't move in until tomorrow
Only if you chose a time slot for today instead of one for tomorrow
you from near dallas?
they are expanding tho
I need to go
Are many of us who are already here today in Cleveland just not doing much if theyâ€™re not international or early drop off?
im close but have no way to get there at the moment
The idea of college has become so frightening
don't even think about classes yet just focus on settling in this week
i'm in a hotel cuz i move in tmw
Same, im bored out of my skull rn
I mean if I took a couple days and didnâ€™t sleep, yeah sure
no my mom makes pho and his standards are high he'll just sit there like a sad kicked puppy when it doesn't taste like my mom's
if you donâ€™t wanna go that far falafel cafe
is this a favorite of math majors bc it really should be with a name like that
idk iâ€™m not a math major
so what im hearing is that algebra is a favorite of math majors
If I say it does I'm lying and if I say it doesn't I'm rejected
Donâ€™t spend it all in one place
can someone pls help me
What do u need
i cant go in b4 that?
You can, but we wonâ€™t be able to help for a bit
Are people helping with the early drop off rn tho?
Actually nvm donâ€™t answer thatâ€™s a stupid question
Early drop off doesnâ€™t have dedicated volunteers afaik (Iâ€™m answering anyways)
Itâ€™s hot as fuck down here
28 degrees inside my dorm 😭😭😭
Iâ€™m gonna need that in freedom units
How early can I get started moving in if my slot is at 10 am? I feel like itâ€™ll be much easier if Iâ€™m not wresting with a bunch of other people for space
do you still need help?
I assume not since she has not been answering
accidentally took off my shoes cuz I'm so used to it
I can feel the fungus growing
OH
ours has a blue and red for hot and cold
The thermostats in your rooms donâ€™t work
i think they are roughly the same - there is likely some variation (off the top of my head, water fountains vary). Within my own building there is a shower knob that has red = hot and blue = cold, but another one has it reversed for some reason 😭
fair enough
i would but i havent arrived in cleveland yet - maybe another time
wtf itâ€™s only 3 days until I go to Cleveland
I swear I had like a week left
do most dorm rooms have windows you can open actually i forgot to consider that
really regretting it now
is it normal for these things to be really finicky or not work at all 💀
It shuffles fresh air in
our middle one doesn't go higher than that
Everything is kinda shit
honestly tho it's decent here in cutter
could be worse
I wonder who has it this yr the shower is so bad
My freshman year shower was blue hot red cold
idk if my roommate is gonna like my 2 flags and like 5 anime posters
If someone needs a mini fridge I have one they can buy off me for cheap bc I have a full size fridge now
adapt or die
I wish I sold it in May
I wonâ€™t so itâ€™s kinda useless
Idk why
forgot them at home 🥲🥲🥲
I think ppl hate on Clarke too much
is it actually that bad
No theyâ€™re very similar in quality except cutter I think is much nicer
I saw a cutter single and I was SOOOO jealous
Probably I havenâ€™t seen one though
who moving in clarke tmrw
but idk my assignment until i show up
im trying to decide which one i wont hang up
the only one i know that i want is a silent voice and my eren flag
i also really want a frieren poster
but money
which i also need to update
Just realized I forgot my calculator at home
I forgot the charging cable for mine, i guess Iâ€™ll be making an Amazon order pretty soon
bummed i wont be at the fair to be like â€œomg i know you from discord!â€
i would if i could but my flight doesnt get in on time :(
im gonna be exhausted from being at a con all saturday though it wouldnt be a very good first impression lol
This is what made me realize I left my calculator
if iâ€™m at clarke theyâ€™ll have me do like traffic control or some shit
i donâ€™t want to be on traffic control i donâ€™t even know how to drive
what calculator do we need for CS
Iâ€™d prob say a TI-80 series calculator but idk
Graphing calc for the math classes
I never regretted buying it
Iâ€™ve had it since 8th grade
It legit can do most of the math for me
I want one of those so bad but idk if I can justify the cost
Except AIQS
L i guess
I cannot do mental math
Itâ€™s a work expense, obviously
nah i just don't have to do the calculator kind of math
ohhh okay! do yall accept newcomers & do you need to know japanese? (im learning it on the side but im still very beginner)
Iâ€™ve legit used it consistently since 8th grade
Also we prob shouldnâ€™t buy our textbooks just yet right?
we just sit around a screen and watch anime for 2 hours
Most classes u donâ€™t even use the textbook or u can find a free pdf
no because you can find people reselling them on campusgroups
I have spent $0 on textbooks so far
unless they stopped allowing openstax
drew meyer for chem111 shows us openstax (i have never used it)
Canâ€™t remember off the top of my head but I know she was Asian I think for the professor
i used openstax to self study chem and pass the placement exam
fair enough
I havenâ€™t been assigned one yet
oh damn still?
Nope, tho that maybe my fault cuz I also accidentally missed part of the music theory testâ€¦. Soooooâ€¦.
If any of u use the core lab I work there 🔥
That sounds interesting. Tho at the same time, Iâ€™m not sure how much time I have to spare cuz I rly do not want to burn myself out by greeding and piling on way too much stuff all at once
oh thatâ€™s cool I wish Texas had that 😭😭
Iâ€™m bringing it with me this time I hope they donâ€™t try to make me check it at the airport
they might!! i didnt know illinois had that until my HS councilor gave me the tip and i sorted something out with them
Im stuck outside rn
Ouch
if it interests you i would recommend shooting out an email to the ensemble director even if you think you don't have time just to talk about it
just got soaked and ran to dorm
makes sense i can't fault you for that
They only have a version that helps u get a job unfortunately but thanks anyways
aw D:!!! im sorry :(
Wasnâ€™t that sudden though, it was drizzling for a while and then the rain got progressively heavier
i need to buy an umbrella i forgot that the one i have at home is like broken
This happens all the time I hate Cleveland weather
I like rain but not when I have to go somewhere
I got a shit one for $8 on Amazon and it flipped inside out while I was walking from the bus stop to my internship
Just had to run from the car to our Airbnb
Itâ€™s expensive but Iâ€™ve had it since fresh yr of hs and it still holds up great
Literally never flipped inside out
Well katy but close enough
And I hate dragging a wet poncho inside
Nah ur supposed to wear the poncho till u get home
Donâ€™t take it off in class
also make sure yall have rain gear tmw cause move in will go on until it downpours
they donâ€™t have enough ponchos for the families and students
The forecast doesnâ€™t look too bad anyways, maybe a bit of rain, but the afternoon seems clear for now
was someone getting shot at?
Rain
I meant the rain but
Lemme guess either Illinois or Texas
The air bnb host told my mom he has someone routinely drive around our parking lot to make sure nobody's doing anything criminal
Damn
Tho makes sense
Oh yeah, those happen all the time, dw about it
Iâ€™m not short enough to get swept away by the rain (I hope)
Itâ€™s even worse when itâ€™s snowing
I lost my dual citizenship
Iâ€™ll just reclaim it if I ever feel like it
Iâ€™m probably applying for dual citizenship next year once Iâ€™ve had my greencard long enough
aw that sucks
oh yeah i forgot about that
and american citizenship is expensive and hard to get rid of
Took my parents 10 years to get citizenship I think
i had a few bags and my parents took some as well but i probably could've taken less stuff
I can still reclaim it bc of birthright so idrc
Itâ€™s fine with the US I just didnâ€™t go to ZA enough times or some bullshit
it is SO COLD in my room
Basically everything in my room that I used daily I brought with me
Barely fit in the car
Ya my mom worked in labor law in south Africa and she didnâ€™t try to go to American law school when she moved here bc she said thereâ€™s like 0 labor laws to protect workers so whatâ€™s the point 😭
As long as it doesnâ€™t overlap on my schedule I rly wanna join that
mfw China doesn't allow dual citizenship
Set up my laptop and monitor as a makeshift PC for the airbnb
I just have a laptop, mouse, and mousepad and Iâ€™m calling that my â€œgamingâ€ setup
I brought my full PC but it'd be too annoying to set it up just to take it all down tmrw morning before move in
10 hour drive
Mad props to you lmao
I feel like Iâ€™m drinking water out of the air
Crying
this is still the most accurate way to describe the midwest ive ever heard
I'm still hoping they get back to me about the costume shop job
They didnâ€™t even ID
if there is a slot machine near you, you have the same opportunity as a billionare
hypothetically what if i was never caught
Except take it out during winter break
the university issued ac units donâ€™t look like regular ac units
mine did in storrs :) most of them donâ€™t work but thereâ€™s no harm in trying and maybe yours will
But if I think someone is you if I happen to be around Clarke, then sure
no, the fact that I spent money on parking lot and won't even have a car until early September
You must be quite bummed about that to scream constantly
well she doesn't have a choice I suppose
tell me how bad it is to not go to all of the discovery week events and meet ups?
I would say go, but is there a particular reason you donâ€™t want to go?
If something sounds absolutely horrendous you don't have to go (or if you're just tired) but the evening events are largely put on for your benefit
Okay sorry I read that and imagined â€œhey guys Iâ€™m going to stay in my room for a week!â€
Sometimes you want to challenge yourself a bit, but other times, feeling good and comfortable is more important
I'll go for a campus tour for sure as well, I'm so lost
I feel like I'm insane because I've been to case so many times literally
by the way, is there some process of tracking time people get in and out of the dorms? sorry for being obnoxious I've been growing up with a completely different college system in mind
Unless your roommate is waiting when you enter your room and asks â€œwhy are you back so late?â€ every time (which happened to a friend of mine)
Nope
My roommate and I basically didnâ€™t acknowledge each otherâ€™s existence for a month 😔
no I mean if we're serious I understand how it can be too much
sad
Yeah I went with a rando and it could have gone worse
I've been to summer camps so many times I understand this completely
the US still feels like a summer camp honestly
I mean Ohio is a shadowy ethereal realm so it can be whatever you want it to be
My friends call ohio a seperate plane of existence and honestly I think they're right sometimes
oh god it is I've been driving in a thunderstorm today (for context, I have a license for a week)
What happens at the end of the week
I got trapped outside in the thunderstorm
Also bad person to ask I've only been to 3 states
I've been laughing at memes about Ohio for so long before I moved here and oops
I wasnâ€™t even really aware of Ohio memes before I moved here tbh
A friend of mine just yells skibidi ohio at me when college gets brought up 😢
I can't wait to explore downtown tho
Rip
Omg same
I'm already missing food from home 🤣
:( u never know
Russian probably tho
oh I didn't mean to reply, it was intended for the message above lol
I'm not a big fan of both but yeah that too! idk there're lots of stuff but last time I got condensed milk, kvas, some local type of ramen noodles, and picked (is it a word?) tomatoes
Math student amirite
it's usually under 1% I guess so it isn't considered as alcoholic I guess. same with kefir lol
Sorry Adam is a big fan of learning about food
Have ylu cleaned down there yet?
I mean, no one really uses those dorm room bathtubs is all I'm saying ...
The first thing this reminded me of is that I've been getting so many ads for "pickle ketchup" recently and I can't imagine any other taste now 😭
I mean can the alcohol kill whatevers living/growing in there
It's like the bacteria in the water being neutered so it can't breed in our tummies 🤗
this may be the worst sentence I've ever read
It can't duplicate in our stomachs
We've all seen Ben's presentation on how to make a reactor tho
I slept in the car
The coin toss of if I would sleep in the car or not landed on long ass nap
Adam asks me questions and I have answers. If he doesn't like the answers he doesn't get to ask
And technically my body thinks it's almost 12 am bc time zone change
I didn't eat breakfast
yep sorry I didn't see your message earlier 🥲
glad we ran into each other after tho
Juat out of curiosity, was anyone else stuck outside during the rainstorm at like 7
I saw someone who looked vaguely familiar and am wondering if it's from here that I know them
I was stuck outside I ran through the rain cause time was running out to reach the international meet and the rain wasnâ€™t stopping
unless you saw someone wearing a cardboard box it prob wasn't me
Where were you stuck
Near pierce the house next to pierce donâ€™t know the name forgot it
I also saw someone moving back and forth around me
And then ended up sprinting in the rain
oh fair 🤣
gn everyone the sleepy is hitting
3 hours
Still driving, i still got 3h30 💀💀
damn ur juniper
idk i just leave when they tell me to
why is it raining man 😔
the real question is why is it "raining men" ba dum tsk
Can somebody come and tell my parents to fuck off
I donâ€™t see anyone outside rn
rainy
Too much rain for this
Just drove by someone riding a bike
In this weather
He wasn't even moving fast either he's just strolling along
i have been standing outside since 8
lived 3 years without it
They had us come here at 7:45 just to stand in the rain for an hour before ppl show up
i donâ€™t pay for housing tho L
i canâ€™t live off campus cause iâ€™m on need based financial aid
but iâ€™m an RA so i donâ€™t pay for my housing anyway
Cannot find yr tent
iâ€™m not labeled tho
ofc its raining
idk i just work here
iâ€™m almost done tho
nah yeah fair enough
I was supposed to start moving in at 12 but this line lmao
this traffic is AWFUL
12:30 I haven't even gotten close to my dorm
And now it's raining
this is terrible
Like I'm not gonna make someone unload like a 40 pound PC
Exaggeration but still
someone helped me unload a minifridge my freshman year
i didnt see any people in lot 46 with carts 💀
Do we go towards our housing to unpack or are we stuck in the lots
i need to head to maltz but i wanna see campus
Help omg why is this line to the dorms so long
Is it that bad? I havent looked yet
So I guess I'm 1-2
Aw hell okay
it got backed up cause of the rain
bc we stopped when it was pouring
or needs help?
@michael_cjr  is trying to find people to go to the Cleveland Museum of Art if you want to go again lol
First floor lounge in left playing fooseball
Outside Taplin, 3:00, as many people as possible
There most likely wonâ€™t be that many people anyways
donâ€™t disappear en masse
I'm outside taplin
Maybe wrong side
My mom wants
Wtf
its only this bad for a few weeks at the beginning
woke up to rain or snow on my blanket occaionally but we ball
i mean i ate at both last year lol frib is better
i feel like as much as the dining halls are ass the ease of not having to grocery shop, cook, clean up, figure out what to make, etc is really nice
Oh rly
I probably will never know
u can save a few doubloons as a sophomore by being on 10 instead of 17 bc financial aid covers 17
also tommy used to be way worse for lines it was only open for swipes like 12:45-2 or something
idk im not a huge tomlinson fan? local taco is decent but theres essentially no variety, fire grill or whatever doesnt even take swipes, and its great to have subway there but the lines are so long (though im sure theyre better than they were a few years ago)
Moving stuff around my dorm I broke the monitor
Use my laptop as a monitor for now
Oh no :(
it wonâ€™t be so bad after that
Yâ€™all know you donâ€™t have to eat at leutner right you can just Go Places although idk if casecash is loaded yet
If anyone needs food I have chicken tenders in my freezer that could be microwaved 🐓 hmu
Idk im getting food rn
I know Claire and Annabel and if yâ€™all disrespect them Iâ€™ll cry at you really loudly
Idk who either of those people are
if u upset them youâ€™re in the wrong iâ€™m sorry
I made a sandwich and left cus I'm not standing in lines
OMG HELEN
I had Aaron last year for my OL and he was good if anyone has him either
just passed by the line i am so sorry for yall waiting to get into leutner
Yo how are we supposed to know if we need to go to our rain location
If someone important looking tells you to
oh
I am but im not there yet, im getting my water bottle rn
omg roommate mentioned
Guys r we meeting our groups at the rain site or not..?
The rain then lack of rain is confusing me
Dont go to rain site
the magic of a small-ish school
Dont go to the rain site is what im saying
just for the record those leutner lines will last maybe a few more days and then the line will be like 1min long max for the rest of the year
Can I still get my bed lowered (tomorrow, or later in the week?) Iâ€™m realizing that keeping it as high loft was a horrible choice
I don't know if they just didn't do it or
I wanted to be able to put one of my drawers under the desk but I literally can't cus it's so low
The only probably is that I donâ€™t know where I would put my stuff, I feel like with mid I wouldnâ€™t have any space
Atleast me and michael can agree math + something is better than no math
It didnâ€™t?
Oh I misunderstood
Totally didnt loose people a couple times in the museum
Theyre doing nothing yet
God I remember that being so boring last year
Yeah seems like it has ac
Math and geology is the best math combo and I will hear no slander
I haven't put up all my wall decorations yet but the room itself is good
Haven't done my rugs either
There's so many drawers in my room I could never fill all of them
Yeah we get so many drawers but also do you Trust any of them to be clean?
Oh yeah I wiped down all the surfaces it's just that the furniture has that crusty feel to it yknow?
I'm right tho
Idk my freshman year furniture was fine
some of my drawers get stuck if i donâ€™t lift them slightly first
oh when i lived in greek housing my furniture was so bad
Still going
my b i didnt find u earlier btw :(
I didn't bring my bookbag
What do the periods mean on the left side
so you can see ur swipes on transact eaccounts app and see how many are left in each category
Same but my fresher ones were worse
No backpack? Rip
I forgot mine at home lmao
Also she's still here
I mailed an envelope like 8h away from me across the state and it cost $13
Fair enough
The walk actually doesn't feel that bad but maybe that's because I'm surrounded by people
last semester i was getting around 12k each day
anyone feel like walking to rascal house
the day i moved from village house 3 to stj for 9 hours vs my monday as an OL last year
Yo can the people playing volleyball right outside my dorm cut it tf out
Damn
I haven't talked to anyone on my floor besides my roommate
my floor, not even my suite, was never this united throughout the entire semester
It is still almost uncomfortably so
Like there's no outlet near where they put it
wish I got a tower fan or box fan now
The good part is, it should only get cooler (I hope Iâ€™m not wrong about that)
Dont look at next weeks weather unless you want to be sad
how bad will it get next week
Fucking hot
Cleveland in the summer is fucking hot
I much prefer the cold
I sweat very easily and I hate feeling sticky
yeah I guess I have never experienced the cold weather before
Oh buddy
back in Taiwan "cold" is like 15 degrees minimum 💀💀🤣
It canâ€™t be that bad can it
you dont know cold.
It doesnâ€™t always happen but when it does
Same here, this sucks
Cold = good sleep
I want to be buried under blankets and still be chilly
how was moving in for you 😭
yeah best of luck to all the rest of you 😭😭 my brain is fried by the heat even WITH a/c so i can't imagine without,,,
Sorry this is late and really random but we had the exact same issue I feel your pain 😭
We had outlets everywhere except where we actually needed them
the outlet placements suck
Quantity is honestly not bad though at least
Just sucks everywhere ig lol
My roommate tried to shower last night and she said there was no hot water
It's possible that your shower is made so that blue is hot water and red is cold
Also possible that if she showered late that the hot water was gone for the time being
There is normally hot water for showers here though
Yeah idk it depends but if a bunch of people took long hot showers in the building right before she showered that could have contributed
Yeah Iâ€™m aware of the kinda impending doom that awaits me lmao I spent like 3 hours during the summer just meticulously figuring out what courses I need to take
Tho if you run you could prob cut it down to 10
could never
It probably will, just be careful in the rain and snow
Math and geology is not a super straightforward double major, but it's not as rough as trying to do something like cs or compe music
how does package delivery work normally? does amazon just throw them outside of the dorm building?
Packages to nrv go to the wade area office
99% of the time yes, occasionally they screw up but that's what's supposed to happen
If you're particularly worried you can address it to wade instead
Anyone elseâ€™s case registered WiFi not work still
My mom already planned on bringing me back for doctors appointments this only would've been useful for if I broke my arm or something
Also printers and stuff that canâ€™t connect to wireless
sorry about all the questions 😭
varies person by person. i didnâ€™t really use them but ik people who do if they just donâ€™t feel like walking back from the library/train station/etc
10 hour drive so
if that doesnâ€™t happen by the end of first semester i would probably start looking into local options
Yâ€™allâ€™s if you got the flashlight from the health booth at the fair maybe donâ€™t use it mine got really hot just now and one of the batteries like exploded?
And the flashlight did not work
my year they gave me a phone battery pack that almost burned me when i tried to use it
thats just my phone bc i have an iphone 15 🤩
Ive never had Panera in my life
Idk why people like it so much
havent had panera since it gave me food poisoning
Math and CS but I do it better
How to fix wifi: https://its-services.case.edu/my-case-identity/syncADpasswd/
Bro isnâ€™t even a math major heâ€™s just cs ||im trying to get him to join us||
Okay until you pick up a math major as well I don't want to hear any "I'm doing it better" talk
I actually haven't written significant code in a few weeks
math majors 🤓
Um ackshually clearly you haven't read the rules of this server (rules.txt [500 MB])
Fucking outted lmaooo
Iâ€™ve also done running on my own before so idk the actual time
correspondingly longer to veale bc its on the far end of the quad but i didnt go there enough to know how long it takes
Oh shit I need to put up my Squidward
ive been told that forever, including abt my bedroom at home. changing that this year i hope
I still need to put up posters
I have a little whiteboard tho
Theyâ€™re stuck in there with you
I have an extra national parks poster if you want it?
also decorating is a progressive thing. i only have one poster on my wall that iâ€™ve had since i moved in. everything else ive acquired over the years
if you dont need to use the money on your wepa account (the printing stations all over campus) or need to burn it before the semester ends and it resets you can print a bunch of color photos to tape up too
im dead tired and the big events haven't even started yet
Yeah I'm in the third to last row on the left
now im gna end up falling back asleep lmao
I need to find all 20 of me
How bad would it be to just leave this thing right now
Probably kinda bad
im very bored
Iâ€™m gonna go rawdog starting now
So we should all get up and leave at the same time
that would be so bad tho
I donâ€™t understand why we are getting a trauma session rn, did I miss something?
im so tired
id feel bad if i sleep tho
Okay I have stopped letting her cook
I wasn't paying attention
ive been slipping in and out of sleep
this is the most boring thing ever
I fell asleep accidentally 😭😭😭
im so tired
i want to sleep so bad
i wanted to get coffeeeee
One of my classes just got changed today by 4 hours wtf
i want to SLEEP
I napped just now and feel more awake
Idk what I'm doing here
They said something about parents to the left and students to the right 😭
Might leave early

I coulda gone to leutner atp
This line is TERRIBLE
Guys I just got to thwimg this is horrible
Where is the end of the line??????
I already ate and Iâ€™m on my way back to my dorm
I'm too far in to just go back
Cus im inside thwing
If I was still outside I'd just leave 😭

Oh shit we going out
Thereâ€™s nothing interest happening down there cause thereâ€™s so many of yâ€™all
Im so tired 😭 im about to fall asleep standing up atp
I swear I hear thunderclaps though
Also it is cold as balls here with the wind
it's never gonna end guys
If it rains i need to leave the area cause i cant get my hearing aids wet 😭
Dude the line isnt getting visibly smaller
It just keeps going
I fell asleep so I donâ€™t remember properly during convocation
I remember almost dozing off. I didnâ€™t stay for the speaker
not bad btw
Damn thats crazy
Thereâ€™s still no end in sight to the lineâ€¦
and someone is still in line
OMG WE CAN SEE THE END
😭 MY BAD
I don't even know tbh
Very edge of the bleachers slightly to the left of the 50 yard mark
the end is fake
Oh no
Whats that supposed to mean
We have an hour and a half left
What happened last year
I donâ€™t think anyone will tell us
Note to self: donâ€™t wake up at 7 after you went to sleep at 1:40 or smtg
the surprise is the rain that can start in any minute
Babs weather machine
TT me and you both I went to bed at 1 and woke up at 6:40ish
I have a 8:25 am class too at Monday and Wednesday too 😭
what class
We suffer together I have 8 ams all week except friday
I DIDNT HAVE A CHOICE
Literally the exact same, its terrible
I ended up sleeping at like 3 cause of the heat, but I just slept in lol
Guys if you want a hint at whats about to happen look at your id
Iâ€™m used to it tho
Except yeva cause i already did
Nope got nursing orientation
the idea is to stand up and scream I guess
Awful idea
Damn
Yeah ive been unlucky in my timing tho
Holy shit how long is this gonna take
What day tho
Another hour twenty apparently
Why did the whole line slow down so much even tho theres so little left
Our suffering is their delight apparently
I love how the class isnâ€™t even that big but itâ€™s taking so goddamn long
Iâ€™ll see you, and Iâ€™ll be dead that day lmaooo
And idk
Never thought I'd say this but I kinda miss the hot and stuffy dorm rooms rn I'm cold :(
But I guess thatâ€™s how it goes
SORRY LOL
Which section is being lame
Id be having fun if it wasnt at 8pm after everything today
Training (Iâ€™m used to working with rambunctious 5 to 12 year olds so I have a bit more in reserve)
Nope
No like pls I need the speaker to stagger their sentences the echo makes this whole thing incoherent
Dude what the hell is the music im crying
IM DEAD BRO WHAT
This would be cooler if the sound system wasnâ€™t busted to high hell
Whatd they spell out i cant see
Have you guys taken the picture yet
Not yet
Not yet
Oh no*
Look at the top of the bleachers for someone w a camera thatâ€™s me
We canâ€™t see the announcers box from the bottom bleacher cuz Iâ€™m underneath it
if you understand what they say during that event youre doing it wrong tbh
Robin apparently
Iâ€™m not even on campus yet
They put mad work into that
I wasnt expecting that at all
They work on it so much and keep it a secret every year
wow that's a ton of work
anyone here hungry 💀
is the den open yet
i went like 4 times last year
twice just bc leutner closed on me (i kept forgetting weekend hours were shorter than week hours) and then the other two times bc i felt like i should see what the hype is about
noooooo I was hoping it was open
i get free leutner this week and i havenâ€™t been yet 😭 i donâ€™t like it
sad 😭
i have groceries tho but i also have my supervisors guilt tripping me into going to leutner
It seriously is tho, like everything just looked so much better
so sad that it's on the other side of campus
but i am also so far away
Sounds horrible
I was late for small group cuz of that
oh you donâ€™t know pierogi
it's thick I almost broke a tooth
I ate a quarter and now I feel sick
dont throw up
unfortunately trader joeâ€™s is an hour and a half on the bus
but I ate it way too fast
sad
my roommate has a car tho âœ¨âœ¨
but she wasnâ€™t with me this summer
she moves in on wednesday 🤭🤭 i miss her
for most of the day today I've just been consuming sugar to stay awake 💀💀
I got so much from the info fair
You cannot tell me anything worse than a brick of cold bow tie pasta with sour tomato sauce paired with sour coffee is worse *cough cough interlochen*
dont develop diabetes 😭
Idk
back when i was a freshman people would play volleyball outside of taplin until like 2am during o week
i only drink it for the taste because it doesnt work for me 💀
If someone needs me to give them a reason to run I can (Iâ€™m a gremlin and a maniac when I want to)
i go home and im sad bc thereâ€™s barely anything
the indian restaurant in my hometown tho. gas.
Thereâ€™s one close by on Euclid I think
donâ€™t call it that
Damn lmao
the h doesnâ€™t exist
how do you say leutner tho
idk
Iâ€™ve been saying it as lootner but itâ€™s supposed to be letner right?
idk
you have to clean it yourself tho right
i cant sleep without showering 🥲
which is like. the only thing that really needs cleaning
so our living room/bedroom was very clean
i prefer to shower in the morning as well but i get worried that the noise will wake people up
Third bag of chips are being opened Iâ€™m gonna be a fatass lmao cuz I burn thru calories so quickly
wont burning through calories quickly be a good thing
Yes except Iâ€™m no longer doing and teaching martial arts for like 4 hours everyday
im actually in a juniper corner double rn tho so i really shouldnt be complaining 💀
If itâ€™s not clear enough yet, Iâ€™m kinda unhinged lmao
this would go hard on my wall
omg framework laptop?
i want one
i need some decorations
but i didnt get one before i left
The one downside is that windows sleep mode is kinda stupid sometimes so it doesnâ€™t go to sleep when you put it to sleep
small price to pay for a good laptop system though 🙏
Itâ€™s more of a windows issues tho rather than an actual laptop issue
yeah fair 💀
I didnâ€™t ask for an AI tool to be in my windows, nor do I want to search up stuff using my search function. I have to go into the REGISTRY to disable it itâ€™s so stupid
im all for AI advancement but i dont like companies just shoving it everywhere and expecting people to use it
i'm so bored
dont think so
Iâ€™m watching a guy attempt to fix a storage drive and activate the sonic OS
what happened
omg bringus studios
Okay good, I was gonna lose my shit if thatâ€™s how people actually referred to it like that
It's okay, if you want good pho go to pho and rice in Coventry, it's pretty close to one of the bus lines
Iâ€™m guessing real good Japanese is hard to come by tho
i heard theres sushi in tomlinson but
sushi is very hit or miss for me
missed dinner cuz of RA meetings and tradition
It's not bad, but I always find myself a little disappointed 😭
i'm not high, i'm just fat
Had actual crap so I could go to the gym
not actually but i'm so fucking hungry
Rascal house and eurowaffel (normally but they might be closed Mondays)
If you want a cookie
i want a meall 😭
maybe but i dont have a bowl
i have ramen packtes too tho
but i dont wanna bust those out yet
Iâ€™m sweaty from the gym tho
Or do you want popcorn I have that too
Walking back from jim tho
Lamont you can hungry
Tbh rascal house is the best hungry option at this hour
don't want to steal your food
I got you tho
My dad got it dw
Based doesnâ€™t mean I agree, just means I respect it
Alan or Leo you want chicken tendies?
I need to get through them before expiration somehow
Fribley had them today, cant say for leutner
So average math major FUMBLE
Damn, so I cannot do that
Alex has just started undergrad, so numbers above a dozen or so are fuzzy but still distinguishable with some effort
The cookies are hit or miss is what I'm saying
The average math major can integrate and derive but fail at basic addition and counting
axel is one misread away from being the 21st
But heâ€™s taken a ton of classes already?
Still decent enough if Iâ€™m hungry or wanting a snack, Iâ€™m not too picky
As long as itâ€™s not bricks and itâ€™s sweetness isnâ€™t overpowering Iâ€™d consider it a cookie, tho I could be proven wrong lmao
There is! Go down the stairs instead of up
I saw it but it seemed completely barren so I assumed it wasn't open
I dont think it opens till next week
The lines at leutner are awful
The socializing is killing me, its so many people
No like I go and get in but then the lines to get food are just as bad as to get into the building
We were next to the Tri Sigs on the left side, where were y'all
I got food and immediately left
Once again ignored the pulled pork cus I don't like that
Iâ€™m at the door
The airport code for Nashville is in fact BNA
NAS is actually taken by Nassau, Bahamas
You need to get let in?
starkman <3 i had such a bad time in 122 EXCEPT for the one lecture that he taught. youâ€™ll be in good hands
Wonderful 10/10 I don't know what any of that is except for Texas instruments I approve as a member of the alphabet mafia
They want you to think that
Damn so ur telling me that in engineering there's a random appliance to weapons pipeline
Tho at a school like this I feel some people here already knows about the existence of Nokia bell labs
I swear I need to run into someone who knows of the YouTuber BobbyBrocolli here
Birds arenâ€™t real
Broke: Birds aren't real 
Woke: Birds are real, they just choose to be servants to bureaucracy
Not a bad idea 😭
If the tv downstairs doesnâ€™t work we can either go up to my dorm or i can bring my tv down
ive woken up way too early
and i cannot get back asleep
oh dear
leutner feels a little less packed today
Is it just me or is the WiFi being really weird- some things work but other things donâ€™t
Try switching to a different network if it doesnâ€™t work on the one youâ€™re using
I really should not be awake right now
So then donâ€™t be
If Utech canâ€™t figure out someone mining crypto then weâ€™re all doomed
This makes it really hard to do my job
How am I this tired ;-;
you wonâ€™t be this busy during school
Don't overdose caffeine 😭
Mood tho
You canâ€™t really â€œoverdoseâ€ on caffeine
Itâ€™s caffeine toxicity, and happens when you reach some stupid level like 1000mg
(No I wonâ€™t, chest pain from already sleep deprivation and too much caffeine will prevent me if I do)
I didn't eat breakfast lmfao
Nope
This is exhausting, and Iâ€™m cutting back on my caffeine consumption as much as I can rn
Do not want this class anymore 😭

i was getting ready to sit down and do this homework the asl prof assigned us and then i read the syllabus
Iâ€™ve been considering doing a double major with geology but that feels like a lot
You canâ€™t be worse than me lmao
(Iâ€™ve checked and I have a total combined required credit hour of 141)
I'm managing math and environmental geology together
How does that even work lol
Damn that sounds rough 💀
Oh those were supposed to send earlier lol
Intended as response to this but wifi bad
How does what work?
Starting to feel like it fs
oh damn i cant drop it
Oh you might not be able to change it until Sunday or Monday
Oh or tomorrow
I may or may not have panic emailed my advisor by accident (sheâ€™s so kind I feel so bad she has to deal with my dumb antics some times)
its kind of a shame the only asl teacher conflicts with what i'd like in a prof but
i emailed my advisor she never responded
Wildly enough, I think one of my friends had an ableist experience with the ASL professor last year
Did she break her collarbone? I remember someone saying theirs broke theirs so
Iirc he said that she didn't respect his testing accommodations and might have also had some issues because he was in and out of the hospital a lot
she sent me emails after about registration opening so no i think she just didnt see the email or ignored it
Don't quote me on the second part because that may have been another prof he was complaining about
she doesnt care about reasoning if you're out for any reason past 2 absences its 5 points off ur grade
Tho equally put Iâ€™m curious what those complaints were
its also physics so its a 50/50 chance of it being a bad prof and them being upset cus physics
sheâ€™s not that bad
youâ€™re never going to interact with her if you donâ€™t directly have her as your lecture prof
People don't like the physics lab but mostly because it's time consuming, tedious, and sometimes confusing
```More than two absences (for any reason including technology issues/Wi-Fi
issues) will result in 5 points off each absence, off your final average. If you have two absences
for any reason with a legitimate excuse and end up missing a third class, fourth class, etc due to
ANY issue, that will still result in 5 points off your final average. ```
My friend was like "she's literally deaf, how is she still ableist"
If itâ€™s just electricity, and magnetism separately itâ€™s not too bad. Together is hell
Idk Harsh office hours were the goat for e&m
That's mostly because I was bad at mech tho
But I still got an A 😎
Tho to be fair I took it in HS and my teacher kinda sped thru the whole course cuz of time constraints and stuff
If you already took it in high school it will feel easier in college
If anyone needs calc help I did bring my thicc calc bc binder
A few things here-- 
1. Most professors are scarier in the syllabus than they are IRL. ASL is a big class and so the prof has to come down hard on absences and stuff. If you talk with them in person, they're probably a much nicer individual than it immediately seems. 
2. The plain clothes thing in ASL is a big one. It just makes it easier to see your signs. Watching someone sign with a hawaiian shirt on or smth is actually painful (I did ASL for 4 years and this is totally reasonable)
fair enough. Take care of yourself and don't do what doesn't feel comfortable
people just are mean about it bc they donâ€™t want to do the work and donâ€™t know where to put their frustrations
the labs can feel very pointless and outdated at times, but Driscoll never felt like a bad person or anything. Just hope you get a good TA and get ready to slog through some lab reports
imo. the lab reports for mechanics are worse but the labs themselves arenâ€™t bad. lab reports for e&m arenâ€™t bad but the labs ARE
Replacing our lowest midterm exam with our final exam grade is unbelievably based
you lost me
speaking of - which street is the bookstore on? Or what landmark is it near
I've just never sat down and done it
okay limited time deal: my carbon copy notebook is missing two pages. I will sell it for $15 OBO. i bought it for like 19
you shouldnâ€™t have to take chem lab
damn
Chem 111 tho
regardless you shouldnâ€™t need a CC notebook for chem lab
itâ€™s prob the chem with the discussion im prob remembering it wrong
But you won't need the lab portion
113 is not bad
Also can I be brain dead for my cardio fitness class on Monday and Wednesday morning
I think Iâ€™ve lost my id yâ€™allâ€™s 💀
Oh naur
Did you leave it in your room or did it just vanish somewhere
U could get a temp one at wade if you genuinely lost it
I swear to gods it was in my wallet and by the time we got back to the dorm it was gone
It may have fallen out. You can hope that someone will take it to a lost and found (luckily it has your name on it) but you might need to just get a new one
I know there's one in tink, idk if there's another one
Oh shit I responded to wrong message
Ah yeah labs are always a pain to schedule I wish u luck
Would i get weird looks if i went to fribley rn to get lunch
It's on the schedule for discover week and bc leutner is close to the shuttle puck up for hec
Im getting close to the actual picture area
We just left Iâ€™m so sorry
Aww
still got mitchells then 💪
We'll still have Mitchell's
Even in our darkest hours
yeah donâ€™t put it there
you lose your name tag you lose your id
Not connected to what I just said but they want a bachelor's degree for an internship??
They're supposed to get experience from you
bro im still in the damn photo thing
Im so bored

It wasnt worth it but it was still fun
Who is still waiting here
almost at the end tho
im still a ways out

What no u dont
You Saw Nothing
how much longer
theres like a little piece inside the actual area you go
Itâ€™s so boring ;-;
its like this weird activity where we had to like make a self portrait and then write some things about who we hope to be seen as and then theyre waiting in line to get "authentic" photos taken
Am I able to see you potentially
you still got maybe 30-40 minutes
holy crap its alan
Damn

i dont remember dear world being a thing last year?
I donâ€™t think it was for us
i donâ€™t think they did it last year but it was done both years before
damn
I don't think it happened my year
What's SAF sorry
student activity fair
are yall still doing smash?
Yeah apparently
I just didn't go
Jackbox in cutter!!! Come over if yall want
does wade close?
Work day thingy
I don't have formal clothes and I also can't afford them and I also don't want to be walking around with a near empty resume in my hand
just fyi the mather center will have a dress for success event at some point in the semester where they sell super affordable formal clothes! the mather center is the womens center so its probably mostly womens clothes, but ive heard theres men's stuff there as well (i havent been able to make it there myself to check)
yeah there are far fewer math intendees than i expected
Pure or applied math enjoyer?
@idkwutmyusernameis2931 is there some problem with math people? 🙂🙂🙂
i don't like to box myself in too much but i don't have any desire to work for a company so applications aren't very appealing
Yes, renounce the worldly lifestyle for a life of no money and working out theorems
does 11451 Juniper Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 work for wade commons
aww i have the session before you then
OH
Bro you told someone turn around because you saw them on Discord 😭 you are not one to talk lmfao
i don't quite know what to expect
guys iâ€™m so scared to email my residents what if they all hate me
i'm hoping that i'll also take math 124, i took calc 2 in high school and lin alg over my gap year so i want a more mathy math
Just be an asshole in your first email to *make sure* they hate you and eliminate the uncertainty of not knowing 🥰
I donâ€™t think they will queen
Oh!
U didnt show up to jackbox earlier
You canâ€™t talk
Yeah Adam math and cs irl
Why canâ€™t I talk
Was I invited (Iâ€™m so sorry)
Nah but i still havent met u and i met sm people today
You are unbanned on the basis of me not knowing why I originally banned u sorry man
Aight someone lied to me
Wade is closed
I WANT to
I WANT to be at 5 places at once
The area office is closed
Sorry for the confusion
u gotta find me before classes begin
You did give away you were short
sorry i had to go wave my flag king
well i guess i said i was short here before that
They donâ€™t want you to meet
Look I am short too so I can share the pain
Is your bf active in the class of 28 Discord??? Didnâ€™t think so
Sad
he doesnâ€™t even go here anymore leave him alone 💀
im joking of course but i was intimidated by u for some reason hannah idk why
is it cause iâ€™m old
And minor detail heâ€™s working about 14 hours a day?
You donâ€™t look it
could be worse. my sister is a middle school teacher and sheâ€™s been âœ¨mistaken for a studentâœ¨
hows your back feeling
I am dead tired but-
going to insomnia while tired is the whole point
Idk if I'm going to that baseball game
yeahhhh i get that - im very bad with texting signals & etiquette so i wasnt sure how to interpret it!
oh no iâ€™m definitely not trying to be mean and when i answer questions itâ€™s less specifically at one person and more just. hey this is what everyone needs to follow
I want to meet u Hannah except idk if Iâ€™ve met you before I donâ€™t know
and you just donâ€™t know it
I don't think I've seen anyone in this discord besides arda and axel
IM SO SORRY
This does not but I will keep my eyes open and my brain turned off as always
i cant even make a picture
Idk I keep getting random compliments from strangers about my outfit or my beanie
I took a sleep by mistake so no!!!
Remember to close your window when it's gonna rain
as long as we arent loud its fine
Courtesy hours r only for noise iirc
You can if you want
Fair warning Iâ€™m real out of it
nahhhh im pretty tired , i need to sleep soon cause tmrw is a big day and thats not because its my birthday
axel are you still walking over
Otherwise I can actually come I donâ€™t mean to keep you waiting man
It's specifically supposed to be anonymous because if you just start, you get to look at the confusion because no one has any idea who they're singing to
Oh yeah took you like 10 minutes before you introduced yourself during mario kart
yeahhhh my bad
Math surprises me (but not in a bad way)
Which class then
Idk I didn't live there
Iâ€™ve yet to meet a single CS major
Oh
I donâ€™t think so or maybe I havenâ€™t connected it yet
CS majors are really not that rare
You have probably just had bad luck
It really is like that sometimes though, fr
Donâ€™t tempt me
But still
No it ain't
They do not need to see the caps
Isnâ€™t that freshman housing?
most are prob asleep like normal people tho
CS and nursing are close, and then the other three I mentioned are close to each other
stay up then sleep through entire plane ride
Biggest majors:
- Math
- Applied math
- Stats
i havent been to clarke
is it that bad?
isnâ€™t triangle off campus
Wtf
i remember that from the insta gc last year too doesnâ€™t it get tedious to keep making new accounts
fair enough
fair
i hate being close to chipotle im gonna spend so much money
havent yet it isnt open
havent been yet idk where that is
my team ran it
nope i leave friday
i hate you
Did they convert it cuz no sophomore wanted it or smtg lmao
I had to go early
Sorry 😔
they want all the sophomores on southside
What if i go to fribley instead
sophomores used to want to be in clarke bc it was significantly cheaper and also it was before sophomores could live in stj
i will find you 🙂
noooo plssss i need stj next year plsss
at least we donâ€™t have triples yall
i truly donâ€™t know if theyâ€™ll let sophomores in stj next year
cause idk if fayette and noyes are at full capacity
if stj isnt available for sophomores next year whats the next top choice
no AC but you donâ€™t need AC here tbh
my walk to class was so short when i lived in tippit
i think if you want sophomore dorm sophomore dorm chances are highest
bc a lot of people donâ€™t want southside
which is why i didnâ€™t put it. did not want to be top of the hill
like. most of the freshman dorms are the same. the biggest difference is room size but if youâ€™re in a single it doesnâ€™t really matter too much. upperclass itâ€™s all the same p much. sye? you could have suite or corridor. top of the hill or bottom. no kitchen or kitchen
bc you canâ€™t indicate preferences for community
My college is paid :yippe:
Now I'm just poor and not getting a refund :stare:
fuck yeah
i didnâ€™t realize he taught the 100 level classes
I have mihos for astronomy 101

connamacher for csds 132

Horst for math 

Parris for posc 109

And jenkinson for sociology 101
for math 201 i assume?
anyone know how to find your laundry room for the app?
i used to like southside i got sick of it last year after all of my friends moved to northside
Which seems to not be the case for the RAs who live Southside
Me personally I hate the elephant stairs and how far away from PBL it is
I don't see either of those
We don't actually get case cash until after discover week
Working in the botanical gardens
Idk
Oh
If anyone wants to hang out just lmk
They unfortunately have us ridiculously over scheduled
OH
Oh
My keyboard is in Italian I donâ€™t get spellcheck anymore 🥲🥲
OMG anyone want to play cards
Phone or laptop?
And what device cause u should be able to swap keyboards
Phone
Which is a pain in the ass
I have a Greek keyboard for typing math 💀
And I used to have cyrillic but I didnâ€™t use it often enough
Still an noble effort
Hiya, didn't realize it was active here
Iâ€™m trying to connect my switch but it wonâ€™t work
Except wouldnâ€™t it be ÎµÎ½Î³Î»Î¹Ï‚? Phonetically?
/Å‹/ isn't always <ng>
I donâ€™t know Greek pronunciation at all I just know the vague correspondence to Latin script
I know youâ€™re in recovery but come on, one language canâ€™t hurt
Yo I havenâ€™t thought about bomofo in years holy shit
I'm not on site though so
Wireless is working for me now
Yeah wireless is working for me
Registered isnâ€™t working for my switch
Itâ€™s prob slow rn then
by the way since nobody here seems to read bpmf, this was also an approximation of english
like I dunno how else you would do it
Maybe at the library? Idk
Why are the Leutner sugar cookies feeling like eating soft bricks
It just bugs me lmao, cuz I expect a cookie to be decently soft and then I feel like Iâ€™m gonna crack my teeth on some
:0 I did not sadly
Yeah it's fair to be disappointed, sometimes they're better than others but if you want a good cookie go to insomnia
goodness thw wifi sucks
literally i cant even add my switch to the case registered thing
This is a picture someone grabbed once over the summer
... aaaaaaand I can't think of a good rhyme!
Youâ€™re actually awful 😭😭😭
I am sadly back on campus
so sorry for your loss
Did anyone lose an AirPod outside Veale Center?
Guys for the baseball game on Friday when registering it keeps coming one field is not properly formatted
oh yeah i went there for a bit. don't know why we went there tho my mother's already seen it
Idk, veale wasn't too crowded today tho, so if people want to beat the wyant crowds that's the move right now
He will be missed :(
Thinkbox is not yet open to the public I think
Lmfao sure just not rn my back hurts cause I sat down cataloguing books for too long
U weâ€™re holding the door and then just got crushed
Idk if that actually happened
Is the cataloging something that needs cs skills?
Now im scared to open the door
What does this spinach sandwich make you guys feel
Probably couldâ€™ve been prevented but we didnâ€™t think that far ahead
Orbeez got really big at my high school for like a month and then a guy dumped them down one of the sinks and caused long term damage to the plumbing 😭
Never seen that before
Sometimes life isn't about what you should do, but about what you can do
One of my most bit committed friends in high school once ate a dog treat for a quarter
(the dog treat costed a quarter)
((he broke even))
my gender realization occcured when I realized I couldn't be a woman for the bit
i ate a 20 million Scoville gummy bear once on a dare
tbf I feel like all of us have a similar story in that regard... mine occurred after my friends put a bunch of minecraft eggs in my main chest in a shared server
I have vans that I haven't worn once since coming here
Oh there were more
the fuck lmaooo
There were a few others that were unfortunately undocumented
I think he took them home
idk if i need to say this but i heard people talking about it
Idk how much this is gonna remain the case but
Was that supposed to be red as the person or red as in the shoe 💀
This is actually making me sick. Iâ€™m genuinely about to throw up
fair
now im worried that calc 2 is gonna kill me because i barely remember calc 1 from ap calc AB
even if you think you donâ€™t remember it the info you need will come back
its been a year since ap calc AB
and for some reason our teacher really hated my class
Just remember to go to sleep early enough so youâ€™re not sleep deprived for it 😭
fair omg 💀
i used to sleep from 3:00 to 6:50
i didnt 💀
was just dead most of the time
all nighters are fever dreams
me considering pulling all nighters on call bc iâ€™m a dead sleeper
regular all nighters sounds absolutely terrible
and i donâ€™t have class the next day (but do have lab)
but i probably wonâ€™t
first one ill sleep tho
i called my RA yesterday since someone else in a single got locked out
maybe they arent on call yet this week tho
oh! so
it went to voicemail
building doesnâ€™t matter
he seems chill
their RA specifically doesnâ€™t matter for this situation
oh so wade was open?
Isnâ€™t RA on call late night
sorry
idk if thats pm or am
My ra straight up told us they don't answer calls
wade shouldnâ€™t have been open
oh
i feel bad now
un so! theyre supposed to
Idk
the guy got locked out and we tried knocking and then calling
They told us they don't answer calls from unknown numbers and so we have to text them or else they probably won't pick up
no response so i said he could try going to wade for a card but i didnt konw it was closed by then 😭
I thought about trying to be the RA for 4th floor Cutler next year but like on call probably wouldn't work with a deaf person
sad
fair i see
@.littlejimmy want to go abduct ice cream from leutner?
surely with technology it's possible to work something out
A phone still vibrates and shows a message on screen.
Yeah but I mean for when I'm asleep
If I'm awake I'm not missing a call yeah but
that's fair
I'm sure there's a way you could work it out, but I get the hassle
I tend to wake up 7-8 without the use of an alarm clock so I just never needed it
damn I wish I could do that
I wake up at 2 without intervention
Calls though it's different my mom once called me like 5 times and I missed all of them cause I was asleep
same once im asleep im out
thatâ€™s why iâ€™m nervous about being on call but apparently the phone is LOUD
and itâ€™s not an iphone so i donâ€™t know how to stop the noise. i know how to turn off my alarms in my sleep
while asleep?
omg 🤣
me and my roommate slept through four max volume alarms directly next to my ear and missed class before
i accidentally did the sos feature on my phone trying to turn off the alarm
had to call non emergency line to make sure i didn't get 911 dispatched
iâ€™ve actually stood up and turned off an alarm before in my sleep
i was really tired tho
u need to get one of the apps that makes you do a math problem or a puzzle to turn off the alarm
my problem is i don't have coordination after i wake up so i've thrown my phone across the room onto the floor trying to pick it up to turn off the alarm
and then almost fall out of bed trying to get to it
i truly donâ€™t know how i ever lived in a double
bc again i knew i had to wake up bc i didnâ€™t wanna annoy her
i sleep in a closet so the sound doesn't travel as much at night
my bf said he was gonna sleep in his closet bc he has the opposite problem from me and is a very light sleeper. so he just wants darkness bc any amount of light wakes him up
which kinda makes me wish he still went here so i could just make him stay with me when im on call 💀
does that happen for some of them???
oh...
pain
the blinds let in enough natural light tho tbh
itâ€™s not a big deal to just have them closed
fair yeah
i need like 10 more feet tho 💀
rip desk area
I guess my grandma ass needs a bedtime 😔😔😔
lol and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that!
I am an eepy sleepy man
Jolly after Michael just graduated will be weird though
@rsgsockcheck you can't just go around robin people robin
Oh oh oh, I'm a pro at this!
You have not printed it yet
You need to log into one of the physical printers (which exist in Wade) and then the rocket ship icon in the upper right will (turn purple?) I think
if the mandel school is at the job fair they are absolutely lovely and i highly recommend :)
the job fair isn't for another month
# CHARLES "THE MAN" LASTNAME
# WORK EXPERIENCE: FAFO
# SKILLS: ALL OF THEM.
Truly brat job fair
Something messed up just happened
Just roll up to job fair today with ur brat resume and brat outfit +infinity aura
I tried to take my peanut butter crackers out of their plastic package but instead of the cracker moving out of the package it splintered into a bunch of fragments
I was like â€œwhere in the fuck was this batshit acronymâ€ and then I looked at the corner
to those who are in phys 123 or phys 121, look at the canvas classroom before classes begin and your lab day shows up - theres some things you need to do before you enter
the career fair is in a month
this is the campus job fair
you donâ€™t need your address on your resume
i donâ€™t have mine
Welp guess the people who get mine are gonna dox me /j
omg everything everywhere mentioned?
oh true tho those were yuck
I still need to watch Memento tho
and I don't think I disliked any of his movies
it's really confusing ig
I guess its just a hard thing to grasp sometimes?
fair
I havent watched tenet, should i?
My favorite movies are probably the princess bride, 10 things I hate about you, fight club, the matrix, and interstellar
itâ€™s not like a big deal to have it but it just takes up space it doesnâ€™t need to
but in some ways it may hurt you to have it especially if youâ€™re applying from far away
but for campus jobs it doesnâ€™t matter
For the work restrictions during breaks do these rules apply to off campus jobs too or just on campus ones?
a roll of paper towels is useful / other small cleaning products
oh right yeah. my brother actually stole mine last week and has lost them since so iâ€™ll grab those at target
They close at 6
I get off school at 2-3
I couldn't work 8 hours if I wanted to 💀
me when i forgot to get them at target (the store was a fucking mess and didnâ€™t have half of what i went to get and also someone stole my cart)
terrible target trip
iâ€™ll steal nail clippers from my dad or smth idk
bc i lost mine and i bought more and they came cheapest in a pack of a bunch
this is so embarrassing why am i packing sm more this year than i did last year 💀
Hurts my bank account
Also hurts the space I don't have for it 😭
I wouldn't have applied to case without Chloe so like props to her :prayge:
Itâ€™s not that bad - everyone gets their own parking space /j
you donâ€™t need them for phys 122 what
When I took phys 122 last fall semester we needed Iclickers
discord buggin out rn wtf
I think they're more expensive at the bookstore. You don't have to get a good one though, they just need to survive this one semester
i got mine at the bookstore and I don't remember it being 70
Wtf
What classes do yâ€™allâ€™s need iclickers for?
Cuz I havenâ€™t seen anything for engr 130 or 145
Engr 130 didnt need when I took it
Just checking I donâ€™t need one for sure lol
Engr 145 also doesnâ€™t do quizzes if I recall correctly
Deadass feels like Iâ€™m smacking my head into a wood board trying to break it. Itâ€™s stupid fun but itâ€™s slowly getting exhausting and painful
It'd only be 7 hours a week max apparently
Which means I'd only be working like 3 days
You can supplement with a second job if you need to
But even a relatively light work schedule can feel like a lot during the semester
aleks is gonna be the death of me for chem
never taken chem either 😭
I probably won't need to
I won't be maxing out but eh
If I work 7 hours a week at 12.12 that's like 1300ish a semester
donâ€™t procrastinate your aleks is the main thing i think
when youâ€™ve suddenly got several weeks worth to do in one night is when it gets really awful
Never ever do Aleks the day itâ€™s due
Cuz holy shit some problems you wonâ€™t be able to understand and you need to figure out a pattern yourself to get the answer right
I think Horst wants me to read the syllabus
I never had horst. Is that the physics teaher
Math
i NEED a skatmebord
from the dead?? I died??
they did say that you usually don't realize it when you die...
145 doesn't need a clicker, weekly homeworks, 3 exams, standard fair mostly, just show up day 1 for syllabus read through
oh yeah I never introduced myself in the introductions chat
Replacement monitor I went into debt for
oh slay it's gone
I already spent $7 at Mitchell's this week
RIP Lil Uzi Vert broâ€¦
Iâ€™m still in shock
Nope
how is everyone taking in the school?
These people gonna annoy me already I'm not even a week in
gc will die within a few weeks
It was never alive
the 27 discord fizzled out but the instagram gc died quickly and thoroughly
idk skill issue ig since the other people on my floor seemed to mostly be friends
Tbh I don't know the difference between suites and everything else
Suites quads I still don't know the difference
Gih doesn't really extend into the other 3 years
9 PM donâ€™t come to ashbury Avenue tmrw
Although I really hope I don't end up in a double again these rooms r uncomfortably small
But they seem to be moving towards it with the new dorms
There is still a decent amount of non-doubles housing but idk how good the lottery will be to y'all
Iâ€™m a little late but
now all of the bedrooms are single occ tho
but not to this degree. people did favor triangle and didnâ€™t really care about the double rooms because they were spacious and had private bathrooms and kitchens
Damn lmao
I am not sorry for the cesspool it is now
RIP WHEEL you only lasted a day
Nope
cedar mag just doesnt have balconies
The night I moved it we hung out on the balconies and it was great :> we subsequently lost that privilege forever
I don't think they ever formally announced why but there were a lot of rumors
I was until I saw the division algorithm in my textbook 🥲 Iâ€™m so bad at that stuff
still missing 3 canvas courses
Apparently the ppl on my floor r going somewhere idk where though
Idk
Oh is it the thing thatâ€™s near all the stores
oh slay
How do we open our door through the portal
Apparently we can but I can't figure out how
Yeah but I can't find the button
https://my.case.edu/My/housing/
under "available tasks" -> "unlock your room door"
Itâ€™s still happening
Is Choolaah open yet
so if you don't go for the clubs you can go for the food
@reddishlightning i heard you guys need another furry for theta chi
Do you need one or not
Okay fair enough y'all
(No hate to furries)
math majors are already halfway there to being a furry
Alex will likely never live in the Eigenspace, unless he is part of whoever lives in this house after we do
There are no signs for the Eigenspace yet
It should be a requirement tho
what do we need that for
ashley probably met you though. i thought id never seen her before when she approached me by name
Idk what that is
Aka at about half an inch of movement itll move from one side to the opposite side of your screen on an average size laptop
Just passed the Athenians table
Thereâ€™s no tkd club here it disbanded a few years ago apparently, so Iâ€™m joining kendo, kung fu, and/or jiudo
I thought this wasnâ€™t a shitpost tho it prob isnâ€™t lmao
i know someone on ems
I feel like torrenting on a federal campus is
Oh it did start damn
How does homework with aleks work in chem 105?
the prof sets a due date and as long as you get it done b4 the due date ur good
dont procrastinate!!
dont in general but super duper dont for aleks
*does it 2 minutes before it's due*
donâ€™t !!
Apparently it's supposed to come with a drink but I forgot to get one
i wish i could too lol
unfortunately she cannot drop out 😔
looking forward to CSDS 132 tho
alan arent you like tweaked out on melatonin rn
Aw man
i didnt go to the show me my classes tour cuz i was hanging out with yall
i donâ€™t have class until 3:20 tmw but i do have 11:30 lab
bc professors donâ€™t care that youâ€™re a freshman and you donâ€™t know your way around
but damn
if they're all on the quad, you can stumble around for 15 minutes and still be on time
Oh dope
uhhhh how mad do yall think my anth 103 professer would be if i had to miss a class bc of nursing bls?
probably not that mad
u can usually miss one or two classes unexcused even
for any class generally
syllabus doesn't say anything about abscences 💀
then they don't care if you miss probably
yippee!!! ill still talk to them about it tho
i still donâ€™t know where crawford 09A is
and i donâ€™t intend to find out
im so tired why am i awake rn
is it near that building with the clock on it
iâ€™ve had a class in that building every semester since spring of my sophomore year
im kind of scared
freshman year is not that hard
For chem 105 do we have to do the syllabus questions at the end of the syllabus or nah
last night of freedom
Iâ€™m neither excited nor upset about classes
Also does anyone have the pdf version of the math 121 book? Iâ€™ve been searching everywhere on â€œillegalâ€websites but I canâ€™t find nothing.
I felt like that last semester. it'll get better (or worse) as you get to understand uni life better lol
last year***
there isnt 125/126 tho
which folder is that under sorry
math
rip
in clarke with 2 fans and its still not enough
windows open in clarke and its still not enough yea
i must be tripping because i dont see it in either
why are all the PSCL textbooks different from the ones i need 💀
oh my days clarke has pumpkin cuz of the rotting incidenet
For textbooks you can't find try using Anna's Archive
Really?
I knew I wasnâ€™t tripping because my roomie just downloaded it from my phone
lol all 5 of my suitemates have gone to sleep already and I'm here munching on a waffle
bold of you to assume iâ€™m asleep
Knew something was gonna go wrong
I forgot to bring my charger
Idk if my phone's gonna last until I go back to my dorm but we'll see
Idk how to get to my next class
Geller doesn't appear on the map
The amount of time it takes me to get to my class is basically the exact amount of time I have till my class starts
Actually got here 2 mins late
A what ate chalk?
Covault eating chalk has me dead
wtf 💀
he like bit it in half last semester and ate half
The entire fucking stuck
i'm dying
Holy fuck
Also if anyone wants to watch me make lemilk at Leutner come to me, I am sitting alone at leutner sorta close to the windows
Have to wake up to math every other day
:sad:
einstein bagels doesnt accept meal swipe right
nope
nah my monday fridays are rly chill but my tues thurs are hell
in one way i did have class but its lab but im not registered for it yet
That moment when you play your violin so hard you have left hand tremors
Schmidt auditorium is inside the building
This class
Is the type of class I dreaded
I can already tell I'm gonna be getting 90% of my knowledge from this class outside of it
I donâ€™t think it has echo360 either
What class is that?
Idk I haven't really seen that many good use cases for AI in classwork
So I have a quiz at the beginning of every math class and a quiz after every cs class
(Reference the article about some college student using a GTX 1070 and AI to decipher an x-rayed scroll or smtg, and the bread classifying ai that ended up being able to classify the types of cancer)
A SOCIOLOGY CLASS WITHOUT SOME 10 PAGE ESSAY
Which class
who do you have? mine seems to be very diff from yours
i have 2 papers and 2 exams (including the final) and nothing else
I was really hoping that by the time I got to college we'd be done with hand written code
Not me having to miss my first MUDE class tmw cuz I have an interview tomorrow
real. so many good apps for everything and colleges always pick the Worst ones
It just never fully loads for me
Handwritten code probably isn't going away for us anytime soon. AFAIK most higher level CS courses aren't going to be language specific and so will use (likely handwritten) pseudocode.
Fair enough but still annoying it's so much harder to pick up on mistakes when I'm handwriting it as opposed to typing
When does the Wade mail room close?
So now my bed is like 2 feet away from the wall in an already small room
And the tubing doesn't stretch long enough to move it in any place that doesn't mean 
A: my bed has to be forced to the middle of the room
B: my desk has to be forced to the middle of the room
Damn the tube is crazy 😭😭
Fr like this accomodation isn't accommodating at all
But nope
But apparently we only get portable ones
I mean ignoring the existential dread of failing math and cs
Nothing unexpected
No idk jack shit
I'm gonna hate this app
Like d2l showed you your grades and all but it didn't show how you compared to the rest of the class
I'm gonna HATE seeing myself compared to the rest of my class
If you did average or better, it makes you feel better that you know that knowledge and if you did worse, it makes you feel worse. Equally it removes the anxiety of not knowing too so
I actually probably want to keep above a 3.0 if I want an internship
Idk what that is
Yeah I dont
I think I'm going to die
The Texas Japanese blood in me keeps me strong against heat
Heat wave this week, should be back to usual fair shortly
Instead it got hotter
this is cleveland were talking about, I wouldn't be suprised if the weather subvetred our evpectation of normal weather right now
Crying I screwed up my scales hard just now lmao for my audition
guardians lost a double header for the 10th time
we've lost 4 in a row
Missed the high notes for my F major and e minor scale cuz I gambled with a 3 octave
not like you wont get put in the first three desks rofl
ive only ever had one class show averages
itâ€™s so fucking hot
I cannot do this anymore
I canâ€™t do this please
Iâ€™m so close to getting up and taking an ice bath or something
I tried
Shit
I turned my fan off
Hot air
i cant sleep bro
its so bad
it dont do shit
my roommate and i both have fans and it still feels like i walked into a sauna
Broski itâ€™s cooler than that outside open the window
Oh idk I'm sorry
If someone sees a blue/cyan iphone that is very likely mine lol
i cant take it
King did you lose it?
sports club dont get funding
Left it on the 2nd floor of our building
I just realized that like they never responded to my email about needing a loan
Like before they waived my medical plan I asked for a loan because I couldn't pay for it and they straight up never responded to the email
Imagine I didn't get the waiver 😭😭
From what I can see as long as I don't get one of the new dorms they released this year for my sophomore year
I think they are trying to put as many people as possible into the new dorms, but I hope for your success Red 🙏
There are still a decent amount of sophomore singles
If I get anything except an A in this sociology class I'm going to be sick like I literally already took sociology 101 that'd be terrible
Guys I canâ€™t do the heat in the dorms anymore
I can't get by pirating the book for this class
There are 600 occupancy spots between the two doubles buildings, 400 single rooms in buildings on the top of the hill, and about 240 singles in the bottom of the hill buildings (if they implemented their two study rooms per suite thing being talked about last year)
Actually terrible
My last class used the same exact book too
enter the front and go down the stairs to the left
its gone now i think
My bad I was microwaving a freshman
And forgot to add water
why is the building a labyrinth inside
i see the example in the top left but what ends mean what
last semester i regularly had 10000 step days
Who needs a gym
ATP just going to my classes is all the exercise I need
Fair enough
Guys is so fucking hot
Its making me tired all the time
cant find it anywhere
has anyone here taken linear algebra and has somersaloâ€™s textbook/a pdf of it? 😭
math307 ^
My roommate got it from Annaâ€™s archive but you still need to pay 35 for the inquisitive
If itâ€™s someone else no idea
i dont
boo
Ugh
I already have to go study math
Which math
Which means that 
- shouldn't struggle too much cause it's the lowest kind of math
-if I do struggle that's incredibly sad
Level doesnâ€™t matter. Feel free to reach out if you need help
Not when it's a class you already took I don't think
I haven't touched math since which makes it a lot harder to remember everything lmao
i took a pretty thorough calc 2 class senior year of high school, got a 5 on the ap exam, and still struggled in calc 2 at case
The difference between precalc in HS and precalc in college is that hs teaches it like it's completely new (because it is) but college seems to teach it like you already know the basics of each subject (which although I probably should, I do not)
yeah college classes are different than high school bc of that idea that theyre building on known material, and also theyre twice as fast for the most part
rip
My last math class was 1st semester junior year
physics math chem
why not do one of the combined phys/math majors (math + physics, or the math concentration within physics)
im thinking of doing that but i want to talk to my premajor advisorabt that cause i dont want to lock myself out of opportunities by doing less lab work
do you miss out on a bunch of labs in the combined phys math stuff
Cause the app only shows me how many total swipes I have
Oh nvm it shows the periods you just have to go through like 4 buttons
wow yeah sophomore labs arent required and junior lab is optional thats more dramatic than i was expecting
I dropped out of the math 120 summer minimester because within one class he said it was stuff we "remembered from highschool" like 6 different times and I knew I wasn't going to be able to handle an already shortened semester like that
I don't want to be that student
That doesn't read any of the "required readings"
Rn it's study for math or read book and personally math is more important 😭
wrong
Yo do gel pens work with carbon copy notebooks
I just realized I donâ€™t have any regular ballpoint pens
Iâ€™m too ocd I donâ€™t want to do the testing for myself
as long as you dont write super lightly and the pen touches the paper then you should be fine
Math and cs are horrifying, political science seems like a decently large time commitment, and sociology and astronomy r ez
i'm not gonna have all my classes till thursday 💀
Where can I find the calc textbook for 121?
I need to do the homework
Omg youâ€™re right wtf lmao
Probably didn't put it back in properly
Or that's just how it is I mean I don't remember
rip your pcie bracket
Nah this PC is getting sold for parts
It's too broken down to sell altogether but the parts r still worth something most likely
Idk 3200 I think
My roommate closed it ;-;
i just donâ€™t close it
the fan in the common area is mine. i don't have one in my window
Iâ€™m also in Clarke so thatâ€™s making things much worse
oh no 😭
I'm in millis schmidt rn and I swear it was cooler outside than in here
@redemptive101 what time do you have MATH 120
As in, just ended or about to begin
Which is horrible
Yeah nope
Yeah no I failed that but oh well I guess lowest grades r dropped
nord 204?
i just had class there
It's an 8 minute quiz and it took me like 6 to even start answering the question properly because for the first 6 mins I was solving it wrong 💀
So bad
can't seem to find it on Google maps
Isnâ€™t it in wade commons
Itâ€™s Denison hall tho so idk
I somehow never saw it
love getting the common cold
was hanging out w my friend and she got me sick
oh fuck
My legs feel like death tho
I didnâ€™t know there was a mixer right after though
Needs more
i might be *slightly* regretting taking math 307 over 201 🥲 this first hw is killing me
She told me you really wanted to join Glee Club but you were just shy
i would be down but i cant even sing man
Asking Adam if someone is weird is like asking a fish if they see the water
omg
yeah but i would feel bad 🥲
but that's fair
so feel free to stop by on Wednesday :)
will def want to go to the concerts tho
Guys for math 125 is the first quiz just like the worksheet she gives
is math 125 just like combinatorics
Although the hw is really straightforward so if you felt like the worksheet was challenging enough then you prob donâ€™t need to do too much of the hw
I feel like for a few of the hw questions I gaslit myself into getting it
No fr I need to look at that tmrw
Iâ€™m getting up at 6 am uh oh
To make sure I didnâ€™t magic an answer into existence
Go to sleep-
More sleep earns clearer head
Already missing classes 😭
My recitation is in 5 mins and I forgot I even had it
It was supposed to be like a group assignment thing so I'm prob just gonna have to do it by myself
if so yeah dont miss those cuz its free points
I straight up forgot I had it cause for some reason
Its not anymore, recitation labs are now 0% of the final grade. We still have to do them though
Syllabus says so, but still have to participate so you can get a good grade in the end
You probably wonâ€™t be able to get an A, idk what the percentage breakdown is betwren all the 0% things
So just try and if you do bad it really shouldnt matter
Do all my cs work
And then study math ig cus I have a quiz every class
A test though
Ours isn't curved
Theres 4 i believe? Idk doesnt say on the syllabus when the tests are sadly
oh
im sorry for the questions just genuinely so curious how he changed ti up
Im not sure tbh, what i heard from people before is that there was just 4 big projects throughout, idk if thats still the case or if its 5 now
its so odd he didnt clarify lmao
I hope, i dont want 4 midterms 😭
keep us updated, i need to knwo lmaoo
Four of them in close formation
Is there an Air Force/ navy base near here?
... do you want to know why? I do
Kill on sight
can someone tutor me in lin alg 😣
holy fuck the airshow people are so annoying
math?
Oh shoot I still need to figure out how to join that
I'm so pissed that the DOD pulled the B's out of the airshow
Is there something classified that they donâ€™t want people seeing up close?
But I'm really pissed
I really want to go to the air show
I forgot about the A-10
Got a ton more on my computer
Yeah thatâ€™s how I would have said it if I wasnâ€™t stupid
holy crap those are sweet
Its such a shit plane tho
Yeah theyâ€™re crazy old at this point and arenâ€™t they literally only used for close-air support?
They were terrible at CAS too, in Iraq and the first Gulf war they killed a few friendly's and it was found to be pretty terrible at penetrating even older soviet tank's armor
hence the massive fucking cannon
These I need to re-edit
For math 125
did you guys have any tests or quizzes yet
No not yet
We havenâ€™t really done anything yet except for doing â€œlab 0â€ which is just installing the thing and then Matlab Onramp, which is like an entire tutorial
2 hours
i took it several semesters ago. it is very easy. i stopped attending class after the first 2 weeks and got a 99% in the class
i took it last semester with shung
Mainly I was just wondering if there was anything already assigned this week
I'm not too worried about the difficulty since I took AP Music Theory in highschool, I just did bad on the test because I have shit aural skills
So either 2x+3 is zero (so x = -3/2) or 2x+1 is zero (so x = -1/2)
anyways Iâ€™m gonna go get pissed on by recycled dinosaur water and then use various oils to remove other oils
it varies wildly from prof to prof whether you need aural skills or not--mine thought ear training was dumb and did like one class on it to get it out of the way, where the only consequences were that the people who were right most often got a bag of chips
you donâ€™t want me giving advice about music theory
i have a class during recital class
Damn
You can't use the app to order there
So idk what they have
I've never actually ordered from anywhere here in person I've only used the app💀
At dunkin there's a swipe line
Guess I'm fucked
Never mind Alan made me drop the class
Bro is anyone here in phys 122 please ;-; I need to suffer with someone for this class
I lowkey know whatâ€™s going on but I want to have someone else to confirm Iâ€™m not pulling a little stupid when solving stuff
Adam you shouldve stayed to listen to stupid questions
~~He left the server??~~ just offline
idk how much help Iâ€™ll be but I am in phys 122
its everything and nothing at the same time
Thereâ€™s a notebook in front of me to your left thatâ€™s like weirdly sticking up partially
Holy shit
they tend to use PBL as a marker for themselves cause its visible from the air and ugly as fuck is what ive heard
I saw them from 5th floor of Clarke really close
My SE 2020 camera is so dog
Goofy ahh picture I tried to take with my birding binoculars
oh they just did the synchronized loops again
its lame as fuck
I didn't get a thing out of it
is it mainly mafu teaching this semester or is it mostly someone else and occasionally him
Damn right they should
Also who wants an 80 minute video about the controversy surrounding element 118
Aka if anyone wants weird long academic journalism video essays on YouTube, go watch Bobbybrocoli videos
wait im so sorry it's not needed anymore :/ maybe some other freshman or next year
Yeah, they can help you with editing. They won't just do it for you though
Like if I bring them a paper I wrote but Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s not answering the prompt or not explaining well or whstever
omg really should i just email her
unless its closed rn then just email to ask for an appt
Wait nvm lmao sorry Sophie wrong person
I havenâ€™t started
Are there any places that take meal swipes still open on Labor Day
Thankfully I live 5 minutes away from the den
I think Plum's still open
Can confirm, plum looks open.
If you wake up really sick what do you do ab classes
Just suck it up?
Email your teachers and don't go
or if its really bad contact the cwru academic office i think
Some profs will require documentation, which means either emailing your advisor and trying to get them to vouch for you, or scheduling an appointment with the clinic.
What if itâ€™s just like a high fever
Do I need documentation for that
Like fever really dizzy will prob pass out if i walk from the quad to my dorm
Apparently you can't take a Cybertruck through a carwash without voiding the warranty 💀 💀
god why would anyone buy that shitty car
Iâ€™m loving how my calc 3 homework thing isnâ€™t accepting the correct answer
Itâ€™s such a stupid car
Help I took an Advil and I think my fever got worse
If your fever is higher than 102/103 then you should call a doctor
Mixing Advil and Tylenol is fine as long as you don't go over the recommended dose
even tho it sucks 102 and below are actually better to let run instead of trying to bring down the fever iirc
pain relief is a factor however
Don't take advil
Lol a year ago like 2 days from now I had 103 fever and UH&CS thought I had meningitis so they sent me to the ER 😭😭
and then they just let me sleep and gave me fluids until the next day when they found out I didnâ€™t have it
@urmama2349 Because you already took an NSAID
I only took 200 mg Advil this morning tho
I might have to freshman forgiveness my math class I'm so cooked 😭
i remember my freshman year in high school i had a crazy neck muscle spasm and got sick at the exact same time so i got stuck looking left unable to touch my chin to chest with a decent fever
you arenâ€™t even allowed to declare your major yet itâ€™s 100% not late
also if its really that bad you can still register for a different course
Well not now it's a potential decision towards mid-end of semester if I just never do well in math
it happened to me
i didnâ€™t really get sick tbh
i mean a couple colds but nothing major
oh my fucking god NSFW (very gruesome summary of Adam's experiences) ||may not is doing some exceedingly heavy lifting||
and worst case if you and math really donâ€™t get along, a major change second semester is very doable. or if you just manage to scrape by in math and do fine in cs thatâ€™s also an option (cs ppl pls confirm)
Iâ€™ve been scraping by in math for a while but CS is still working out
Still not out of the math weeds
If you want to go into AI you have to know your math
That's very true for industry, where most devs will never use advanced math but for Case, I think even for BA in CS you got to get through calc 2?
BS need through calc 3? 

Still my understanding is those classes are difficult (calc 2 especially) but should be manageable with the resources that Case provides if you are struggling
me fr. I just want to make things not do this ai crap
for me bs you need to get through lin alg
idk if it goes much higher
Oh yeah I forgot about linear algebra
I'm CS minor and a bunch of people told me to take linear as a tech elective because it would be useful but I noped out of that one. 

 I don't think it would be all that applicable to doing board level work or basic firmware stuff. Guess it could be helpful for signal processing stuff through
Idk what my problem is honestly like I'm perfectly fine not doing theory or AI in the future cause that was never really my thing anyways
I don't know if it's some form of testing anxiety kicking my ass or not but I do the math just fine the night before, the day of, even minutes before the quizzes but then I turn the quiz over forget one step and I'm completely lost 😭
itâ€™s not that late. tbh i was considering changing my major first semester and i decided not to bc i thought it was too late. itâ€™s not too late.
In highschool as long as I could feasibly finish one problem I could use that as a blue print to finish everything else and it's the same when I'm studying or doing them on my own but that's not really the case here
but if youre struggling with understanding the concepts so that you can solve new problems, vs just memorizing a process and plugging and chugging to solve problems, then i think talking to the prof/a peer tutor would be mroe helpful
Like for our last quiz the first problem was literally *exactly* the same as the one i had finished minutes prior but with different numbers and I then proceeded to forget a simple step and got stuck on the rest of the problem cause I couldn't figure out what I was missing 

And logically the solution is to just do the problems enough that I don't forget the steps cause they're like second nature but it's harder to do that when you're quizzed *every single class* because the pace is just that much faster than I'm used to
I remember people going crazy over apparently having a quiz every week in calc or something but I'd much prefer that to a quiz every *day* 😭
I definitely have been there and I have testing accommodations for 1.5 time which has helped me (my issue was that whenever I heard there was X amount of minutes left I just couldn't think and I literally would shut down) I would recommend talking to OATS about getting accommodations because that helped me
Each quiz is 8 minutes so yes that doesn't particularly help
the faster pace of college classes when youre not used to it is definitely difficult. i did really well (like final grade 98 or smth) in hs calc 2, and got a 5 on the ap, and still felt like i was drowning in when i retook it via math 124 in college
8 minutes is fucking absurd though
it also doesn't help that to me atleast
like unless you're with him in the class as he's explaining this what are you supposed to gain from this 😭
people will get sick
his explanations arent super useful either i get most of my math knowledge from youtube after the fact
i figured out the polynomial inequalities faster from 30 mins of youtube than i did in his class
overall though its very 50/50
As many grievances as I have with it though I don't want to make it seem like its a prof problem
are there other sections fo the class
I looked for spring sem versions but nothing showed up so I'm not sure
i know there's supposed to be another prof because she talked to us during the webinar for this class
But I have no idea when she teaches because she doesn't show up on sis anywhere
thats really frustrating - you want any help with math tho im sure that half of this server would jump for joy to help out (cough cough @reddishlightning)
Have you gone to Dr. Pups office hours?
and straight up doesnt exist next sem
https://i.imgur.com/qa7vCcs.png also does this mean that math in general is just
i think physics went up like. a few days in advance last spring
math stuff went up like a month ahead of time?
my engl 310 teacher told us about how in one of her classes every student except one had almost died (like genuinely almost died - code blue code blue) that year
Yeah every student except one of them
That math quiz
I still didn't fully know what to do for the last half of one of the questions but atleast I got an answer on the paper which is more than I've done before 😭😭
Is chem 111 this boring usually?
Deadass im so asleep
ubuntu has gotten progressively worse over the years
i had to switch to fedora this time after ubuntu 24 broke majestically in under an hour of use
For a new credit score that's about expected. It will go up the longer you have a credit line as long as you keep paying it on time.
Iâ€™m in ENGR 131 and I canâ€™t get past the first q
Iâ€™m highly regretting not just taking Java and fucking up my schedule but oh well
just 'rand' should work
Now donâ€™t report me for â€œcheatingâ€ please
Update: they ran out of spinach
I can take a look at it if you want
Oh, the humanity!
It's not too late to switch
Can someone help me with math
what math
its not that bad cmon
I self studied it so not as a class
For me the main reason Iâ€™m bored in the class is just cause it was already covered in AP Chem
I crammed all of ap chem in like 3 weeks
Oh damn lmao
yeah got a 4 though
3 weeks is crazy short holy shit
Zach Baldwin made that one. He grabbed the clips of Drew Meyer from echo 360. He made the site from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS 

You could probably download the source for his website and modify it though if you wanted to make your own
Wanted to try it out but I'm not paying for it myself n I know they don't take meal swiped
Guys the muffins at case just arenâ€™t it
used to be a generic cafe but it changed last year
i miss the pierogis...
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been in PBL beyond like 2 times during o week
i never entered pbl aside from freshman year
Finished my 2nd recitation thank god my partner was as new to this as I was so I didn't look stupid
Terri got mad when I told her I was sick and couldnâ€™t show up yesterday
the luetner muffins and all the cafe muffins suck
Lowkey, Iâ€™ve been shafted every time I went to fribley cuz it just tastes mid compared to leutner
what no it doesnt
Free your stomach
Nobody is paying attention in this class
It's so boring going through a class I already took
Like not even a year ago
Cause they didn't want to take my credits
what class
oh ig fribley donâ€™t have the gluten free station
Does anyone remember the very last question on the math 125 quiz
This is not a bike you need for campus holy
For going up the hill kinda. Shit gets steep at times.
I got a 60% on a MIDTERM once and got an A in the class
i got a 42% on a midterm once and got an A in the class
calc 223 class?
ouch
tho i think they'll understand as long as your methods are correct?
I think I got like a 30% on a quiz once and still got an A in the class
College functions differently than high school
Yeah this isn't workin 💀
damn 😭
IT IS ABSOLUTELY DIABOLICAL THAT TINK PUTS THE MENS RESTROOM ON THE RIGHT ONE SIDE BUT LEFT PN THE OTHER
Tbf like an 80 was an A in that class last fall
I have a math grade thatâ€™s 50% quizzes 50% final I understand your pain
oh fuck yeah
uh oh I'm afraid to ask what happened
Me deciding if I should drop math and try again next semester or tough it out
If I end up dropping it later I can't replace it with another class for the missing credits
idk if I should take up a half sem wellness course or another breadth
using chatgpt for math practice 😭
if you're locked out now, you can get a temporary card from wade to open the building and use your phone to open your dorm room
is this math120?
don't panic m8 chances are someone will find it and drop it off
this is my final fucking indignation
i haven't had breakfast for the past week
We got there like 1 min before class ended so not rly
Kiss marry kill for the bugs
Kiss the bumblebees (v soft and chonk)
Iâ€™m not marrying bugs
Kill lanternflies (derogatory)
go to the cleveland clinic thereâ€™s so many more here
What happened with Chris Butler? Why is the response this year different?
how would we know we donâ€™t know what old butler was like
close but no touching
Class discord 😭
intro gamedev has a class discord with the prof in it
campus groups just sent me a remidner for an event that happened a week ago
I wanna build one but I suck at building pokemon at general
also i hate dragapults stats so much
Oh man
nope
whoever is playing the fucking dubstep in raymond 4, please turn it down
you're not a DJ and frankly would suck at that job per what i can hear about your music taste -- just keep it down so my peers and i can sleep 🙂
i wouldn't. whoever is blessed to not wake up due to the sounds of goats having sex coming from his room would definitely wake up if i did that
How are you finding this weather
I think today is the coolest day we've had so far
Stop the weather is so confusing
It was raining but I was hot? Like I was sweating
sign of very, very bad weather in the coming days
But then again that maybe because I was trying to get to class in time and my legs were not cooperating
The weather caused that??
Also Iâ€™d like the weather to go back to being hot
Oh oh oh I know this one!!!
fuck
brooo don't dox
Damn
Mainly cuz Iâ€™m a girl
Dunno just easier I guess
Sir, this type of language isnâ€™t allowed here.
listen i've been awake for 24 hours i'm delirious lmao
i can't because my dorm mate is not being a skibidi sigma rizzler
Close enough
i turned 18 like 4 months ago
At this campus, the OLDEST guess I have gotten for my age has been 18
My joints hurt
Even though Iâ€™m 5â€™2
I don't really get playtime because I'm not a big video game enjoyer
nintendo 64 was actual gold tho fr
Unfortunately I do not know what that is😭😭
Oh
i'm getting old sorry
Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™d still get IDed at 25
I do take that as a compliment tho
I've said this many times here before but someone thought I was 12 years old this summer
You've never met me so you can't say that one way or the other
@cygnusxxii is someone who can
ur also freshman wtf
i mean idk maybe i just know adam is 20(?) and am used to seeing him as such but like. doesnt look 12 to me
though iirc theres a picture from 2 years ago where he looks 14
We just look the age weâ€™re supposed to
tbh im fully expecting someone to dox my face and slap it on to here
if it is tho, i fully expect it to be maximum blurriness with shit lighting tho for funnies
meet me at like idk 9:30 at leutner or smtg idk
oh fuck
Too late I saw that
clarisse knows me irl and wants me to curb my caffeine addiction
im gonna outcompete you all with my caffeine addiction later this semester by having heart palpitations from too much damn caffeine
Please don't

You're going to go into pure math and Egyptology
i don't wanna hear a damn ohio joke lmao
i don't feel tired at all
Whatâ€™s really unfortunate is that a math minor is actually looking appealing rn😭😭
I want to do too many things
i think it's cuz people didn't rly know what cwru was like up to this point
At this hour tho?
I went during 5 am
Ran so fast
are you trying to send yourself into an early grave

Oh oops (gacha gambling addiction)
Donâ€™t go to the den right now

i come back and someone moved for me
if you're that person, fuck you
Damn
Sorry to hear that
fuck that person

i had a full monster energy left and that's gone too
fuckers need to learn how to leave someone else's shit alone
Rip
nope
already had one tho
i'm not taking a laptop and monster energy to take a piss 😭
and now i can't fucking focus
because i don't have 2 monster energies
just leave my shit alone
and everyone else's if it isn't yours
is it that hard?
no car
that's awful
i have a fucking dire need to do work rn
Please do not die
I never miss aleks
I had 2 semesters of it and I never want to see it again

What happened?
Someone tried to make popcorn in the common room oven with a pan.
storrs fire alarm just went off bc of lasagna
I didn't know if forks and shit came in the little bag they gave us (it didn't) ended up having to eat with my hands
Cause
Either that or it's only available late night
Cant believe i finally met the last of the lightning trio
FUCK I slept through my alarm
holy shit
Bruh I donâ€™t even remember that wtf
idk maybe
After some time the alarm stops making sounds and just keeps vibrating
How did you sleep thru that tho it was going off for 10 minutes and prior to that I think like 3 of my alarms went off too
Like damn broski
I want ed Craner to lecture
I have a physics notebook I could rip in half and give to you guys cuz itâ€™s just mechanics for the first half
wrong answers only
Idk how else to tell you that work is equal to force times displacement, which can also be translated into mass times acceleration times distance travelled
i remember most of this shit from hs junior year
Fuck no lmao, I didnâ€™t do that for physics in hs
but it's written differently which is fucking with me
idk
I donâ€™t think that integrals required
im so fucking confused
Mafuâ€™s head shape is my Roman Empire
Oh lmfao
5th floor has been clean so far
Someone went from second to eleventh and now theyâ€™re up
AND DIDN'T TELL US HE WAS RUNNING
6th floor is fucking loud
true i went down there for math help and they had a whole yapfest going down
left immediately
But they were up to some crazy shit a few nights ago
Apparently we (fifth floor) were so loud last night that we drove them out
Idk
i think i know some ppl at 5. forgot tho
dude it's litrlly all broken tho
a ton of the fridges and drawers and blinds don't work
like you're not missing out dw
I heard from someone it was supposed to be a prison
I just have the understanding that Clarke is the worst in like every way
But I have yet to actually be inside of it
this is just wrong
Also do you still have a headache?
nope
headache erased after first caffeinated drink
Guys Iâ€™m technologically illiterate, how would I take a document I scanned and files that I downloaded from a computer and combine them into one file
And theyâ€™re towards the end
my neurons hurt
my world is slow
it's too slow
world is wayy too slow
like my phone is +14695144780
WTF
did discord just fucking dox me
Damn
i was about to say "my phone is typing way too slow"
i just got doxed by a fucking app
Damn if it helps I did not see it
yeah I hate how discord does that
I think that's a phone thing and not a discord thing though
wait wtf it auto-updates. it just put my dorm address, last time it was my home address.
I hate that
but still
jake's phone

Is the Wi-Fi RESLLT bad or is it just me
Always bad lol
Bro what happened to you Arnav?
some idiot ruined the physics homework i spent 3 days on
Is it the one due tonight?
i'm pissed
maybe idk
that won't bring back my work
the one that had the most work
oh like on paper?
i legit fell asleep while working
didn't hear them messing with it
i was knocked out cold
really at this point i'm not even pissed
just disappointed
I don't blame you, you'd think people would at least act their age in regards to that
that's what i'm disappointed about
now idk how i'm gonna get it in before 12
Do you want help?
We got 2.5 hours
idk whether i'm triggered or just disappointed
what could drive someone to be this ignorant
What problem(s) were taken?
the pain in the ass one
don't fucking steal it
because then you make poor people suffer for your inadequacy
sorry for the tirade. just needed to get some shit off my chest.
lemme guess 5'4
so if you need any help, lmk
yes it's a quarter after 3 AM and no i do not want to get sleep
i have 3 monster energies in my system and i'm either ready to conquer the world or die trying
i've been told he looks a little dumb
nope
Damn
I actually have no idea why discord said I was typing. I wasn't trying to send anything
no thoughts head empty 13/10
Not a single brain cell behind those eyes.
or person idk lmao
@tazmania40 did you get to work on the investigation?
I just realized the reason I get confused when people ask me if I have Butler is because I have both Butlers
there's another butler in engr130
I wonder how many Butlers there are in the school
Dude this guy at the table next to mine in frib is recounting some dreams he's had and I'm trying so hard not to eavesdrop but they're like actually peak fiction
Idk Chris Butler always just says to call him Chris
FYI the Butler of the PhD variety is much worse at teaching than her counterpart
This wasn't entirely true (at least today) I ordered at like ~11:40 and got it at 12:30
too bad i will be in a lab during that segment
I ain't rn because scicomp HW just finished
can't, doing my chem hw rn
Lame, chemistry <<<<<<< democracy 🦅🦅
Is anyone able to help me with math307 hw I have a question about drawing something
Idk something about all of us eating cats
Apparently somebodyâ€™s eating cats and dogs 🤷â€â™‚ï¸ news to me
Oh yeah I forgot the democrats want a two state solution
SOMEONE GAVE ME MONSTER ENERGIES
IF U STOLE MY PHYSICS HOMEWORK IDC TAKE ALL OF THEM
Bro will you be able to sleep tonight if you drink those?
idk
i feel
one is consumed whenever #counting goes up, would be my guess
this man rly out here speedrunning the heart attack any%
i may or may not have passed out in my room for like 3 hours straight
i went to sleep at 2am and woke up at 6am
no caffeine in my system yet either
Oh no ;-;
Will you still be able to sleep tonight?
cuz she can't even enforce that otherwise
they're at william and mary, studying international relations and economics i think
oh yee
like i dated a 19 year old when i was in 9th grade and she wanted me to be healthier in terms of my caffeine addiction 😭
i remember helping her with her physics homework looooooooool
Your strength in physics seems to go a long way back
i cant even say much i was dating a college freshmen when i was in junior year
I'm gonna be honest I have not dated anyone before so idk
is it bad
at least if you're not an adult yet either to have an age gap of more than 2 years
wtf...
And another day for a leap year probs
now that my frontal cortex is a bit more developed i feel groomed ngl 😭
WTF
brother we are all telling you that is a horrible thing lmao
someone in my school was 13 and dating a 23 year old 😭
not even the worst out of my school
worst ive heard was 11 and 28
in my school
that is a whole generation difference wtf
we are all college students here
we broke af
Are we all just asking for money now
(i want to cause hyperinflation like venezuela)
My friend went to a stock simulation event thing or something and they gave her money they shredded
guess the %age
Idk
holy shit
I wonder what the presidential debate would look like if the US's inflation rate suddenly got to 20000% or something (not that I want to find out)
bruh that presidential debate was fucking wild
they wouldn't be able to run the show
"she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens in prisons"
this is such a sentence that like if it wasn't spoken is straight up just an ai generated transphobic sentence
Wtf
these %ages compound each year btw so it's even worse lmao
DAMN
100k means nothing
holy shit
it's just straight up dead lmao
i am bad at money so i do not understand these things
its about as fixable as my knee problems
moving it left
to fix an inflationary gap
Iâ€™m stupid af
don't ask how i got a 4 on the AP physics 1 late test
i'm slow
I donâ€™t have enough common sense to not die in an accident, but I have enough not to get into trouble with admins lmao
Love how that logic doesnâ€™t even make sense either but it does anyways
Have you ever considered majoring in math
fuck
Hey if someone sees a key card somewhere between culter and the den it is probably mine
Left or right lmao
my photo can't send 😭
Do any of you know of any math or physics professors that need/want some undergrad help?
Iâ€™m 3 rows behind where that photo was taken, 1 seat to the left
fun fact for anyone who either is taking or will take Math 124, even if you opt out of the online textbook you still get access to it
Iâ€™m so rusty, I almost lost a bunch of times
nope I'm taking it next sem
which maybe is a bad idea cuz I'm gonna die with the amount of work
oh fair yeah
Better than doing labs for phys 122 which sucks
Are the labs also 3 hours long?
idk yet but prob more than I am currently
Omg gl o7
I'm at 18 and I can't take it
Only hard ones are math 223 and phys 122
out of curiosity is anyone taking math 121 chem 111 phys 121. isnâ€™t that just a 3 hour strosacker marathon.
Omg the answers to HW 1 are out
Itâ€™s called you donâ€™t lmao
Next semester but I know someone in my eurhythmics class with it this semester
im trying to see if I can get away with the bare minimum 💀
gonna see how long I can last before I actually have the buy the required book for the class 😭
I like how it sounds tho
oh????
omg 💀💀😭
well shit we need them today
so I guess I need it now
Im scared to look at the answer key 😭
oh... sad
It keeps going up
WTF 😭
Idk who is ordering knowing itâ€™ll take 2 hours but those people just make it worse 😭
stuff we did was like:

metronome set between 3-4.5bpm, find out how to clap on the beat after 4 repetitions by subdividing it in our heads

stepping around the room in rhythm with an excerpt being played to internalize it before dictating the rhythm on paper

idk how to describe the canons
damn
funnily enough I eventually found the room by just accidentally running into my instructor
i mean if you really want you can email about getting into it next year, its on a 1 year cycle though so eurhythmics 1 is only in the fall
oh this is a cim pe class?
also this as well, it took them like a week and a half to get my shit in
i want to cause mild chaos
how's it in the apparently chaotic taplin 4
People are just loud sometimes, itâ€™s really not that bad
itâ€™s the reason why bikes got stolen from dorms last year
didn't your RA like take you to a convenience store that doesn't ID people or smtg apparently lmao
Except for when people get on the roof, itâ€™s not that crazy
i'm still not in all my classes
I want unethical but legal, not illegal
no i am in class
Damn
sad
But for Chen 106 I was late with HW so I lost 25 points
holy shit
you have a 0 in a class
Not yet
Can someone help me with 5b and 5c
Do you get B at all itâ€™s killing me
Working on it
But I donâ€™t get how 😞
Still trying to figure out b
It might have something to do with sampling without replacement
Stuff above the line is the original work with names abbreviated
Iâ€™m sticking with only 2, I canâ€™t fit more on the plate
how to dismantle an atomic bomb is absolute bomb tho (pun intended)
We should prove it wrong for funsies
I mean it already partially proved itself, me and the others who used to be active are all gone. Although who knows maybe you all will keep it going
Where did you find those 😭
also i totally forgot I joined the server so early on wh
By explore event calendar do they just mean the regular event calendar cus I don't see anything differentiating explore events from any other kind of event
There are some that donâ€™t have it tho, I went to a visiting speaker during orientation week and they gave me credit as well I think
Oh you might also want to check out the Explore group on CampusGroups as well, I think all freshmen are enrolled in it, I havenâ€™t really looked at the page but I assume they are the ones doing some of the explicit explore events
Hopefully it didn't take too long
Idk 😭
They need to die
I just found out they're invasive yesterday
Theyâ€™re absolutely horrible for agriculture
Lowkey what if I like got one and turned its wings into earrings or something
I mean as long as you kill as many as possible itâ€™s fair game
was quicker than I thought. didn't expect it to give double progress on streaks.
I found out last summer. early summer, when they were still in the nymph phase. then we had a "THEY FLY NOW??" moment
Oh man
Did anyone take the math 125 quiz today
@idkwutmyusernameis2931 sorry for donowalling u lmao
that was funny â„¢ï¸, Im nursing I dont take things personally or assume the worst tbh
fuck
fuck fuck
fuck
idk then
well idk what phys 122 is so
Thereâ€™s an ig account for it now
It go hard
I don't recall which country
my last braincell
anybody still selling a clicker?
I mean someone prob has one here but like highkey youâ€™ve missed quite a few points for chem
Just eBay it tho if Iâ€™m being honest if no one says they doâ€¦
idk what your dorm is but for clarke tower there are rockstars in the vending machines
I don't want to break the rules, but I also don't what else to do if someone pings me and asks
Hmm I haven't calculated my uncertainty for the predicted yet
I just donâ€™t know if I should say â€œyeah, this means that newtons law doesnâ€™t hold, somehowâ€ but this seems like a systematic thing
I guess so?
itâ€™s probably friction and air resistance or something
I think it means that since our calculation of the angle involves balancing the counterweights with both gravity and friction, we can "ignore" friction because we're lumping it in with all downwards force
but that only really means static friction, so kinetic friction and air resistance are still a thing
Things to say if someone asks if you are registered to vote, but you don't want to waste precious minutes of your life:
there's only one person you can vote for, and their last name doesnt start with B
Bro 5th floor Clarke is having a fucking party wtf lmao
he turned 18
no longer a minorrrrr?
Iâ€™m turning 19 in a few days, it legit feels like Iâ€™ve been 18 for a week
ur 1 year off from no longer being an adolescent
Last year was my â€œturning 18 on the 18thâ€
Now I feel old
18, but I didn't do a lot for that one 18 birthday
Arenâ€™t most freshmen 18 though in the fall?
Most are, not all though
has anyone here taken bio 214 w dilulio and gardner
damn
whens your exam
Monday
my body feels like an oven rn
i don't wanna hear a *peep* out of you sir lmao
Rip
bruh uhhc is closed
damn bro feel better
I think they just permanently pulled the episode from the air
bro this scene makes me feel uncomfortable asf
interestingly enough caffeine releases endorphins which can take away pain
would it be that bad if i did this daily
shoulder hurt
i want it to not hurt for track
bro im so sleepy but i dont wanna sleep
i get fever dreams
someone told me 800 per semester
how offended i feel 😤
silly arnav.. we don't go on trips when we're sick! (105 degree fever)
nothing came back
but its been hurt for a year now
got diagnosed with a high grade fever from a viral origin and was told to rest as much as possible
High grade fever=high grade on exams
i feel like i'm playing "intellectual disability simulator" rn
cuz pulling the alarm falsely is a crime
so it wasnt a false alarm they just kinda lied
so idk man
we can use the fact that no one got arrested to deduce some shit
cant you smoke at 18
nope 21
i didnt know that was switched
if i roll a 2 i'm gonna go to class tmr even if i have a fever
fuck
you shouldnt
I went to classes with a 104 fever
It just gets bad at night
please dont chug monsters
Just go to bed at a reasonable hour
jk i'm gonna listen to the premeds sorry
do not go to class if you are sick, or at the very least wear a mask please
plus i almost had a seizure so i'n not gonna risk shit
i am not a premed. i am just a little guy who doesn't want More Illness
Yeah, it'd be pretty great if you didn't die
Seriously tho please take tomorrow to rest
rsv takes away your will to live 😭
Damn that does sound rough
I feel like thatâ€™s like near death level temp
Iâ€™ve never seen someone so unwilling to miss school😭😭
Is it like a cold or something?
i want him to get close to but not touch me
Stop is that why you sat in the front I think last class?
Iâ€™m sorry but heâ€™s lowkey overhyped
i haven't sneezed once in the past week
Yikes thatâ€™s worse
Unfortunately
seems ez tho
Tomorrow's a review day so it shouldn't be terrible if you miss class I think
not close to and not touching me 💔
rip
i gonna miss butler
Doesnâ€™t he teach 122 as well?
FUCK
I don't really fall asleep in his class
fuck i shouldn't have used my AP psych credit
i want to be taught by a psychologist
in our ap psych class we all took an IQ test lol
I think the ones listed as of last Thursday was "Funky Fractions" (yes that was the name of the experiment) where you literally solve fractions as fast as you can, and then the other one was something else, idk what it was exactly, but I think it involved responses to different stuff (ex. hot vs cold water) or something
You have to sign up for experiments unless you're 18 or just don't want to
wtf is the funky fractions one
was it an IQ test or sum wtf
man i shoulda taken psych101
that would be boring to me because i already took AP psych
Yeah, it's boring on most days, and it feels a lot like "cram all this info into your brain"
The funky fractions one isn't taking sign-ups anymore, this is the only one rn we can do
Man AP Psych seemed fun, my school didn't have it because it didn't fit our curriculum or something
I think the researchers would get significantly more than you out of the ones like the hot and cold water one
hot and cold one sounds boring lol
the ones about sensation are hella boring it seems like
I missed the Weezer Voyage to the Blue Planet tour in Columbus: the closest theyll ever get to conducting their space rock opera 😦
I am so sorry
fuck
fucking fuck
fuck's fuck
oh i thought it was today
bad for health
as soon as you said that my heart rate went up to 150 bpm 💀
Yall take it easy on Arnav, he has a caffeine addiction and a fever
i feel happiness
i need cawfee
oh i'm a dumbass-
i haven't drank a single bottle of water since morning
fuck adhd
AAAAAAAAAAA i feel like my hands are balloons
someone else literally said "stop skibiding" to me when i was walking into leutner
if u are sick don't just drink water, make sure to replenish your electrolytes
I turn 20 in early march
Holy shit
you want to ban your suitemate?
damn
@merctai damn bro
FUCK
apparently I am
arenâ€™t you the plaintiff
i got a 160 on my LSAT don't fuck with me
I finished that posc exam with a minute left
i feel very blessed to have chosen 160 instead
Towards the end I just started writing straight nothing to hit the paragraph count
either one
society is progressive just in the wrong direction :ahhh:
This was an AI generation of one of my friends who has a really big chin with the prompt â€œcurly haired male teenager without any facial hair, a huge chin, and wearing jeans and a hoodieâ€ 😭
Really failed on the chin part unfortunately
it's okay arnav we can make you feel included with some regularly scheduled enrichment
what the hell is this fever dream shit
@queen_arcus this is why im scared of sleeping
fever dream
i mean you do have a fever
Fever maxing
what the fuck
Did you know crabs can feel pain?
i feel like my last neuron got sheared
bro for some reason it feels like i fractured my arm
do fevers cause pains
i would know cuz i actually fractured my hand a year ago 💀
it feels painful to touch
feels tensioned if i just keep it normal
pain meds
I turn 22 in 6 months
How does it feel to be surrounded by a bunch of barely 18 YOâ€™s here
I feel old as fuck
but I also don't go anywhere except PBL at this point
I'm either in my apartment, at my fraternity, or in PBL
Not the upperclassmen, the upperclassmen don't deal with us peasants
I'm honestly just too burnt out to do anything anymore
Am I doing laptop stickers wrong lmao
dr croom yaps so much i left the room to go use the restroom, came back and he was on the same slide
Yes. 
It used to be drewok.case.edu because you can assign hostnames to PCs on campus and do silly things with that 
But he knew it meant enough to enough people he moved it to his personal domain so it would continue to exist after he left
It's a .org so probably in the range of $10 to $20 a year. 

And he hosts the website on a machine he actually owns afaik so doesn't pay anything for hosting other than power
oh
It's glorious. Makes me feel like I'm right back in chem 111
Charge your phone wtf
Okay I got this laptop like 3 months ago and I donâ€™t have many stickers
Is it supposed to be just slapped on
i have an idea how to fuck with my dorm mate who won't stop blasting music late at fucking night
spam the shit out of the drew meyer soundboard
the computer
sploon stickers omg
i think i mightve left it at home though
Also goddammit why is hibernate mode not working on my laptop tf
i don't get it either honestly
most of the freshmen are trying to understand what the fuck is going on
This is just gonna go on till he either retires or the freshmen find someone even more worship worthy lmao
oh no
wtf is sidechat
wtf is yikyak
We need answers out of morbid curiosity
Oh dear god
i wasn't thinking of that at all
i don't think any of us were thinking that until you brought it up
do i seem like i have HIV 💀 my immune system is fye trust
because i was talking about the actual virus that i'm sick with rn lmao not an std
We need a quotes channel specifically for shit like that
we do *not* need a quotes channel
Tho at the same time, cataloging every unhinged shit is equally funny
sounds like you have a crush on someone in the discord who you don't want to see your tomfoolery
What in the fuck did I walk back in on
SEX IN THE CITY IS GOOD DON'T FUCKING DENY THAT
i won't
oh hell naw
ok i'm leaving
someone's gonna take that out of context aren't they
I'm sorry wtf
his clicky questions are hard
i am bordering on asleep in his class
Yeah you missed a few today
Ik I'm going to regret it severly in the near future tho
wen day is dark and u feels sad
is chem just a hit or miss class for some people
good at math and shit = physics
bro i wasn't paying attention to shit today
didn't miss anything in chem or phys today tho
no it doesn't
fuck
Thatâ€™s kinda sad
Isn't it where the medical library is?
From the quad, go to the end of binary walkway (towards Euclid) and then cross the street to that same corner
I hate all the traditional Chinese holiday/festival foods
worst of them all
nope
math121 was a shitstorm
I don't think you can be saved
All of these sound like good food wtf
We do have to clean it though so be ready for that
wtf
uhhhhh i dont remember-
I will probably be there though
How bad is it? I thought it's supposed to start in a few minutes
i left 💀 aint no way im getting standing in line for the small possibility of getting half a mooncake
Oh nice, I ain't lining up for that tho
rip i wanted to go but i have lab safety training until 3
You're not missing anything haha
i need my bobaaaaa

if I remember correctly the quizzes are only like 10 or 15 points though so it still kinda sucks
No I just had an exam
But sig figs are annoying as hell so Iâ€™m preparing myself for the worst case
Donâ€™t tell Comedy is coming to the Flats Saturday, Sept 21
though we don't need any assault charges here lul
Damn
its a great experience, personally I like Don't Tell because they're really consistent, allow people under 21 to the venue (even if they say otherwise), and have a mix of local artists and nationally-recognized comics (the organization runs across the country). Theres another group called Secret Society comedy based in cleveland that performs at Mahall's and designated restaurants in Cle, but I've found that they're slightly less organized and the comedians are less diverse.
I haven't been able to go to 4th street hilarities, but because of their size they bring in lots of big headliners consistently (i dont think they enforce their 21+ strictly but its more likely than the smaller shows).

Playhouse square also host major ones (Schulz, Sarah Silverman, Kevin Hart are slated to come this fall/winter).
In coventry, the Grog Shop/B-side hosts an open mic on monday's. However, their place is kinda meh cause there aren't a lot of people there
i'm not paying someone money for them to start cussing out my physics and chem professors with me
Anyone here happen to be in butlerâ€™s class?

originlab makes me want to cry
100: dead ends
me and a group of people spent 6 hours in a room reviewing for our every other week abstract algebra quiz and we got through 2/5 of the material

it shouldn't be this hard
FUCK KCKCKCKCKXKCKCKCKCCKCKCKCKCKCKCKCKCKCKCKCKCK
i shoulda taken AP sem
last semester i ended up fucking up my topic and had to write a >3k word research paper
death shit
Have you been doing your class readings?
damn
if you're extremely behind, read the intro + conclusion pages to each of them and pick however many you need that seem somewhat correlated, and just read those.
ik this because i did not do my readings and it fucked me hard
i find having an outline and basically playing madlibs with a bunch of quotes to be a lot faster when i need to write an essay
Please donâ€™t ruin that song for me 😭
I'm sorry 😭
someone made a YTP of it
omg
I need answers to this so that I can try and slam out 70% of it in one go
nvm i just need to look im a little silly and stupid lmao
my friend got kicked out of her dorm at 2am because of flooding earlier this year 😭
i got into boston college but chose this college because of how close it is to hospitals n shi 💀

Aren't you lucky you chose #8 instead of #1
then theres mine who's entire chemistry department is unable to access their building cuz it had a chemical leak
some are worse

Donâ€™t look behind you
I have said for years someone needs  to compile a "CWRU backrooms" photo album of all the creepy  hallways around campus
Just needs a bit of cropping
I got lost when I took this lmao
Getting lost is fun
I'm maybe kind of cheating because half of these are spaces that no longer exist but here are some of my CWRU backrooms photos from the last few years
I donâ€™t think itâ€™d be cheating
holy shit this is an aesthetic
though the curvy one looks like a fever dream i had 2 days ago 💀 like legit that was the same room
nothing was odder than leaving the airshow with a gigantic crowd but the train station is completely empty except for us. public transportation man.
The computer is under the stairs at the end of the strosacker passage. The useless door is in veale.
Both photos were taken last year though
Well it certainly cant have been named before Karl Marx
bro u need sleep mf
i don't need sleep i am a big boi
I can sleep this late, my first class isnâ€™t until 10
u need sleep
oh shit i can theoretically go to bed at 2 AM 😭
fuck
Nah, itâ€™s a well known fact Karl Marx found it amusing an already existing ideology he happened to believe in had the same name as him
i showed up to math121 2 hours early
Rip
Sorry for your loss
surely you wont die or anything
caffeine tho
seizure tho
imagine if even speaking was the equivalent of taking a MATH223 final
lowk dont wanna get worse
don't disable yourself for a brief high
this is why i dont drink
doing it on a campus would be exceptionally stupid
surely people dont do this
most freshmen don't drink
there's a term in psychology about it i forgot
im fairly sure im the only one in the group that hasnt drank before
either way drinking on a college campus is exceptionally stupid
i rarely go to frat parties unless it's for credit i need because if cops get wind of it, EVERYONE who went to that party immediately goes under investigation
my friends have been at parties that got busted and nothing happened
did they just fucking run 😭
First of all, any advertised fraternity parties are not allowed to serve alcohol. CasePD also exists partially to keep students from getting into legal trouble for underage drinking, you might be required to have a short meeting with student affairs if they actually pick you up but most of the time calls are due to noise complaints and theyâ€™ll just tell people to either quiet down or go home.
that's really fucking weird
"your honor, he a dum dum with a grand total of 2 neurons that couldn't piece together the consequences of drinking underage"
Because they are part of the university and have their own processes, the university doesnâ€™t want their students to get into legal trouble for shit theyâ€™re going to do anyways so they basically just give people a slap on the wrist and let them go
If you want to go to a real party u need to get on a list or get a fake and go out
to where if students act really fucking dumb they won't get penalized **as severely** if it's their 1st or 2nd time
i talked to him recently because i caught a really shitty virus
i didn't even mean for that to happen
so if i understand right (sorry i'm a huge legal nerd), casepd doesn't even let it reach the courts
there's a segmented police department for university students that understand that undergrads are gonna do stupid shit no matter what
shit if medicine doesn't work i should do law lol
Bruh I hate when I daze off in line and accidentally end up staring at someone, but I gotta act all nonchalant so they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m skibidi
some lawyers literally make it more fair in favor of the defendant
hence the hidden rule that you should rarely reply to police confrontation without legal representation
LSAT sucks ass
that defeats the whole purpose of finding someone else who is single lol
but there's some people who would take it seriously and see it such that they had a chance and it got fucked
and they didn't
that's fair; just those people exist
i didn't even sign up lol
oh fs, i know a couple of my friends were hoping to get matched with each other cuz "true love" type shit
don't try to hit it through a dating thingy
idk what theyre doing lmao
My match found me on instagram before my name came out, she only had my initials and she found meâ€¦.. I donâ€™t know if I should be creeped out or not
wtf
if you have a crush, don't fill out MP because if your crush catches wind of your match that might not be him/her, your chances with him/her are shot
you really can't get hurt that way.
then that hurts
because you're locking yourself into potentially breaking someone's heart or some shit
if you want to date someone, just do it naturally imo
doing it through MP is stupid
I mean if they take it so seriously so as to immediately fall in love before meeting me because we matched and being heartbroken if I don't want a relationship, they PROBABLY aren't the right person for me? idk about you
i mean lowkey you shouldnâ€™t be relying 100% on marriage pact as a relationship finder imo
you shouldn't be relying on it at all
I have a long term partner now tho
which is why the whole point of mp is stupid
because it's extremely unlikely that any sane person will reply to their match without knowing them much if at all
because it locks them into something they might not want
cwrucupid is a slightly better idea tho
Whatever happened to just asking people out like a normal person
nothing -- just some idiots complicated it and a few people followed which grew like wildfire
do you do it every year, every semester, or never again?
it closed at like 5 tdy
that was me last year. we will see if it pays off this year
people on sidechat are like actually verbally killing their matches
that's one weird thing about coming from HS senior to college freshman. I still feel sometimes like I only have one year and have to make the most of it.
ive been trying to find my person and they dont even have socials
already followed them on insta and shit or are you just emailing them and waiting
i may email but idk
i hate writing emails
I just don't. have an insta presence
It can go both ways though
she doesn't seem to have one either
To me, no insta either means she touches grass and is chill or has no social life
Shit post memes on stories, and do actual real posts a gew times a year
The best is when both people feel utterly incompetent to ask each other out so they doubt their abilities for like idk, 3 months?
nah cause i was talking to my now bf for like â€¦ 7? months before i told him how i felt
we were calling every day during the summer and bro still didnâ€™t know what was up
i told him he could be my plus one to my sisters wedding and he still didnâ€™t get it
No thatâ€™s literally me lmao, I told mine even after they asked me out for boba one day I was like â€œsweet, Iâ€™m getting food that dayâ€ and missed the fact I had been setup on a date entirely
it was never casual
it isnt a trope its true
not checkers i was supposed to go to bed two hours ago
I woke up an hour ago from a 3 hour nap, Iâ€™m doing my whole physics lab report starting in like 30 minutes
to be fair (as a woman) sometimes weâ€™re confusing on purpose (at least i am)
god my high school situationship wishes
(he was trying to convince me i wasnt aro. he was wrong)
I didnâ€™t try to convince mine so thatâ€™s my plus Iâ€™m guessing?
Yeah that ainâ€™t right
yet i am comedically dense
i broke up with them bc i starting liking the â€œiâ€™m flirting with youâ€ guy and then we didnâ€™t end up dating
Average male nerd trying to date moment
she dropped more hints that she wanted to do stuff but i kept missing it
the breakup was what made it bad
he was going to ask me to homecoming but i said i wasnâ€™t going bc i was still with my ex
Me who broke up with my ex in junior year cuz she managed to tank my mental health into the gutters âœ¨âœ¨
omg twinning cause my ex also did that
except i couldnâ€™t figure out how to break up with them
i ended up breaking up âœ¨over twitter dmsâœ¨
i had another friend group tho so i didnt hate life
Mustâ€™ve been difficult though
It took a full hour
It actually took closer to 2 hours cause my first order was at 10 but I cancelled it cause it took too long and did this one
not terrible for den
*donâ€™t try to do it intentionally, it should only happen naturally
never
It's usually like 10 mins too early Max
bc it was REALLY off last fall (said 12 mins every time and itd take 2+ hours) but they had their shit together by spring
I've never had an order take longer than 30 mins usually they're like 10-20
personally I've gotten really lucky and had a 20 minute den before
i havenâ€™t had one under 45 mins
Idk
Someone just needs to send shitty discord memes
This is the first time itâ€™s happened to this extent here
Even my past orders that were ~10/11 never took this long
I mean itâ€™s general so anything (within reason goes)
Men only want two things
It may not fill the hole in my heart but it can most certainly activate the monkey neurons of cutting shit
Still play?
Also spent no money on collecting them pngs and jpgs
i havent played elden ring since i got here
it makes me sad
Havenâ€™t used my switch once
either way im sorry for you
What's the left side discord server
I FINISHED MY FUCKING PAPER
FUCK ME
I still play HSR tho, in part because I don't have time to plug in my PS5 again
i would cry if we had to do anything
though my paper was more of a reflection rather than an analysis so rip
i have my p5 setup but ive only had time to play like 20 mins of stellar blade every 2 weeks
only gripe is that most of the COD games aren't on the switch yet
ive heard the zombies might suck thoâ˜¹ï¸
after BO3, all new CODs slowly became shit
cold war is overhated imo
cold war is decent
zombies tho â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸
the mobile version is shit
Aaa I still need to finish the first game
cuz i don't have a nerf blaster
Itâ€™s not too bad
i have a medical need for extended time and i didn't get that because i got the email yesterday 💀
at least for the SAT i knew the end time so i might have been able to be okay without accommodations cuz i can pace
dr meyer literally said "ONE MINUTE!" out of fucking nowhere
i left 6 questions blank 💀
For any answer in chem, Iâ€™d say easiest way to get one is to write down the units you need the answer in, and then reverse math to it
i'm actually so upset rn
fuck
my whole chemistry grade is in shambles because of a stupid fucking blunder
i'm actually so fucking upset rn
So I guess not terrible?
I wish I finished tho
i wished i did at least one of those 6 fucking problems
Thatâ€™s a drew meyer exam for you
sigh
Didnâ€™t get to finish mine either
Does anyone know if he curves exams?
rarely any cwru professor curves shit
legit idc anymore
i just want to not feel like a dumbass
Everyone tends to do the worst on their first drew meyer exam from what I gather
meyer writes exams with the goal of the average grade being a C
cwru profs dont curve as such, but its not uncommon for grade boundaries to be adjusted downwards
I heard from someone that meyer does curve, but Iâ€™m not certain
so like last year in chem 106 a 75 was a b
and its misleading to say profs dont curve when people tend to conflate curving and grade adjustment
yeah grade adjustments in all the classes ive seen happen at the end of the semester
I mean it does make sense cuz itâ€™d also make people have a false sense of security knowing thereâ€™s always a curve to fallback on even before a test
Cuz thatâ€™d just result in people chasing the bare minimum they want and not the max to feel true accomplishment at the end
exactly how grades are adjusted (or if they will be) isnt known beforehand (eg my modern phys prof has said grade cutoffs wont be higher than, but might be lower than, 90=A, 80=B, etc)
Also Iholy shit
someone said that at cwru a A >= 93 💀
wtf this is kinda brutal
i mean convievably a prof could do that but i havent encountered it
we dont do plus minus
leutner is ass idk bro
i do miss the smoothies though
but the actual chemistry is hard
Chemistry is more like a puzzle than actual math
Physics is a hybrid of puzzle plus math
AH SHIT I FORGOT TO USE SIG FIGS ON THE CHEM TEST 💀
there was 1 but i forgot it after
cb only does that because it takes a hella long time to score the test and they reuse questions
drew meyer doesn't
There are still more test takers today
OH WAUT THOSE TOMES WERE DISCUSSION SECTIONS I forgor
**HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?! IT'S A BATTLE OF WORDS..."**
"with... without..."
*THERE IS NO PAIN, YOU ARE RECEDING*
I think I was playing it too much so my parents thought it was interfering with my life or something, I can't quite remember lmao
I think it's more like my sister and I literally don't have much to talk about except school and personal interests
And at that time we just didn't really do much else? Like now my sister does sports and stuff but like back then we would literally just do school, maybe some volunteering, and then sit down and play video games
I'm starting to get into the habit of playing HSR for 30 minutes as a break when I get home, but I don't let it go on for more than an hour at most
"I am not afraid to die. Anytime will do. Why should I be afraid to die? There's no reason for it, you gotta go sometime" - Pink Floyd
Guys, I have a feeling, just a hunch though, that arnav likes Pink Floyd
Im surprised then, that no U2 has showed up thus far
Ah okay, I had a feeling
Is it possible to still switch 106 to 105
No unfortunately 9/6 was the last day you can switch
alright fuck 111
this is why i don't take my stethoscope off anymore
in my hospital, because i was the youngest, people used to fuck with me more

It was fully charged like 2 months ago
have you used it since then
Well ig itâ€™s iPhone camera time
THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT HERE AN HOUR AGO
LEAVE
I don't wanna leave tho, my parents might hear me and then yell at me
But also I don't want to kill that thing bc what if it is a brown recluse
Damn is my room infested already
Oh
I swear if that's a recluse tho
I'm not going closer to identify it, but my mom's apparently found a big one already in the basement
Doesnâ€™t seem like a recluse to me
I haven't started the lab report yet
Due Friday, yes?
Due in 22 hours.
I need help
I don't know
Doesn't Anthony have your physics too?
I am afraid of spiders and I have found two within the last hour in my room
Oh no!!
Oh do yall play stardew?? I didn't actually start the cult but threw *is* A cult
Unfortunately I donâ€™t play Stardew Valley
Idk, Iâ€™ve been looking at pictures of slides for the last 15 minutes
If it provides any solace, I did find that recluses only very rarely show up in Northeast Ohio
When the electric field equation on originlab isnâ€™t working correctly for you for the last hour so you do the next best thing: say fuck it and do a linear fit graph
I fucking hate it
the mickey mouse fuck is this
wtf y'all are doing quantum shit rn?

I NEED A FUCKING WEPA
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO PRINT STUFF LIKE DAMN
wepa is a bad system
cwru needs money on top of our 100k tuitions
FUCK WEPA

The printers in PBL never fail
fuck you, WEPA, for making 15 minutes of my life utterly meaningless
Shit man that sucks
i can't even buy anymore energy drinks on my casecash

How yall be looking like walking to career fair

Oh dang
How was the test? I'm taking the makeup tmrw.
Toilet keeps flushing

bro wants 20 page long psets
221 is ez though
shift grades from general curiosity to wanting a fucking letter on a miserable spreadsheet
I would not be motivated to do the hw if it didnâ€™t have a grade attached to it
I do my math hw simply bc itâ€™s 20% of my grade
speaking of homework have you started the modern
they left the room and said "the fuck" out loud
can someone help with how to calculate uncertainty
i'm so lost
"love was a country i couldn't defend" 💔
Iâ€™m not in this class though, so Iâ€™m not entirely sure
***gets fucking flashbanged***
do TAs scan an exam before they regrade
Because what if someone just changes an answer and then asks for a regrade
very stupid idea to do that
To show they were up that late?
We being a little stupid lmao
half past midnight is late? tf
me after that brutal chem exam
the last one was literally half past two but okay
nope
Damn was not expecting his words to the cans tho
"Die Sprite can"
half past 2 isn't bad
how we feeling phys121
never thought i'd be smiling ear to ear because of a physics problem
the last one was the same (almost) exact problem that was on my AP physics 1 exam
I was too sluggish and didnâ€™t finish again lmao
I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s still because I lack sleep, Iâ€™m slowly not wanting to put in effort or I just did not manage my time well
Donâ€™t get burnt out now
sigh
Omg my mom last weekend forced my sister and I to sit down and watch a movie because she said we were worrying too much and will get burnt out
Guess she is right
So maybe I shouldnâ€™t skip the 30 minutes of HSR then
depends on what you find rejuvenating really
also cut out all the drama from your life
like yesterday i received vitriol because my friend was a fucking idiot and threw me (who fell victim to wrong place wrong time)
that type of stuff needs to be removed from your life if you want to be healthy and successful at a hard school like case
I donâ€™t see or talk to my friends very often, so I avoid it by a separate problem unfortunately
Also sorry to hear about that Arnav
If you want me to talk to him again I can
If thatâ€™s part of your routine, it probably wouldnâ€™t hurt to take a short break from studying and work with it
Iâ€™m not a psychologist though, so donâ€™t take my words as gospel
everyone needs their own kyleapist
the chinese really cooked with HSR
But apparently you can't even do it anymore?
Wtf
i just fell into deep sleep on the raymond couch lmao
exam week's hard y'all
Any more exams coming up for you?
nope
took one for every class i have

ã‚½ãƒ¯ãƒ¬ by æ˜Ÿè¡—å½—æ˜Ÿ is what Iâ€™ve ended up being addicted to for the past few days so
Sorry, but I ainâ€™t coming close if he wants to do that to me
Also Iâ€™m like 20 minutes away
@bnkoeppen do you think thisâ€™ll work as a protective layer between my keyboard and screen
yeah probably, would recommend getting an actual microfiber tho
spotify apparently
FUCK
i can't see jack without my glasses
thought you quit caffeine after you got sick
Bottle of death
it will make you worse
We really need to give an intervention
a 2nd one quick fix
i have a stash in my room tho
will only last a month
ARNAV NO LONGER HAS CAFFEIEN LMAO
FUCK
bro i still have my stash
will only last me until november tho
WAIT FUCK I CAN'T BUY IT
i forgot
fuck you chase
You may be able to hook your card up to a mobile wallet
wait i can't fucking do that because i need to scan the card first
0mg caffeine will make me cry
either way it's gonna take 2 weeks to get my card ready
it sucks seeing 1K of your hard earned money in your account and being able to use none of it
oh dear
you shouldnt hit the limit daily
Iâ€™m concerned this wasnâ€™t clear to begin with
i hate the NCAA
L-taurine is banned? wtf
my daily potion from dunkin might not be enough anymore
the only problem is caffiene which you would need to do like 500mg to hit the threshold
the drug test popping you for too much caffeine
the fuck
we just don't do parties
even if we wanted to tho the GLO rules around alcohol are really strict and weird to work with
odds of being peer pressused into drinking in the house are 0 and instead people will show me silly videos from the internet
it was boring quickly
just a bunch of smokers and shit
i just went back to my dorm, watched whiplash, and fell asleep
i think i'm gonna watch 5 feet apart and fall asleep ngl
FUCK
@leowhygamma movie man find a way to pirate this shit for me
i promise to not have caffeine for a week if u can find it online
L bozo didn't take the chance
I HATE NETFLIX
NOTHING
bunny girl senpai (i swear this isn't bdsm)
Rip
i wanna watch something that won't make my dormmates beat my ass
baby brain arnav needs stimulant anyways
or demon slayer like an average fucking weeb
Donâ€™t fall asleep to frieren though
jjk ended today
Better or worse than mha?
jjk started out nice, dragged out way too long, had some okay beats, and then fucking fell off
gege had to rush ending tho
oh yeah i forgot i bongclouded as soon as i got unbanned HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
do you not want me to sleep
doesnt have to be rn
i need people on campus to discuss part 2 with
its picking back up lately
Iâ€™d have to reread the whole damn series to remember lol
I still need more people to talk about rascal does not dream tho
havent watched
i need to watch more than bits and pieces of it
remember one of my best friends crying about it in our room tho
Involved in the package is: waifus (are you surprised at all), very mild male degeneracy, psychological thought experiment, time travel, and death
I swear im not weird *puts up title card*
censored, just in case people don't want to see that so
I would rather die than wear that in front of everyone
are all of connamachers CS classes free-response for exams?
4 exam weeks
@katsukurry_32009 u scared me wtf
Lol sorry, it was unintentional
or close
Iâ€™m kinda close but I need to cross Euclid
y'all i have a headache lol
physics finally covered shit that i don't know
Oh the humanity!
tmr we find out how we did on our chem tests
i'm really anxious
no need for a numerical score
i feel sick y'all
I thought he doesn't curve?
idk
doesn't help that i still have an AIQS class
that we're actually doing shit in
chem exam score isn't out yet for me
i don't want it
but not into med school
i've dreamt of becoming a doctor since i was 5 years old
despite popular belief one bad exam doesnt mean its joever
i feel like my thoughts are jumping from "you're fucked" -> "AIQS in a few minutes" -> "how can you be so stupid? you already learned this" -> "i thought you were gifted. guess not."
that's a legit screenshot of what ran through my head a few min ago ^
the rational part of my brain knows that it will but there's just one area that has an extremely sick feeling that i ruined everything
its never joever this early
i can still get into med school with this blunder on my transcript?
Itâ€™s one exam, plus meyer also has the final exam replacement thing, plus aleks
are you telling me that every single person who has ever gotten into med school never failed a single first semester of college chemistry midterm exam
you went from being babied in high school to being a full grown adult in college
good thing i have sleepy sleepy drugs (melatonin pills) because i know i'm gonna have a lot of trouble sleeping tonight
*22 hours remain.*
Most people have taken an L on an exam at least once or twice
It won't ruin your gpa or destroy your life, the end of semester grade is what goes on the transcript
sorry quoting random shit is my coping mechanism
But yeah a lot of classes will also have various things that can help cushion bad grades. Eg. Dropped quiz or exam policy, grade curving or rounding, test corrections
so if its truly joever by finals you can just drop
Doesnâ€™t Meyer have exam replacement policy for chem 111?
esp if they blunder on every exam
rip
you ate the exam?
Use #not-english if you want to talk in another language
segregating the non english speakers to their own channel? so much for the tolerant left
BRO I AM ACTUALLY COOKED WTF
me when one of my groupmates doesn't show up and all of us suffer a grade dock
Which class is this for?
brodie u can't vote for ur own petition
Prove that I canâ€™t
i just took a melatonin pill but i forgot that i have dinner
youâ€™re supposed to take melatonin a few hours before sleep anyway
oh
this one is quick release apparently
i also have assignments due that i forgot to do 💀
doesn't unbind it
Too late
honestly i don't even have any more assignments lol i just need an excuse for caffeine
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME HAHAHAHAHAH
I could if I wanted
you couldn't
wait fuck i forgot my card got deactivated
nvm i feel bad i had back to campus so u dont feel confused
i don't want the melatonin to kick in while i'm eating lol
i showered n shit already
cuz i know i'll feel sleepy any minute
i already feel like what people describe as drunk
but i need my caffeine
Man pinged the wrong Kyle
Drew Meyer without beard
Is this from the office hours???
this guy isnt ok at all
cuz
Omg
"he's such a girl dad; he's so baby girl" ~someone i once overheard in KSL basement on the phone
As you can see here, I donâ€™t
Ew wtf
I donâ€™t get why
Need I explain?
@gnp4736251 clearly doesnâ€™t take chem 105 or 111
Are you serious?
Man knows nothing outside of psyche
Please never say that again
This man has gone too far
that makes it even worse
Anytime someone says deer itâ€™s this shit
someone animeify him
dont feel like being shamed
arnav you cant be both daddy and babygirl at the same time
What in the fuck
please never utter this sentence again
Flame the ones who shame you for it lmao
so i wont be shamed
What the fuck
I think any semblance of sanity has died lmao
OH THE HUMANITY
someone force this guy to sleep or
smth
This is worse than the poll I put out
Hm so you canâ€™t be talking
My roommate hates him
But I dont I just dislike him based off his emails
(Just like to point out that arnavâ€™s name is much worse now)
I wonâ€™t argue with that
oh dear
the name got worse
eh he's seen worse methinks
Wtf happened to your name 💀
oh dear it got even worse
Is this better or worse people?
oh dear
thats just awful
id feel so bad
okay can someone tell me what's wrong with this picture
someone said my pfp was shit so i changed it back
probably the most entertaining thing to happen in the class by far
im already ashamed enough
I remember I accidentally blasted trumpet(?) during a study hall at almost full volume one year
that might be a bit worse actually i dont feel as bad anymore
wrong emoji
wtf
I think this because one time before the test these guys behind me were complimenting Drew Meyer somehow (idk the exact wording) to ask what was on the test and he gave them a side eye
kinky side eye
Even though you deleted the messages my retinas have been burned with that
i cant forget those
why does this still exist
He refuses to let the bit die
Last time it was the â€œwrong emojiâ€ you sent it twice before finally sending the â€œcorrectâ€ one
this one is sad holy
I realized I havenâ€™t met my pre-major advisor at all so I stopped by his office hours
But heâ€™s not at the office
this reminds me i havent done it since o week
Yeah but my original advisor didnâ€™t show up 💀
So I got a new one but havenâ€™t checked in with him at all
i'm feeling "it is what it is"
@katsukurry_32009 i shoulda said "KILL" when he was doing pigs 😭
missed opportunity
Rip
I also missed the chemistry discussion section too 💀
Idk, some people I guess
caffeine withdrawal starting to hit
Not yet it ainâ€™t
Just please don't consume too much caffeine
i cant even if i wanted to
Would you want to given no NCAA?
not really
i just need enough to function with my bad sleep schedule
drew meyer doesn't care
i didn't say anything nsfw wtf
i just said drew meyer doesn't care
drew meyer doesn't care about that either
Random drawing for idk how many times
someone make this an emoji
i feel like it will be useful
I donâ€™t have nitro
I just haven't activated mine yet
Wtf
(Me emailing my Chinese teacher with probably horrendous writing while saying that I'm doing Duolingo to keep up my skills but my streak is also dead fr)
The offer ended July 2ndâ€¦
it fit what my audiologist at the hospital gave me
i tried it again
and it's saying i'm fully deaf in my left ear (yeah no shit) and have moderate hearing loss in my right
either my hearing is going bye bye from blasting pink floyd max volume or somebody fucked with my source code
I just lost my dooooh
SHE WASN'T THE PRESIDENT SHE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THIS STUFF
really it just boiled down to that
it wasn't my fucking fault
i didn't get my accommodations
and it is supposed to be 5 days in advance
he says that he has nothing to do with that
i dont feel okay rn
â€œWe have to earn peopleâ€™s trust backâ€ THEN CHANGE YOUR FUCKING POLICY
This should work too
â€œwe canâ€™t blame immigrantsâ€ walz your progressive is showing. tone it down or the centrists wonâ€™t vote harris.
OH NO
HOLY SHIT
vance is doing the work to course-correct trump when trump doesnâ€™t care at all
you're the one to talk holy shit
I wasnâ€™t talking to you either
I donâ€™t believe anyone can talk to the candidates during the break
guy completely ignoring that jan 6 happened
â€œtrump said to protest peacefully and then he left the white houseâ€
walz: â€œthatâ€™s a damning non answerâ€
> vance doesnâ€™t answer the question
oh dear
phones are so important wtf
no shit
fuck me sideways? a device that connects you is important
So unless I went to things I didn't know where explore events
i feel like this isn't applicable to half of the students in this room
just a feeling
i would also guess that they want 6 by the end of the semester, and 2 by next week, and just had a typo in that email, based on how it was for us
You need 2 by October 7th, another 2 by November 18th, and the last 2 by February 24th
i need one more then
sometimes you just need to vibe.
wtf
oh fuck
damn
If you guys are looking for more explore credit next Friday from 12:30-2 is the Choice Fair as well
Ngl, donâ€™t use the app
You cant check on the app
i wish i could worry about explore credits :(
now i cant get free tickets to playhouse square
AH FUCK
i missed my last explore event
Dw, you still have time
Donâ€™t brush it aside though
Ignore ping im stupid
Shit i need 4 more
I hate misery
I would for you for the events I'm going to but it would not work at all
Just need 1 more
i need several
i wish i could just make several clones of myself
the last credit is "6 total events"
i could have had two alr but me and my friend couldnt find the event
Aw man
so I need 2 more
Just check into the choice fair and leave
canâ€™t we still get them
through upb lottery but not through explore anymore 😭
like cg wont let you?
yeah, it wont let me lol
damn
cg makes me cry
Idk
*looks at air vents of laptop*
**realized part of it is slightly broken on the gpu side**
turn off your computer and take that part out. you wanna remove the broken bit of the vent before it falls into the fans and becomes more of a problem
Yeah itâ€™s not broken off anything
holy fuck!!!
I haven't begun looking yet tbh
Studying Banger 
https://open.spotify.com/episode/0s2kLSyRvs7mHr0prr8xU6?si=4cab3ac845f346ec
itâ€™s like not that hard
can't wait to tell them they're the reason we broke up lmao
its like playing russian roulette tho because tism
I either crash or am at peak condition for 5 hours
I feel like its autism with less of the social awkwardness drawbacks
i feel like ADHD + gifted = autism + above average IQ
I also feel like case has a significantly higher percentage of neurodivergent people than the average college
can i infodump on someone
i learned so much cool shit today
Little fellas are trying to get creative with hiding
whoever the fuck put my nebulizer under the sink please go back to pre K and learn to read
the physics lab makes me want to swallow plastics like a turtle
It didnâ€™t seem that bad tbh
you could maybe make that argument bc error prop was still new first sem but overall the 122 labs were worse for me
I havenâ€™t actually seen any live lanternflies lately. theyâ€™re all already dead. good job, everybody.
well no what I mean is I keep seeing dead ones
They have hidden away
**mainly cuz our tools didnâ€™t like borderline break during this lab**
lemme find the pdf
this should have what you need but lmk if you want more details/explanation
now that theres a hold on my account
i realize i don't remember how to schedule meetings with  my advisors
idk if i have to email my pre major advisor or if there's some other way
what doesnt that make us... some sort of CWRU 2028?
would anyone be interested in going to purdue for halloweekend... rn we have 4 people but the more people go, the car rental gets cheaper
dont you have to be 21 to rent a car
Also the existence of the phrase â€œan apple a day keeps the doctor awayâ€ implies the existence of a fruit with anti-apple apple properties that brings the doctor to you everyday
oh i was talking about this yesterday except i just assumed it was negative apples
Dear TA please don't mark this as late for TurnItIn uploading it 1 minute pass the due date :D
Just so you know I'm a bit sickly rn tho, so if you hear someone coughing their lungs out every now and then that might be me
oh god its already 1230
~~don't remind me~~
don't military time me
well I'm gonna get back to grading 145 exams
for what class 💀
they are a ta for that class
damn
I am so sorry, and thank you for the work you do (although I'm not in that class yet)
I've been a TA (albeit for a different class) for the last year
"Many quotes are attributed to famous figures such as Albert Einstein which they never actually said" - Albert Einstein
"what the fuck i never said that, that was Abraham Lincoln" - Albert Einstein
"L plus ratio plus um actually, you lost" - Robert Hooke
"KILL" - butler
Whether I go depends on how Iâ€™m feeling tho (still sick)
If I canâ€™t go dw about me
Near the back on the left hand side when looking towards the stage
I maybe see you? Can't tell tho
Literally cant tell who youâ€™re trying to dox rn
@leowhygamma hehehehehe u can't stop meee
Also some people have some crazy methods of killing lanternflies the carcasses of them are crazy
A couple of hours ago at the crosswalk a lanternfly landed on someone or something like that and it got absolutely decimated
I saw one that looked like it got cut in half
Like someone perfectly cut the wings and left the rest of the body intact before they smashed just the body
Thatâ€™d be difficult I feel
Do you know when the caramel that is always sold out is availableâ€¦ everything I go I canâ€™t get it
Me when I can't find my explore event so I just give up
also is there a way to bypass duo without a phone?
ugh iâ€™m so old
happy idk what number revolutions around the medium size star known as the "Sun" since leaving a biological incubator
unfortunately 😭
damn
how does it feel knowing some people were 17 just a few months ago
damn you are old lmao
drink the pain of being old away /j (don't do that lmao)
rip
What happened to your phone, if I may ask?
now I can't access canvas or like anything at all
this is why duo sucks
I broke google sheets
only one respoded though
falling down stairs also sucks
jokes aside he better than like mathlab or chatgpt for any problem so until he graduates take any math class
oh no
i had some spare money in my apple cash
i don't want celsius
fhuckin hell my brain won't let me sleep
i'm trying to sleep
im almost done with mine for the upcoming week (aka the one due on like 10/10)
FUCKING
guess i can't have dinner(???)
Got any late night swipes left perchance?
MY PHONE IS FIXED
oh dear
He couldnâ€™t even identify him
ngl i dont know who that is either
You are the only person here who doesnâ€™t
Thatâ€™s how you know heâ€™s lost it
Iâ€™ll let you know how he is in the morning if he doesnâ€™t
will he even sleep with all that caffeine
Idk
bro this the white house 💀 the fuck was I on
driving home at 10 PM is a pain so I needed that 400mg of caffeine
he may have said mitchells in the message idk tho
i feel like this is how you create a nuclear thought pattern
Iâ€™m a little stupid lmao
Does anyone have a car on campus I need to take a bird to a vet clinic
tho arnav is an outlier
But we will be 40 minutes away
@mistyphie Do you think they would be able to do that?
Whoops theyâ€™re closed now
Forgot they close earlier today
Just gonna head back then
y'all wtf i can't sleep
the fuck
It's not that I don't want to sleep, I literally can't
I hope you were able to get some rest
i legit slept for an hour without my consent
we died
Work study didn't work maybe they'll let me be a custodian
Feel free to pass by normally tho
No you wonâ€™t lmao
KILL THE A'S
@gnp4736251 I need to give you back your bandages and the other stuff you gave me
@bobbylikebob KILL
But Iâ€™m not asleep
Both of you should just go to sleep
sleep forever 😪😪
I slept for 25 hours on Saturday
Well with like slight wake ups every now and then but still
why didn't you come to the seminar
I was tired
KILL
And also couldnâ€™t wake up
don't you come on Sundays thi
tho
KILL THE Ws
oh...
Cuz none of us cares
does anyone die in it
KILL
Yeah ever since the first test I haven't gotten SHIT out of mayer's lectures
I'm so cooked for the next exam
idt it would be happy if someone died
This class is boring
None of us want to take chem
cuz he is hot
chem study session when
I'm so screwed idk any solubility
Idk any of this shit
It was last year
Someday iâ€™ll actually learn chem so i dont fail the next exam
idk bro
all of you were wrong
this is where the unaccounted 200k dollars went
I wish PokÃ©mon go had an unaligned team
crap i still gotta do a zamazenta raid
he got a dunkin gift card for everyone in the class
Yes 😔 I think you sat behind me on Friday or something, but I can't remember
oh wait really, idt I know what you look like yet I'm sorry 😭
oh
I just don't like chemistry 😔
I feel so left out rn 😭
in other news apparently hurricane milton aimed at florida is gonna be a cat 5. wtf is this hurricane season. weâ€™ll be lucky if one doesnâ€™t spawn over lake erie and nuke us by the end of the year.
apparently not?
I already left
Last lab Dr. Java just straight up broke so my lab partner and I just submitted the lab and called it a day
dr java is a pain 😭
oh no why :((
I still haven't taken the time to figure out how Visual Studio works so I'm still using it for my projects tho (I still haven't completed the first 💀)
I downloaded it because that's what my lab partner got recommended, I just can't figure out how to use it yet
VS code is a bit easier to work with for cs132 purposes
Idk what it was he said
So that is probably really off
Normally 2 days off before exams but for some reason its 1 before and 1 in the middle of exams
This can work
I have Meyer at 2:15 though
oh the  class starts at 2:15
but idk if connamacher will
oh frib
I stand by the fact fribley is worse than leutner
leutner pizza is inedible and youre sayign fribley is worse??
yeah i didnt eat dining hall pizza last year when leutner was home base lol
I mean Iâ€™m effectively vegetarian so leutner pizza is sometimes my only good option. kinda sucks.
Most of us here arenâ€™t
i admire you leo because you're not afraid to be boldly and blatantly wrong â¤ï¸
it doesnâ€™t even matter to me because I havenâ€™t been to fribley since discover week.
oh...
itâ€™s literally never the most convenient option. like why would I go there. when.
and thursday I have no class until 4:30
primarily so that I never have to get dinner at leutner
also i just realized i forgot to scheudle my subway order today so now im gonna have to wait till 2 😭
I DONT WANT TO EAT THE CHICKEN HERE
my only explanation is that the order didnâ€™t even go through for most of that time
It can get bad
They just dont update the time on the app
i mean last year the non dunkin tink places were on the app so i see no reason that they wonâ€™t be this year
Sounds about right for a half hour, it just gets worse as the night goes on
Worst comes to worst you have free lunch on the Dunkin gift card
Iâ€™ve not paid attention in 122 cuz the content for the most part is chill
wtf
i got my 4th gift card earlier today 💀
I got 2 cuz someone just handed me theirs
Or if you sharpen one side a rly shit knife
I swear to god, if meyer doesnâ€™t give chem 105 dunkin im rioting
C- Crying
W- While
R- Rapidly
U- Under stress
okay wtf apparently milton is category 5 already
itâ€™s been a matter of hours since it was cat 3
Iâ€™ll say it again: if by the end of the year a hurricane doesnâ€™t spawn in lake erie and nuke us, Iâ€™ll be surprised.
Me reading paradise lost
Paradise truly is lost 😞
I keep forgetting I can't look at these tink tables
I can confirm someone here does
We both did the math
Even in college teachers are teachers still
Guys we can only use the card during this month to buy donuts from dunkin cuz we canâ€™t in November
Bro Lagrange is gonna cook me so finely that Gordon Ramsay will be disappointed
Lagrange is terrible
Bruh Aleks is now just pulling out numbers out of their ass without any explanation
Lagrange multiplier werent even that bad
I'm crying
(Iâ€™m gonna be bludgeoned to death for saying that lmao)
I tried to drag him but he insisted on going to his class instead
Just dont
Oh gl o7
I exist to make people want to claw their eyes out
Imma get that framework laptop now with your money
couldn't do wailord so i did gyrados instead
oh...
Can I send an awful regirock image
didn't have quagmire so i did wooper instead
i don't have pooper 💔
He mad ):
That just ainâ€™t right
Iâ€™m trying to cut the springs on my GameCube controller
Wire cutters and small Phillips head thinkbox 3rd floor has you covered. 

I don't think they have triwing though
Damn ok
Phys 121 peeps, how hard is the homework?
Uh oh
Of the hw due today or the one due next week?
If you do mean the one due today tho I think I figured it out, I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s right
@casasdefender I can walk you through how I solved it if you want
But it's not too bad
So for example we have a velocity vector in the x-y plane
So the velocity vector as a whole has two parts in the plane: the velocity part on x and the one on y
@katsukurry_32009 wanna study with us
Study what?
the life of a humanities major is no longer coloring books and vibes
Oh no ;-;
cramming(eh)  for a test on thursday
and writing an essay due friday
wanna study
wanna study with us
small study group
we need people
FUCK
i currently have study group
Ah I'm at home lol sorry
we arent rlly studying anything tho just working on our own stuff
you do not wanna miss this
you're studying with dumbos
you wanna be studying with the geniuses
@casasdefender get off discord you fuck
i'm so lost
maybe solubility rules? idk
You should probably still know it tho
it was definitely on the test, idk about the quiz though
what the fuck
I keep missing it ;-;
woah, is that because of the massive solar flare that happened awhile ago?
Ohh gotcha, i was thinking about the crazy one that happened last year that you could see in like alabama
@brokenbladeofmystery Is the northern lights able to be seen again tonight?
it was supposed to be visible this weekend. but we couldn't see it until last night.
the synonym of smash or pass is just hit or miss
Hit or miss implies an attempt for both actions
pass and miss are also synonyms then right?
You pass if you think youâ€™ll miss
Not necessarily, passing is skipping or forfeiting in this context. While missing is trying and failing. Important distinction
But if you think youâ€™re likely to miss you should pass
But they arenâ€™t the same
Not necessarily. What if hitting the target wins you a million dollars? You don't lose anything if you miss, but you lose on opportunity if you pass :)
But if you decide to swing and miss thatâ€™s different
You intended to hit and destroy a city but you missed
But passing and hitting are still different
What if you miss you lose all your teeth
Inevitably in a cwru discord, all serious questions inevitably lead to insane hypotheticals
I'm buying some fucking airpods
Arnav needs his sleepy sleepy time
I hate my friends lmao
oh...
I am studying diligently
Damn not you also trying to doxx me
I canâ€™t believe you just left that out for everyone to see lmao
I havenâ€™t been doxxed yet
And didnâ€™t choose smtg lewd
end user license agreement mention
i dont play genshin but i like kaeya
That's a lot wtf
Cuz I like anime
oh...
Damn
no you don't
I donâ€™t try in this class either
find the force of my body as it hits the ground
I can help you with chem if you ever need
find the force of your body as it hits the ground after falling for time t with initial velocity of -100 m/s
Assume thereâ€™s an external force called my hand grabbing Alanâ€™s head to throw it down
mg + F, but only if you donâ€™t let go
but how much work does it take?
sorry, how much work does your hand apply to alanâ€™s head
im struggling so hard
Tho not today cuz I need to slam out the report thatâ€™s due tmw
Maybe Friday afternoon or some time on the weekend assuming I donâ€™t sleep for like 18 hours

CS majors what does this code make you feel
Oh no
scared
Iâ€™ve actually coded a vigenere cipher and Caesar cipher before tho so I actually kinda know that code doesnâ€™t work
and fucking miserable for anything else
Omg not the ciphers
chatgpt is like a wand that can cast all the most useless spells in harry potter with 95% accuracy but fails when it needs to cast anything without a wide use case
except when it messes up you canâ€™t tell the difference until after you get screwed over by the failure
omg codebullet mentioned
it really doesnâ€™t take much to understand it but it very much helps to know what it is going INTO the rising of chatgpt
Why do you need nanodiamonds?
I saw "like" and "copilot" and got worried
but seriously once you see a guy goof around with code stolen from the internet for five minutes and produce a thing that crappy beats a video game you can never take â€œai is the future of humanityâ€ seriously ever again
I like pretty much any ML model thatâ€™s used for an actual research purposes and isnâ€™t just an LLM slapped into an existing website or product
I agree, I think AI is generally going to be very good and useful but unfortunately right now it's just a shitty tech trend
a week or so ago someone said something like â€œ99% of ai is uselessâ€ and someone pushed back on it because not all ai is LLM, and I was like â€œwell yes, but unfortunately these days 99% of ai use is just useless LLMsâ€
but like. then I see a study over the summer of how researchers used ML to test if they could predict which elephant in a herd would respond to a given call. thus proving that elephants use verbal names for each other.
Yo, let me put yâ€™all on real quick about Drew Meyer, the rizz god of chemistry at CWRU. This manâ€™s got more rizz than Baby Gronk pulling Livvy Dunne, no cap. Like frfr, his chem lectures hit harder than the Grimace Shake challenge, and Iâ€™m not even capping. If you ever thought chemistry was â€œOnly in Ohioâ€ levels of pain, just wait till Drew walks in with that Fanum tax energy, breaking down molecular bonds like itâ€™s light work.

Imagine walking into class feeling sus, like an impostor about to get ejected, but then Drew hits you with that â€œLevel 3 Gyattâ€ of energy, making enthalpy sound like the next Skibidi Toilet banger on TikTok. And the memes? Bro drops the most fire â€œAmong Usâ€ references mid-lecture like, â€œIf oxygenâ€™s sus, then why does it bond with everything?â€ 💀💀💀.

I swear, Drew has that becoming uncanny vibe when heâ€™s explaining thermodynamics. One second, youâ€™re chilling, and the next, your brain hits you with that Roblox Chicken Nugget Gegagedigedagedago overload. Itâ€™s like getting hit with a â€œFire in the Holeâ€ lobotomy, but instead of losing brain cells, youâ€™re leveling up like you just unlocked the Level 2 Gyatt.

And oh my god, letâ€™s talk about his office hoursâ€”this manâ€™s got more patience than Skibidi Toilet waiting to drop the next episode. You pull up with questions on stoichiometry, and Drewâ€™s like, â€œNah, let me break it down for you with that rizz,â€ and suddenly, boom, youâ€™re out here solving problems like you just dodged an â€œOnly in Ohioâ€ meme compilation.

So yeah, Drew Meyer? Certified legend, fanum tax paid in full.
i won't caffeine at all
emma needs their calcium 🙏
@leowhygamma tried to recommend me MENSA testing center headphones lol
somehow I passed
one because i'm a dumbo and two because i constantly had to feel that sting
We will be able to see it

tfw win11 reboots your system right as you finish your origin data analysis AND LOSE ALL OF IT

My fucking phone keeps running out of storage 💀 One photo is NOT the equivalent of two videos
I need the storage for the aurora
11k pictures isnâ€™t â€œonlyâ€ 😭😭
Damn aurora might be fire tonight
Are people still meeting?
at the right there seems to be a streak of aurora, see
yeah just phone
Last time I saw one I had to have a certain setting enabled or disabled
You need to have this on
Itâ€™s still grey on my phone for some reason, but my camera is capturing it
I just donâ€™t have a tripod :(
sad
its supposed to get better in a few hours right?
Damn
I think part of the reason Iâ€™m seeing it worse than monday is because most people are still awake.
I propped my phone up on a roll of duck tape instead of holding it and I think the stability makes a big difference
That thing will stop working as soon as you take a single photo
wtf where are you?
Not anymore though
Someone with a key just so happened to be there
So I took a quick photo and left
Will come if you swipe me a boba though
You need to mobile order it
Iâ€™m there already
yeah i realized that after i sent
can you still see anything in the field over there
dafuq jolly scholar doesn't do meal swipes for boba
OH

If you can convince someone else to swipe, I will come
I have a low IQ sorry
Still
Not seeing much anymore 😔
I think the peak has probably passed
Iâ€™m still studying
Iâ€™m probably gonna be chilling out here for another 2 hours or so nothing better to do
FUCK
Fair, but still
If you do end up needing help with it tho lmk
@casasdefender also fell in my footsteps

Arnav needs help with aleks now

What math are you in?
lmao i look dead inside

If I get 3 wishes from a genie, and then wish for the genie to be unable to count to 1 or 0, would I run out of wishes
you get [11] wishes
It doesnâ€™t understand the concept of a 1 or 0
"okay leo, you have used up half of two wishes. you now have two wishes left."
But then it could always just randomly say you run out of wishes without any warning
The genie needs to honor the genie rules
What if I made it understand and ground the definition and concept of 0 and 1, but ensured it could never be able to use such concepts again
simple:
I wish for all genies to be incapable of denying a person a wish.
question, or wish
Idk or hypotheticals
Yes Iâ€™m going crazy becuz Iâ€™m slightly sick
pain
I made a pickup line I feel Arnav would use unironically and immediately get a restraining order for doing so
Iâ€™m considering chugging hot sauce to blast away the pressure in my nose rn lol
I donâ€™t have that 😔😔
Also Mariah Careyâ€™s all I want for Christmas is you is just the Christmas version of rickrolling

I'M DOOMED WITHOUT THE COMFORT OF LEO'S FEET
Arnav lie down on the ground outside face up

Not for long, we're still in Chem 111
I'm doomed for the exam
If you need help studying lmk
Oh crap I forgot about physics
I never have any clue what im doing in chem
Idk we'll see what is right first tho
drew meyer gave the explanation and I still don't understand
who knows where we can study for this unit
Itâ€™s genuinely feeling such a disaster cuz I feel so fried
how many more classes do you have today
I have phys 122 in 3 hours
It doesnt start till 12:30
Or I just need to be pulled apart a little rn
y'all the difficulty of my classes is gonna make me sick
Why does the chem exam have to be next week
math121 (easy) to chem111 (AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!) to phys121 (ezpz)
Oh you have the 3 hour sack stroker marathon
IM CRYING
Omg
And I thought the 500 emails unread in my inbox were bad 💀
I haven't played in so long
I can't go back to mihoyo in college 😔
I need to lock in
a near god-like experience
fueling the cause
Rip
I want it tho, I want Inscryption so bad
oooo I need to play that
Damn I leave for like 10-15 minutes to eat and I come back to 100+ messages
I only saw gameplay of it recently but it looks so good (and something I'll be terrible at lol)
I have sunk hundreds of hours into both
someone gifted me terraria but I never played it
i need a mountain dew
or i'm gonna cry
don't do stupid shit like this you'll regret for the rest of your life 🙏
Out of curiosity, how many credits are you taking this semester?
You donâ€™t
i'm gonna fucking vomit
Oh my
Are you okay? Do you need to step outside for some fresh air for a sec?
i did a really shitty choice for my classes
i'm going from really easy to FUCKING HELLISH TIER HARD back to stuff i already know
At least is isnâ€™t all hellish
it feels like i'm on a rockboat with my current schedule
i literally feel carsick rn
i guess
Seems fitting
but i still feel carsick
i feel like i'm a pendulum
i didn't have breakfast so that might be another cause lol
why i feel like trash
That isnâ€™t good
That would kill you
i'm in class
idk
why're you pissed off tho i legit didn't have time to have breakfast
No food+caffine = bad
i want to gts
i'm gonna fall asleep on the sack stroker chairs
Arnav just lost so much aura
the fuck
i didn't even have the chance to walk into leutner or wtvr
which takes about 15 minutes which i don't have
you dont have to sit down at dunkin
Itâ€™s because Iâ€™m short on time to leave the house
i stay up late doing homework -> wake up late -> run to class -> no time for stuff
not sleep late
sleep late wake up at 5
Computer gaming, with another minor âœ…
Computer gaming with another minor 💀
THE SHEET SAID COMPUTER GAMING, MINOR
NOT COMPUTER GAMING MINOR
for 3 mins total
That moment when youâ€™re just unable to stay awake in any class from sheer exhaustion
If you go to JapanCase instead of resting I might actually get upset
Iâ€™m prob gonna rest holy fuck
I havenâ€™t been this exhausted since last December
Deadass I got the flu last December (on Christmas Day to add insults and injuries) and stayed sick all the way till new years
It works till it doesnâ€™t
Never been happier to get back to Clarke (thatâ€™s a sentence you donâ€™t hear)
wtf
I don't, sorry
holy shit
like damn
Oh was that today?
Man keeps forgetting Clarisse commutes 💀
Leoâ€™s dying rn
Posaibly death
fucking parties
man i need a drink
you do you but i want my cognitive abilities intact
i'm not doing shit tn anywayh
Iâ€™m still tired and feeling âœ¨weirdâœ¨
I feel like a clam
good (boy i missed you)
Do you want to be blocked again
Iâ€™m still sick so Iâ€™m just going slightly crazy lmao
And that laptop was an 8GB 2017 intel MacBook
Omg
Hopefully that won't be my macbook in the next two years
Oh no that was becuz I hated my district and trying to destroy the laptop lmao
I actually crashed my laptop doing that cuz it ran out of storage too temporarily
Damn
It was an anemic 2017 MacBook Air that was losing to a p sturdy 2012 MacBook Pro
My district also made us pay $100 a year to use it too for 4 years, and it was so bad I actually daily drove a 2012 MacBook Pro for the last 2 years of high school
Said MacBook Pro was originally my dads, and was originally the family laptop. Additionally, it was so old it had a CD drive built into it
my macbook cant run more than two windows
I know some of them donâ€™t so
So far it hasn't overheated, but also I haven't used it in a warm room on top of a heavy blanket for 30+ minutes yet
Imagine not having a chonky half inch thick laptop with 2 small palm sized fans in it
Ngl I miss my yoga tho
Idk if it's just because I'm not used to the macOS but macOS is so complicated, I want Windows 10 back
And no Iâ€™m not using Linux cuz Iâ€™ve never rly used it and I donâ€™t want to experiment while doing hw
That's fair lol
Bro Meyer's excitement when the class put in only one answer into the clickers is something I won't forget for a long time
Idk what word to use to describe how his joy made me feel, but it was memorable for sure
doesn't he look like meyer tho
Sort of? Not really?
GUYS THERE'S A DEAD SUBREDDIT DEDICATED TO DREW MEYER
oh dear
bruh I'm never going to fix my sleep schedule
Leutner is 1 fork, spoon, and knife short. Because they are bent and stolen
bored fr
Fr
Im currently running on 3.5 hours max
Smh even I didn't go this crazy in that building
And taplin 4th apparently
wtf
He didnt report people for drinking alcohol is the official reason
"college students will be college students, just please don't be a dumbass and show up at my room and say 'WANNA GET FUCKED UP' with a bud light in hand because that's trouble for you and paperwork for me."
that's different. If an RA sees something and doesn't report it, that's cause for them to be fired
"drink if you want but don't be a dumbass about it"
(They spelt my name wrong)
Idk how to do that
I love being sick (no I donâ€™t itâ€™s literally made me so unproductive god dammit)
*sigh*
Iâ€™m slogging thru phys 122 hw anyways
Chem 111 people we don't need to know the non-ideal gas law right? Only what it means?
idk
It *is* on the equation sheet though
fair
i think ive paid attention to around 3 chem lectures since the last test
still can't get over the fact @katsukurry_32009 just left the asmr pic up on her screen for a good 5 minutes for everyone to see
Starting to get the feeling Clarisse likes the asmrâ€¦
I mean I wonâ€™t complain
Iâ€™m trying to pay attention in class, even though I keep falling asleep in it
Thatâ€™s why I have a whole pack of tic tacs now, so when I get sleepy I can have some mint to make me feel more awake
Iâ€™m trying but failing, so thereâ€™s a good chance Iâ€™m cooked for the test anyway
That bad?
damn
AWWW
oh... 😭
oh aww
although genshin player and touching grass does seem slightly paradoxical 🫢
and i haven't touched genshin in a month
they don't go to cwru???
this is just kinda weird tho tbh 😭
AWW doggo
Carlos Sainz? Idk (Iâ€™m not an F1 fan)
how do you know sainz without being an F1 tho
same energy as knowing max verstappen without knowing what F1 is at all
Also when my friends tried getting me into F1 they â€œchoseâ€ Sainz for me
but next year will be sad 😔🥲
wtf
Danny Ric didn't even survive this season 😭💀
Oh yeah forgot about him
genuinely was sad when he announced it was his final race

as long as code isn't shared i think helping is okay?
you will actually die
You Are Going To Die An Early Death
eh im slated to die by like 21
Arenâ€™t we supposed to discourage Arnav from doing this? Why are you also doing this?
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DIE THAT EARLY
lowkey my outlook on life is kinda... bad
idk
Donâ€™t make me drive over there illegally, break into your dorm, and take it by force
you need to sleep
Hot idea: we all shut our devices off and go to sleep
im sorry to hear that :((
i feel like we need to address this
I feel that tbh
we don't open the box
Things Need To Be Unpacked Before They Cause Problems
Bottling things up = bad
Leaving Your Problems To Rot Inside WILL Fuck You Up Later
Iâ€™m too awake for that
nah man we need to stage an intervention for you
I have 1500 word essay due end of today 😭
or autism idk lmao
death is an inevitable part of life, but you can still live beautifully while knowing this fact
Are you trying to change the subject?

i think you need to slow down and relax a bit buddy
this was after a 5 day out of school orchestra event where I had no time to do work and all my group mates abandoned me to do the work
(hence why I don't rly do collaborative work anymore cuz of that, I got burned so badly by that)

You are sick

im not sure when i wore that tho
tis time for sad song
omg we have the same feed
i got a long weekend of nothing
damn
rn im chillin at BW. i go here tho, my friend sent me the invite and i didnt even know this existed
damn only decently
I will be there in spirit if you guys need anything
that's honestly what i need for my ADHD
a calendar to remind me that i did or forgot to do stuff
today starship officially became the most reusable rocket*

*didnâ€™t reuse hotstage ring, so not 100% reusable yet
*proven to be capable of landing the upper stage on land, but will not do it this flight
MY FUCKING BRAINCELLS
i'm applying for some shit
my braincells are dying
Chances are I wonâ€™t be there
Starting at 1
Oh
how many gbs of memory is that taking
idk
Ooo I miss MS Paint
I found it in high school when my school banned a bunch of drawing apps from being used on laptops
i feel like trash
Is 123 terribly bad?
it's very hard to improve CARS
it's the section that makes most premed students cry
Hard as they may be
Besides, you're a freshman, you still have time to work towards a higher score
Just because you don't get a high score now doesn't mean you're not making it to med school
thereâ€™s junior premeds who dont even know if theyâ€™re taking the mcat
Yeah CARS is hard to improve but I'm assuming that this is 3rd party, and 3rd party CARS isn't very indicative of AAMC CARS so i wouldn't put much weight into that score
it was meeee (no it wasn't lmao, the phys 122 hw is beating my ass)
I only have question 2 left because i went to the hw session but ik my answers are wrong
my answers feel wrong for questions 2d and 3e
but that's cuz thsi thing is actually crazy hard imo
sorry what?
unironically peak weather
ah fuck
i better not be on the same damn plane home in december
which plane u getting on
fuck no
this isn't gonna happen until you actually show up to practice 🥲
please come Leo we miss you 🥲🥲
gf threatened to mute me if i went cuz i'm still not fully recovered
fair
i miss kendo
were u in wade commons pioneer room last night
i heard someone sit down and talk about energy drink habits or shit like that and i was thinking "man that reminds me of that one guy on CWRU 2028"
oh it wasnt
i didnt go up and talk lmao
i only had one coffee today and i feel like i'm gonna vomit
the OSU player goes outside and touches grass
cuz half my school goes to that bloody school
what if u cold turkey for a bit
she would probably be really concerned
damn bro
and i thought i was doing badly some weeks ago
without caffeine, i feel like i'm about to black out
Should I buy the Hitman games, and turn my laptop into a jet engine
Would it work if he slowly and gradually decreased his caffeine intake?
i cant really slander anyone on caffeine intake tho as i get a headache and minor sickness when i dont get coffee by 2 pm
Theres a peter griffin death pose in this image
Now that I've burned myself by touching a hot tray that came out of the oven two minutes prior, I realized I have zero sense of taking care of myself
So I nudged it gently with my ring finger and now there's a good red line on it that hurts when I wash my hands with warm water
It could have been worse
Well it didnâ€™t happen
does @anyone have a past chem 111 exam?
like before like past exams
(im not in the class im asking for my roommate)
Oh like from this year?
OH- isnâ€™t on there
But you can remember it as â€œinsoluble except with Castro Bearâ€
(i could be wrong)
Me leaving the most UNsimplified 14 parameter answer for PHYS 121 HW
Help guys, thereâ€™s too many worms on the ground 😭
Bro why does â€œStill Aliveâ€ from portal sound vaguely similar to FIFTY FITY by Cupid
Someone should make a mashup
meyer when he finishes the delightful exam knowing half the class will get fucked statistically
An average of 78 isnâ€™t horrible, thatâ€™s a B
though that's hard to do because the bell curve isn't symmetrical and we don't know the standard deviation lol
Can't do that unless I tell you that the sd is 15 right
guys just use the empirical rule. but still we don't know the std.
I GOT FUCKED BY THE PHYS121 EXAM
THE FUCK
WTF
oh my dumbass forgot to show my work for the whole second problem 💀 nvm
Chem is actually so wild, like half of our year is in this class
You will never catch me in a chem or phys class !
No shade im just a bit slow
He goes kinda fast, he just reads off the slides and then CLICKERQUESTIONGO
Almost any stem degree needs chem and physics in p sure so
Canâ€™t wait to take another chem class after this (im gonna die)
Math doesnt
CE doesnâ€™t
Im probably not going to take 145 for 2 years because i dont want to do chem and physics combo again next fall
Tho I donâ€™t have to take any more physics next semester
Apparently Alp (the difficult spring prof) isn't teaching that class anymore and that the new spring prof is a lot easier then Alp was 

But I do still hear the fall prof is better
Have fun incoming phys 122, labs suck
Cuz my next semester is guaranteed to be:
-AIQS (3)
-MUTH 102 (4)
-MUAP (2)
-MUDE (1)
-MATH 224 (3)
- another class of 6 credits total
And like stupid easy
Isnâ€™t it your PE credit
the syllables don't matter as much its to help you be able to say it quickly easily because the emphasis you would use to choose a phrase goes out the window once you drill things enough
it's not that hard u got this
I donâ€™t got time 😭
Prob overkill method but itâ€™s the most brain dead method
Is Stellic just stupid or is 122 actually not offered next semester
PHYS courses arenâ€™t published yet because there is great evil in the world
Yeah no idk lmao
Fernando isnâ€™t teaching it either next semester and Fernando gives such easy tests itâ€™s crazy
Doesnâ€™t matter
i think i forgot how to basic math
But if you would like to see what we went over still, look at the 10/14 class notes under 121
Are you just trying to trick us into doing your hw? 🤔
I've been trying to do these 2 problems during Chem  and couldn't figure it out
which doesn't look good for me
no but i will not be falling asleep by then
you're gonna cry every night wishing you never took it
feels like high school gifted class but on steroids
I was trying to find why leaf skeletons donâ€™t really get destroyed easily after being soaked in a ph11 solution, but the closest thing to an explanation I could find was on Reddit
My aiqs isnt bad i just dont want to take it
In class discussions in AIQS were rough cause only a few people ever did the readings :(((
i want to know if it is possible to bastardize a sphere
either
idk
oh by huggbees
idk why you were refusing to watch
If you look really hard at a sphere you could perhaps map it to a torus, but I canâ€™t think of any nice properties that would be maintained beyond like, yeah itâ€™s a smooth shape. A torus is not homeomorphic to a sphere
for one of the items i didn't know
so i don't accelerate
i used to do circuits at home for giggles
but like in the sense of dr. fernando saying tldr stop cheating in the hw, it's not worth it and making my job a pain
fork wants kids with socket
you get another socket after 9 months
im sorry w h a t
no ben don't encourage arnav
fair
and it's not the amperage that hurts you
lest he decides to seriously test it
that's the one thing that annoys me about the acronym emf and it's the fact it's voltage even tho the acronym makes more sense to stand as electromagnetic fields
Damn my English teacher in 8th grade was an insane fundamentalist Christian soccer mom not a magic crystal 5g insane person
The Horrors of Technology still came up every now and then tho
idk what would be peak neurodivergency
(that isn't arnav)
fuck
I want to multiply you by the concubine.
That looks so awful wtf
how the fuck
@leowhygamma  should we experiment in the bedroom and find out??
Arnav go study your chem 111 stuff
yeah i'm studying the molecules in semen rn wanna help?
nah i already got cockblocked
Arnav reminds me of my middle school and early high school years where half the jokes were bad sex jokes
Hi garlic noodles (i still dont know who you are)
Hey do u understand module 8 in math
I donâ€™t get it at all
He seems like one of the teachers of all time
Just so many cases like Iâ€™m lost
Wtf does it mean???
Also holy fuck
Also itâ€™s surprisingly quiet rn without Arnav saying smtg
oh dear
nope
How long is the PHYS 122 lab this week?
i haven't looked at it
never trust any of your thoughts past 9 pm
(I shouldnâ€™t  skate in rain )
anyone here taken the chem 111 quiz yet?
There's a quiz today? 💀
Also if anyone went to the Math 121 review last night, do you have the answer for number 5 on the review sheet?
idk I assumed there was going to be a quiz today
ik drew meyer doesn't do quizzes the week AFTER the exam
FUCK
to quote butler, "SKIBIDI SHIT"
So how are you feeling on the cooked index?
unless i suffered some kind of brain damage that took away my ability to do physics, i prolly got a 9/10 or a 10/10
chemistry goes over my head
but physics + math goes straight through my heart
Top is chem, middle is physics, bottom is math
bottom is physics and math
Yeah, im just a lost cause with chem atp
yeah i hate chemistry
anyone want to do a chem review sesh this afternoon/evening at ksl
I'm panting like a dog rn
Did I mention?
Meyer did the â€œBUBBLEBUBBLEBUBBLEBUBBLEâ€ thing in class yesterday
we study for chem
I'm doing a past chem exam for practice... what does this word say...
oh ty
does someone have a calculator
my TI-86 middle column buttons are not working ;-;
Did you lose yours?
aka the 2, 5, 8, open parentheses, cos, and delete button doesn't work
Oh dear
tho you don't need to trudge thru the rain
i thought i heard it raining
did he go over that in class?
im not even in chem 111/105 💀
my bad
where is the 111 practice exam
Nope
Modules > "Previous Exams"
If I recall correctly basically bonds can be arranged in different ways but still yield the same molecules
oh weird
I haven't taken ochem tho yet
Can someone help me explain why this is the answer? 🙏
How do we find reaction types
Yeah thats what it had on the pratice exam
I know nothing about redox
fair enough
Lose electrons Oxidated
Gain electrons Reduced
This is gonna always fuck with my brain
I canâ€™t tell if butler is being particularly wild this lecture or if itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m actually paying attention
If it has way too much pressure compared to the outside, it will explode, and if it has too little pressure compared to the outside, it won't fully inflate
I didn't fail that exam
maybe they were just bad
I JUST HUNG A FUCKING QUEEN IN CHESS
this is why you don't play chess in class
youth these days never had to manage memory 😔
lmao C is a pain in the ass to code in
hey math majors what's a bifurcation
woops wrong message
Nah this server never dying
You can pry it from my cold dead hands
isnt this the guy who uh
I wanna say Hannibal but I've never watched Hannibal
Oh shit I'm right
If we cut ur bangs u could be him for Halloween alan
Damn ok
Chat I need to be honest I've never played persona 5 😭😭😭
i own it tho
HEY I DONT GOT MONEY
holy shit
Ok some needs to teach me how to pirate games
what game u want
dont play persona 5 after persona 3 and 4
youâ€™ll be disappointed bc p5 is the worst
oh 💀
p5 is the worst, p5r is the best
(but havent finished 💀 )
its weird cuz inaba feels so cozy now
poor teddie
i want to play p3 reload so bad
Damn
That's still weird from u bc it's ooc
oh that's why I've been getting notifications about an airpod
im waking up
seems like he wanted a cookie
sprinkler system don't work for the kitchens
Me who napped on my desk for an hour and a half as a reward
Also tragically no spinach sandwich this week (Iâ€™m too tired for that this week)
Omg
I love how you left the ai response in at the end
i was laughing so hard i got an asthma attack
FUCK
i still have to watch season 2
i donâ€™t remember anything that happens between end of play and the like. movie arc 💀
nope
i more so read manga that hasnt gotten an anime adaptation
i wasnt lol
i'm not even loud while studying
second to last piece overall
wtf
@mism0937 won't let me sleep @katsukurry_32009
Now that I think about it you do stay up pretty late tho Kyle
I'm going to campus early tomorrow again :')
Gives me time to work on my lab report tho bc I spent basically the entire evening procrastinating
i have no immediate homework either
Rip
I have one class thursday
Ah okay that's not too bad I think
so anyway chem 111 club how did we all do on the exam.
surprised it hasn't been discussed yet.
you should see my tuesday schedule, it sucks
Should I take a few hours of napping and then work on calc
My Thursday is awful
It's 11:27, consider going to sleep and waking up early instead
I have 8:25 am music theory, and my day doesnâ€™t end until 10 pm
Nope lol, you can try to arrange it however you want as long as you get the class spot
Holy crap that's horrible
ouch
i'm gonna fall asleep on the spartique couch
bc my tuesday is 11:30 - 8:00 no breaks, but my wednesday is 8:25 - 8:30 but with a 3 hour break
Now that I think about it, it still might be early for you, but do you have an idea of what classes you'll be taking Reef? Just out of curiosity
genuinely nope
i took IB so i havenâ€™t the fairest clue what that translates to here at this school
I think some IB credits are taken
Oh you donâ€™t
i got math history and language creds
Tragically you canâ€™t use those for your elective credits
wait real question, is it hard to find a job on campus without federal work study
Idk
I have work study granted and technically a job thru the music department
I havenâ€™t had time to work tho
i didnâ€™t wanna take work study because it was 8.75 an hour
Iâ€™d say most of the work study here pays fairly well (I think the lowest Iâ€™d seen was $11)
now if i had known that id taken it
You have to look around and Handshake isnâ€™t always reliable for that
wish they paid $17.50 an hour like they do in new york
Damn youâ€™re from New York?
Iâ€™m from Texas and I got shafted for my last job, I got paid max like $11/hour yet was teaching tkd to like 10 children every hour
You donâ€™t
iâ€™m a weightlifter rather
oh shit
I'm sure archery club is fun but my schedule doesn't allow me to go
and I wanted to pick up a different martial arts involving weapons so
can't
it needs an actual instructor (aka a 4th degree black belt)
i'm one degree short
I had to do like. an online module. and a brief session with someone with a level 3 certification and now I'm a certified archery instructor.
there's a whole bureaucracy with the taekwondo federation too so
holy christ that sounds like a pain and a half
idk never been to one
ohio still lower
if its terrible im actually gonna cry
i am a lot less open about it besides the majin boo pfp
going to school that is less than a 1/4 mile away? driven to by using a highway
never again
I thought you went back to bed?
sleep deprived man tells sleep deprived man to get sleep
8 hours of sleep
caffeine actually has negative work on me
Damn
I drink it and it makes me more sleepy than I started with unless I'm deleriously tired
coffee doesnt work i need celsius
but my caffeine withdrawals seem to be fading
i didnâ€™t get a headache today
as long as he isnâ€™t like my physics teacher i can handle him
(I'm dying help lmao)
im already getting enough lore
long story short he married his college student right after she graduated and they both teach physics at my high school, iâ€™ve seen them smash in the chem lab table during free periods
that feels illegal
WTF
oh dear.
i guess
Yeah before they decide to leave
they need to experience the chaos that is the people on discord in person, not on discord
You know what you're not wrong
you left up that ASMR picture for everyone to see tho lmao
i would if i wasnâ€™t 2 hours away from home
I need to do my calc hw
lmao i slept while doing my ALEKS yesterday on my bed and my laptop fell late at night
go lock in gal, no one said you need to be on discord
I'm stupid
normally i would be like "FUCK" but i legit just whimpered and went back to bed
I'm gonna save physics for tomorrow, I'm tired and will regret it later
leo go to sleep i think you direly need it
my dm's to clarisse is so much worse lmao
I can't do this anymore
i suck at mechanics btw
i have once again realized that i have never met any of you
really?
you fucking cunt i was trying to fall asleep and i saw that
Really? I didn't know actually
its a weird experience for me ive never met someone with my name
i do need to sleep some point soon
iâ€™m 17 still 💀
Oh fuck
makes ur birthday seem rly far away
tis also my fault tho i havent figured out what a healthy sleep schedule is
Hmm that's fair Muhsin
that is to say, there isn't one
im gonna sleep 16 hours on saturday and wake up at 4pm like a healthy person
i have 4 days to fix it
(my sleep schedule will not exist till the summer)
Nah just don't be like us
i am a very bad example
If you've got lots of work to do I find it helps to sleep early and wake up early so that as soon as I wake up my mind is clear
that is to say, constantly dying, committing arson, and building houses of out random shit
i can just survive off not that much sleep as long as i oversleep on weekends
late to bed and early to rise makes a man dead and unwise
Go sleep
The longer the night goes on the more fucked we are likely to be
i had 4 hours of naps today
i feel rested
im
an hour away from home
she has that saved on her phone like the bible
Jokes on you I don't have enough storage to save a video
oh dear
I can't even take photos anymore without using my notes app
I'm going to be so fr idk how this one happened
That's the thing tho, I literally don't know from what 😭
nope
don't get clarke tower if you can help it lmao
Also you're still awake?
oh?
why is it considered the worst?
dragon ball legends has sapped so much money from me
oh jeez
Noo don't pay
i no longer get desperate
do you have it set to never deleting message history?
damn so youâ€™re just chatting it up huh
I'd rather not find out what that means
What the actual fuck
i don't want to know
What if I just upload that to my drive too
shut the fuck up
Ahhh okay I didn't get that at first (I am cooked for AIQS)
it was, now it's smtg much worse
Oh crap
even as a possible english major I hate AIQS
i have no clue what's in store for me for that class
I can't believe it's that bad 😔 I'm so cooked
i don't mind interpreting text, but if it's to a bullshit level i'm gonna fucking
Imagine if we end up in the same AIQS
leave
Arnav you may need to go to bed more than the rest of us do
i don't
someone does
CS -> "Commuter Student" (That's for Arnav to know tho)
i also live in ohio i simply dont feel like commuting
Muhsin's also from Ohio if I recall correctly tho
if i tried commuting itâ€™d take me 7 hours
Computer Science, Commuter Student, Carlos Sainz, etc.
Makes me want to be in Japan right now
whoever lives with arnav, take away his internet privileges
okay that image cropped just looks wrong 💀
Wa happen?
revoke his internet privileges
Oh
I miss the Connor pfp
already happened
Never thought we'd be using the chem knowledge for this
Stop that brings back unrelated memories
During a bio lab my friend got cut by a broken pipette I think
then 9 months
i can one up you, I broke my phone during a physics lab
i cannot observe this much longer
dropped a 150 gram weight from like a meter height, landed perfectly on the right side of my phone, likely crushed the cables under the screen and disabled my screen for an entire day
trying to do my lab
I drop a 150 kilogram weight because I didn't check the units on the aleks problem
can i drop an antonov-225 on arnav's head
but seriously tho i must sleep i will hate myself
i forgot russia destroyed it
Gn, sweet dreams! And don't hate yourself, you're really amazing, you just don't give yourself enough credit
RIP
oh dear
I've been tweaking since like 10 am today
Just take away his caffeine
Idk it's cute tho
idk
Oh lord
hear me out, what if, stay with me, what if we just revoke his internet privileges
tragically he's so brainrotted that the internet is unfortunately a thing he needs
isn't that like over 1000 mg of caffeine
and i thought 2 bobas, a celsius, and pre workout in one day was bad
bro you're gonna actually want to die if you do that
idk
don't say that
fair
oh no
heâ€™s nothing compared to the typical homeless bum on the subway
who in the fuck is the genalpha if it's not you
i shit you not
Oh my
what in the fuck lmao
however if you speak a language a man has grown up on, you get to his heart
Damn I see lmao
What I want from you: 🤐 + 😴
New idea: we all get off of Discord, close our devices, tuck ourselves in our beds, close our eyes, and sleep
my ipad does need to be charged ngl
Bruh didn't you get sick because you fell asleep at your desk?
YOU NEED TO PRIORITIZE YOUR HEALTH
i'm scared of kyle
I'm still trying to figure out who this person is
didnâ€™t yall literally head to bed
Just not asleep
fair
you're gonna meet someone who's either begging for death or unhinged lmao
gn clarisse, donâ€™t let them bed bugs bite!
Unfortunately I don't handle caffeine well because I don't really drink it
Out of curiosity: why are you arriving so early?
to do drugs /j (idk the actual reason)
i think sheâ€™s a commuter and needs extra time
I still only have my permit, so I can't drive on my own
what happened
Plus usually on every other Thursday like today I can sleep in but I have a psych experiment I need to participate in to pass the class
that implies someone is literally chained to the concrete at cwru
what we need to do to a specific individual
Oh screw you
luckyyyy (had glasses since i was 6)
Why is the discord so active this isnt chem 111 time
nvm donâ€™t need it
I have a class at 8:30 but im not tired
Who says it isnâ€™t?
iâ€™ll still be taller than you all
I wish i could rest but i cant skip aiqs again
Man I lowkey want to do ochem next semester but also I know I will regret it
girl you gon regret this conversation in the morning when you canâ€™t get up
I already feel cold (which happens if I stay up too late)
then go to sleep
Kyle's probably gonna say "nah" tho
â€œlooks like most of the class went with e. some people said it was f. those people are wrong, because obviously only hessâ€™ law is a pokemon. okey-doke!â€
Damn
makes sense, and I'm not telling you to add him back, just stating a thing I noticed (and damn I feel sorry for you guys kinda just having to deal with that sorta unfun moderating)
I wouldnâ€™t this late
average times japan says their open hours
so technically the den's operating hours would be 16:00 till 26:00
10 hours straight of serving food
Iâ€™m only just now going back and looking at all the chaos that happened while I was locking in
I think you need to rest
Bad Leo
i'll sleep when I'm dead (or my calc is done)
got 4.5 hours of sleep chat
Oh man
How the fuck am I getting better sleep then y'all. step it up
There was nothing to do
Side note- leutner is doing like an open survey of what they want in November
Also I kinda lowkey am curious how many engineers here wanted to become one initially becuz of unhinged YouTube engineers
Can you guess?
law school is no more begging on the streets it is
My brain? Still mush
Oh it was horrible. 10/10 woudl not recommend
If you look towards the museum in Tink its to the left
I havenâ€™t had a chance to kinda go out
fair
Bro did windows language switching thing just brick up my laptop wtf
i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a smart idea
i still have to update mine for like 3 years now
iâ€™d rather hit that up than spend money
its on southside tho so a bit of an adventure
only reason why i dont use both my swipes on it
oh shit maybe i should spend a meal swipe on boba today...
lowkey i want some asian food like badly
idk
idk miles
thatâ€™s not even that bad
fuck yeah
case cash is reaching near 0 money sadly
i have not spent a single dime of mine yet
There's tippit tea in carlton commons. I've heard it's decent
i got the milk tea once and didnt have the best experience
I miss japan's food still. Deadass when I came back from japan I had a chick-fil-a and it made me cry of sadness cuz it tasted so mid
i just realized iâ€™m gonna miss nyc food
what do you mean i canâ€™t get 20 dumplings for $4
damn
Still canâ€™t believe all this was so cheap
Like guess the price of how much this was
Im assuming this wasnt in ohio
it was at haneda airport in japan
got to do some plane spotting there too (that's where i saw the passenger version of the queen of the skies)
ohhhh, i miss california food so badly
thinking about food and japan is such a deadly combo cuz the food in japan is actual fucking fire
i need to go once because i have family there
thereâ€™s like traces of british and pakistani blood
lowkey i want to do a 23&me test
I donâ€™t like physics mechanics so
(i thought it was pork but the internet says chicken)
when are martens office hours
honestly idk. I checked the syllabus and it just says "TBD or by appointment"
sorry
u mean u didnt get a choice at character select when u were born? wtf
Shit I think they forgor to give me character select at the beginning 😭 I'd like to return to character design screen pls
im still speccing some points into autism/ADHD
guys please invest in physical i put nothing in it and now cant breathe at night
I have the permanent debuff of weird knees that I can't uncheck
No????? I wish I'd gotten options
I need a character screen chat
chat i went back to the starting screen, its not letting me change my height
inhaler buffs dont last long enough 😪
Damn the time limit must suck on those
idk if those are buffs man thats a debuff negation
Damn all my points just got put into silly
all my points were unused cuz what the hell
(My brains so dead a patient in cardiac arrest would be more alive)
Nope
Well as Sophie said, thatâ€™ll be you if you donâ€™t take a break
When you consider I havenâ€™t been able to practice properly for nearly 2 weeks yes
I want to play cuz it physically prevents me from doing hw
Yes!!! Just don't spend any money
Never give in
The grind must never stop
Sigh
What are all of your plans for this break, out of curiosity?
Not die
I just realized
The existence of nasal decongestant medicine implies the existence of nasal congestant meds, which all it does is make your noses and throat insanely stuffy via a pill/liquid
Because why would you want your nose to be congested?
Idk
I need to get back into running
Freshman 15 has hit hard and i feel like my blood has become Den condiments
Sounds and is are very different, I love to think about running and then by the time i get a mile or two in i want to die
i need to beat stellar blade
some missions are very bad tho
Bad in what way?
Luckily she still has to beat FFX
do you want me to send a clip
The prince rly danced with Cinderella the whole night, could not remember her face, and just like looked at every womanâ€™s feet in the kingdom to compensate for the fact he has piss poor memory
Also more common thought: the prince from Snow White and the seven dwarves is a creep and needs a restraining order
Isnâ€™t that sleeping beauty?
I guess not
The prince essentially just kidnaps a dead body or kisses a dead body depending on what media itâ€™s told thru
he never abandoned rapunzel
I didnâ€™t say shit you cannot assume what I was gonna say
theyâ€™ll never get his nose right </3
I completely forgot i screenshot this earlier
Also musicians what does this make you feel
I feel like I'm crazy but it's been so long since I've touched a piano that I can't tell
Sloppy work
i think she got locked up in a room full of rats though
I don't like it when the scurry around in circles in the lab
Because theyâ€™re the bestagons infinitely tiling a plane
Maybe? Idk I'm not a rat or mice owner
You canâ€™t beat the bestagon
He doesnâ€™t know what Euclid avenue is yet
isnt that like in the campus
Ohhhhh (I forgot about that)
What does that mean I don't get geometry at all
only important geometry i remember is how to cut the pizza into enough slices in papas pizzeria
Me whoâ€™d cut it like shit on purpose
I kinda want to learn what all of that means but I kinda don't
i dont speak math
trust me, you dont 😭
IM CRYING
Actual fucking chaos
What happened?
WTF
i wish
Let your sister have some of the mayo off your burger for your fries before you eat it so you don't get a heart attack or something (for a premed student my medical knowledge is shit so idk)
To my TA, I am so sorry I have 51 Figures worth of calculations
I turned in a 20 page lab report to my TA and I know for a fact he did not read all of it
Fuck my phone isn't scanning documents because it's too full of storage
Idk
Anyways Iâ€™m gonna go sleep for once
IDK
i pray that you somehow delete anything in your phone
BUT THERES STILL SO MUCH MORE LEFT
I have 131.3 gb of photos in the cloud, dont ask about on my laptopâ€¦
I do, but ive almost used the whole 200gb
Not bad either
No your homework folder cannot be on the 2TB
If I distribute all of my stuff over 2USBs, the 100GB case gives us for our drive, my own personal google drive, my laptop, and my phone, I might just be set for the next few years
unfortunately theyre all used 🙏
its like the store you go to for anything you need concerning computers
Idk
Oh crap it's 12
Shit my phones at 3%
I mean I still get DMs from him
fair
I've become so chronically online since I started college it's so bad
Ive been so offline its bad
(I need to touch some)
Really?
WHY WONT THE PHOTO SEND
alex is struggling hard
Rip
Oh yeah I forgot you guys are in the same dorm
kyle come back and hit up king boo and steal stars
Sorry, I wish but I ainâ€™t playing
I wish I could see the chaos unfold in person
Omg I miss the wii
Have you ever tried the Wii steering wheel?
I still have mine lmao
FUCK YEAH
I only remember cuz I woke up a few hours later completely delirious
i missed it land because i71 traffic should be considered terrorism
You should consider joining the autism known as collecting an insane amount of plane liveries
brother i am already a plane autist
that looks like something ive seen in far cry
i loved it but my parents didn't
Korean air?
Nope
oh
Dallas international airport
oh
Itâ€™s French, so it doesnâ€™t matter
i have like 100gb worth of plane pictures on my computer
most are shit but i have some really decent ones
do you have a camera or do you just use your phone
Just my phone
tho tbf you can't fit much in either lmaoooo
Except the 737s
looks nothing alike
oh
it looks weird
The dreamlifter is objectively worse looking
Okay but the B-2 spirit has some fascinating history behind it
fair
Never
this shit is so funny and idk why
But still tho the flying wing as a concept is like still in active development
really neat history behind them
It would never work but it's so intriguing
I'd want to see those japanese submarines that could carry fighters in them
iâ€™m surprised yall went to bed early
considering how much these guys were cooking last night
iâ€™m surprised they went to sleep this early
i donâ€™t come till spring
Iâ€™m also still up
i might just sleep cuz i have my deadlift pr scheduled tmrw
He who shall not be named keeps himself and only himself up
So he isnâ€™t usually out at this time
Last CHEM 111 lecture of the quarter, how are we feeling
dead inside
Iâ€™m not even at twink yet
Dw Prof Meyer isn't even here yet
Iâ€™m totally gonna pay attention in class today
Yeah please donâ€™t try to become Arnav
More like we donâ€™t need to make the mods ban people cuz I donâ€™t think they enjoy doing that
someone did make a chris butler lightbox in engr 130
Apparently they have to enforce the fact making weapons at thinkbox is not allowed
Thinkbox policy bans weapons but does not have anything against NSFW, and some of my friends who are student techs have seen people print wild shit
I was never in chat, i was a lurker
Me to Arnav when he canâ€™t STFU
Omg it's methane, ethane, and propane!!
@leowhygamma r u gone come to fribl
For my school or?
Nope
I mean itâ€™s bad but there are worse things for sure
uh oh
You know what, now I feel the urge to run
we're never letting him even cook a damn pancake in the kitchen ever again
did you know he personally made every rocket and Tesla car
Yâ€™all still at Fribley?
Frib will be closed by the time cs lecture is o-
if you can somehow extend a 24 hour day to be 30 hours and remove sleep
this is a cry for help /j
youâ€™re going to need the philosophy after you turn
into aristotles from all the pressure wondering where it all went wrong
is bro trying to be triple unemployed
oh 😭
oh woww
all we had was spanish and the teachers kept quitting so we learned nothing 😭
you had the option to swap latin for greek though
not regular latin though
damn my gf did IB
i wish i got to properly learn a new language in HS
this looks so fun tho 😭
oh yeah nvm i just fucking hated my ap econ/gov teacher with such a burning passion that the gates of hell felt cold
idk tho looking back at my HS classes they were just not the best quality and i had no passion to learn the subjects
i wish i got to learn more
if you could take CAS (practically 10 separate volunteer practices) while writing an EE (4000 word research paper with charts and professional work citations) while also doing IAs (internal assessments which counted for 30% of your grade and required a years worth of work for each class) while trying not to succumb to the pressures of each class after spending a day of lunch each week learning about the theory of knowledge
idk what most of those words mean 💀
i kinda know what that means cuz my gf suffered IB
it was due in may
YOOOOOOOO SOMEONE WHO SUFFERED LIKE ME
My entire exam schedule cus i also did dual enrollment 🥲
idk whatâ€™s harder, A&A or A&I for math
i forgot which english i took 🙏
i feel extremely bad for you what the
Walked outta that class so many times
I am a victim of IB you are not alone!!
oh i didnt hear abt that lmao😭
Disnt hear abt that either
Iâ€™m gonna grab a boba and then head back so
Place doesnâ€™t open till 6pm ;-;
Unless it is open even at 3pm?
@leowhygamma How was 122 exam?
I could always go to Euclids then tho idk how good that one is
Well I prob didnâ€™t do 2.e correctly but besides that
Damn
(Please donâ€™t sic AIV on us lol)
Cuz the charge was on the inner sphere, inner shell only
I didnâ€™t think it was -Q/4pi epsilon
Cuz that was the same thing last test
The practice problems were like exactly the same as the problems on the test
I hated it because I was getting taught it while I didnâ€™t understand integrals
So I struggled so hard
Tho for 3d stuff its a little bit harder to understand integrals cuz its now the volume under a surface
Yeah ik that I just didnâ€™t understand what was variable or not
And then we pulled everything out and I was like wtf
Aka integrals will always have that â€œin respect to a variableâ€ and if itâ€™s not that variable and can be pulled away from it without changing the function itself it can be pulled out
If you want to be class of '31 sure
Yeah I slowly realized that through how Fernando taught
Took me a bit tho
Rly horrible analogy, but like itâ€™s how we do mixtures in chemistry. Aka you can separate a mixture of red and marbles, but you canâ€™t unmix red and blue dyes in a purple dye by hand
That makes it worse 😭
Idk how to explain how my brain brains
CS + math can graduate easily in 4 years. CS + music, I know one person doing and he takes 19 credits a semester but will graduate in 4 years. I also know a Math + Music and he's graduating in 4 years. Doing all three of those could possibly be 5 years if all BA, but it would be tight. Any BS makes it much harder. Then adding philosophy basically adds an extra year to your expected graduation time if your schedule is already so slammed with 2 or 3 of the others (or single cs bs)
It just idk, makes sense to me now lol
Am I stupid lmao
Nope from Texas (tho depending on what Texan you ask, theyâ€™ll say theyâ€™re technically international lmao)
Iâ€™ve talked to him a few times, he seems v chill lol
sorry
I'm usually dead after kendo and just wanna go back to dorms and crash
fair
Worst comes to worst you can give them to me /j
also im lowkey scared to buy a laptop cuz why are they so expensive
Have you used yours yet?
Unfortunately yeah
Cuz itâ€™s a pc plus monitor plus keyboard all rolled into one with a battery
i wouldnt buy one with a gpu but my parents arent letting me take my setup
i dont technically need one with a gpu because
oh i have swipes
i will think about it though
depends on how i feel after
I mean what are your expectations for laptop usage
Iâ€™m not sure, sorry
mhm i have one more left this week
I can put it in my laptop as a secondary storage
imagine being able to modify your laptop
Since the m.2 2280 slot is already filled in on my laptop but not the 2230 slot
Out of curiosity do you need swipes or can you just pay with cash/card for the boba at Carlton?
You can pay money
Damn
Heres the hours for everything over fall break
cleveland airport is fun
25 pity guaranteed and 7 wishes
I will get Sunday (I don't know what I will use him for)
I SAW JACK BLACK IN TBE AIRPORT

This is bad
however saying "doesn't smell like anything here" is weird
uh just general usage (i.e. homework and netflix) and also games (valorant with a hint of dishonored, possibly cyberpunk)
there is nothing to eat
i will be poor soon
im just gonna starve for a few hours
Jolly is still open so
So long as you donâ€™t get hungryâ€¦
And anyone else who wants to see if they want to plan
I was actually looking for places to go and found a few but they all need a bus ride
11 am tmw idk?
Place? Idk
Itâ€™s a bus drive and small walk away
And I really want pancakes
thats alot of dead heretics
i didnt know u could do all that in crusader kings
i thought it was just about battles and shit
It can be but if you play games wrong enough it becomes a different game
damn his videos r like 1-2 hours
Man Iâ€™ve been craving waffles and leutner just canâ€™t satiate me
Idk how but Leutner waffles are slightly sour

Iâ€™m tweaking so hard rn
i can't disassemble it fukcckkcckckkckck
i can't
you donâ€™t have like. a skinny pair of tweezers?))
i don't wanna break smtg
tried that already
Damn
if someone has like rly rly thin tweezers it might work
FUCK YEAHHH
anyways this is the conclusion of "leo panics about a silica bead being stuck in his USB-A port for almost an hour" session
We need to archive this saga
of the â€œcylinder stuck inside m&ms tubeâ€
but i was actually wondering how it even got in there past the pins
a silica gel packet exploded in my backpack most likely, i didn't notice it, and then i was plugging my mouse in i prob pushed it in
without kyle, leo wouldnâ€™t be going to sleep for hours
i tried playing during quarantine and just rage quit the entire game 2 months later
idk
oh fs
turning on computer rn
Idk if this appeals to anyone but i here is flyer
ive never seen this many autistic people in one setting until i got here
You arenâ€™t beating the light mode allegations Leo
never are never will
WTF DO YOU MEAN
Shit my bad
just so mods don't like pounce you
dont face the same fate as the one who will not be named
Damn this discord shit is serious
I canâ€™t
shikanoko wont hurt you
I donâ€™t think I can understand it
Fr tho

Itâ€™ll die on its own no need to intervene lol
I feel awkward walking in by myself so
I thought that i saw a baby one yesterday but i wasnt sure so i didnt kill it
Kill

except these buttons don't get mad at me when i push them too much!
WTF
hopefully i don't get stabbed when i land
i don't think so unfortunately
how many more hours
apparently you rly have to fuck up as a pilot if your airbus crashes
damn 😭
makes me feel so warm and fuzzy
I WANAN LEARN THIS SO BAD
is it like landing procedures for that specific airport?
there are so many fucking charts
without them we die
that's actually the plane i'm flying 💀
oh. 💀
The fucking wings and engines are a different fucking breed itâ€™s crazy
shame the physics are mediocre
oh really?
each plane dev has to create their own flight model, whereas in other sims stuff like airflow and drag are calculated based on the model of the plane
Anyone here start the PHYS 121 homework
i'm hungry
for such a short timespan
idk
plane
okay i am still very much a beginner
i got it a year ago too but had a long gap between playing and just recently when i picked it up again
fair
I had to build this thing at the refinery since I couldn't fuel it from the dockyard. but now I can, since I have it built.
oh damn wowww
im gonna scream why do i suck at one specific part of thermochem
understanding definiton of heat and work of ALEKs
energy = heat + work
damn
IT's how ALEK's makes it so annoying to understand
it's only this one that's left anyways
oh woww
yeah itâ€™s so much fun. the only problem is that it doesnâ€™t come with big wings or fuselages, but the mk3 expansion fixes that. and the mk4 mod.
if you just want big planes you could also try OPT spaceplanes. but I donâ€™t use that because if you use it with the cryo engines mod it messes things up.
the brain hallucinates shit and some how understands other hallucinations
acutally idk
my brain is like an abyss of bad ideas
Fidalgo was a contract non renewal tho, not fired precisely
Uh oh
Damn 40 min walk
kill
almost back to campus now. rta train from airport.
Im just waiting for the second exam to come back so i know if i did bad or really bad

Donâ€™t tell Alan I put plutonium in his either
so excited, but super scared

I wasnâ€™t actually tbh
i have not been working
bro i just lost 7 credit points
im gonna die
said by the math and cs major
i am so sad

idk how i didnt even use it
Oh mb I'm dumb
i cant do this anymore
not even that much
You have meal swipe wtf
did you work over the past few months or?
it's tldr is a giant game of infection tag on campus over 10 days for anyone who wants to play
I FORGOT WHAT IT's CALLED SHUSH
need i remind you?
I WISH I KNEW I FOUND IT ONLINE 😭😭
I want a cat so badly
Not even close
what is a doma sorry 😭
oh
@mudrocker it is lost forever
The weebification spreads like a fucking disease
There are limits to which blasters are allowed, and you also can't fire a blaster to stun a zombie outside when you're indoors
You are still inside if you are by a window, and you should not be doing dangerous things anyway
people always clown it up with their ideas as if this game hasn't had like 20 years to patch all the insane things you could come up with
"projectiles must be 100% the original projectile" yeah who was trying to kill someone with coin-filled socks I need to know
jesus christ i can only imagine whatâ€™s happened
Tho for next semester am I allowed to modify the blaster noises (perhaps make it so every time I fire it says â€œUwUâ€ to cause mental damage)
Many rules we have that seem silly have come about because of past injuries
i think modified blasters need to be approved
someone please kill my brain for me
Lemme see if Iâ€™m able to solder smtg together over winter break
I can't say whether it'd be approved or not, but that's the correct channel to seek approval
Tru tho itâ€™s just an audio mod and itâ€™s not like silencing the blaster (if anything it prob makes it more noticeable)
Bro your brain already died earlier so hard
I cant sleep
can't think
Thing is if I do these mods anyone who gets hit with it will take mental damage cuz of the cringe
I can't find my melatonin
Go to fucking sleep
I can't
then you have someone being so real
â€œGo the fuck to sleepâ€
I would not choose to be awake right now
what i honestly like to do is think about past memories, moments, and also close your eyes while ur at it, because your memories will become clearer when you close your eyes @mudrocker
Dammit I canâ€™t type the write song out
fair points
Still Alive
Cupid (Twin Version)
why doesn't my Spotify work 😭
oh?
i canâ€™t pick one
aw 🥲🥲🥲
iâ€™m a ride or die cyberpunk fan
rip
Damn he respawned ig
I need my alone time
You had 4 days of alone time??????
clear your head
my roomie was far more present in the room during break 🥲
Oh shit
I thought they left for break my bad

I have nothing against him but I need time I know will never be disturbed
ty tho I will blast the playlist on my way to clac 2 Tomorrow at 825 💀
It may also help to idk be off of discord

iâ€™m 3 hours away from home so iâ€™m not sleeping till 4
im literally gonna sob if I read anything happy or sad rn 😭
my brain won't shut up
Youâ€™re 2 weeks behind on psych notesâ€¦
😭😭😭 FUCK I HAVE CLASS WITH THEM
oh 😭😭😭😭
but that post still felt personal
I just watched someone get zombified
Alan donâ€™t be scared ofc ^_^
Donâ€™t want to say here
I am ready to face my death
DONT LEAVE ME ALONE
You want to be tagged
oh 🥲
and die gloriously
outside aw in a minute if you'd like a hug
Literally everybody in the server is dying 😭
everyone is so damn paranoid 😭
Leo died, donâ€™t go
Just realized if youâ€™re ever stunned as a zombie you can just do your 15 minutes of Duolingo with a boost up
(They would rather kill a child than explain a grammatical rule for some reason)
fair
yeah this is mainly why I strayed away from it
you can never learn a language from only one source
mhm fair
I really want to make a language teaching website with a focus on linguistic rules
OO really?
I don't remember what it was called
i want an app for learning kanji in a very specific way and i fear it does not exist how i want it to
i dont get the anki hype
Omg is Connamacher participating in HvZ
anki didnt help me learn hiragana :pandacry:
i still dont know hiragana
though i didnt use anki to learn kana, for me that was just mnemonics + constant reading and writing
I just realized something
oh
still not enough spinach
Wtf
Idk if youâ€™ve shared this one yet Leo
Rn trying to lock in on physics
Lmao you wouldnâ€™t catch me if you tried /j
Not wrong
fuck i want the den
im too scared though
i wanna last a day
I literally ran from my dorm to the den and the once I got in it was good, if you need help ask humans and they will probably come
😭 i want den so bad but im in the same room as 3 zombies
as you leave the room
no its fine i have snacks in my dorm room im just sad about den
i went to spartique
and lowk wanted pink lemonade
actually makes me wanna cry
😭 😭 😭 if i become a zombie then i can den without fear
Donâ€™t even think about it
genuianly didnt think id make it this far but glee was cancled so
you got tagged? rip
it wasnt my fault someone tagged me while i was napping outside tinkn
i need my eep
i died gloriously
how else was i supposed to tag connamacher
shit really
really
all his students left
no wonder he seemed a bit pissed
totally not cuz uh
i need to
ohh yeah he has a class or something in the room near the lab
im sorry connamacher 😭 😭
someone had to do it
Even still, damn
one of my friends has like 30 tho
Im with alan rn, hes still a human
im in a room with three zombies and i cant get fucking den
i lowkey really want den pancakes
fuck i want pancakes
idk if theyre still there tho
SHIT THEY STILL GOT PANCAKES
FUCK IT IM GETTING PANCAKES
aight im still in cutter rn
alan and alex are nowhere to be seen tho
Donâ€™t
We donâ€™t want the number to go up
do they still have pancakes
Hayley died because of pancakes 😭
I want a report on those pancakes @hellspells
i dont see it on mobile order
But I haven't had good pancakes in so long
I canâ€™t believe theyâ€™d start making pancakes as soon as HvZ starts 😭
What matters is that someone didnâ€™t die
no one died
nope
cuz hvz is causing the den to be a bad idea for many people
I may go to den but with my bandana down cuz I legit cannot chase people anymore
Arda legit just heard me fucking like yelling cuz my leg cramped that hard
Heâ€™d still get stunned
oh does it lose points
His bandana goes down immediately either way
Bro if I do anymore chasing tonight Iâ€™m gonna like show up to my classes crippled tmw and Iâ€™m not going that far lmao
WHAT HAPPENED?
Hayley got caught kekw lmao they spoke too early
My knee hurts and so does my left calf
Nope just out speeding nearly all humans at full speed for running is smtg I havenâ€™t done in years
Aka I havenâ€™t done that sort of intense sprinting since 5th grade when I was doing sports day for Japanese school (yes, that one hyped up episode in all your standard school animeâ€™s lmao)
im thinking of dropping 106 at the end of the year to retake it so that all my chem classes are on seasons again
tho bioc 307 is only offered fall so :GullioShrug:
I mean there are still other classes you can take I presume tho without dropping the credit?
i may not get the A and also heard from other people that off season teachers are a bit worse
fuck yea
Iâ€™m surprised you didnâ€™t mention
The mythical air Mac and cheese
that's just me tripping you and hoping the cheese and mac goes into the air
Chem exam is out
i did almost identically as exam 1
I did worse
I did worse
Guys we canâ€™t let drew Meyer win
omg me too
uh oh
Drew Meyer might not be my glorious king anymore
was it really that bad 😭
looking back, chem111 is not that bad
he never was
i thought chem 106/111 grading was tough till i took math 380 this semester :pandacry: i miss daddy drew
payton fucking pritchard
Have you seen arnav in the last hour or so
He isnâ€™t picking up
He left his id with me so i just want to make sure he doesn't freak out and can get back into his room
iâ€™m e it her extremely sleep deprived
u aint even see him in person 😭
nah of the whole shift from nyc where iâ€™ve lived my entire life to cleveland and college and what not
and i lowkey donâ€™t wanna spend money on getting dorm supplies
And didnâ€™t try and readjust it
i acc fixed my sleep schedule a week before i entered campus and i still fucked it up
I fixed it, and then getting here, itâ€™s either â€œI go to sleep at 1 am or 4 amâ€
chill u can still have a normal sleep schedule 😭
Now that I think about it, I actually do still go to bed 4 am every day
Wtf no
how do u even survive with 3 hours of sleep
sleep 32 out of 48 hours on the weekend
some movies r longer than that 😭
damn does that acc work
i cant sleep for more than 12 hours
when ur that exhausted over 5 days of 3 hours of sleep each
You sleep in on weekends and pray your gf doesnâ€™t hound you for doing that
Also just kinda used to operating on lower amounts of sleep, mainly cuz hs would be me regularly going to sleep past 12am and Iâ€™d have to drive on a highway and be in class by 7:30 am
sometimes it got so bad i got to school during 4th period
6 hours
became so often the teachers started to be like â€œheâ€™s either 30 minutes early or 3 hours lateâ€
At least in college the hours are not necessarily continuous
yeah ur shit was tough 😭
damn isnt there like 20 songs in west side story
Senior year, the most repertoire I had was
- Mendelssohn violin concerto mvt 1
- Bach Partita no 2 movement 1 and 3
- scales (2 three octaves, canâ€™t remember what anymore)
- a whole Rode etude (I think it was like #17)
- 2 more entire etudes for TMEA all state
- excerpts from the eulenspiegel, and some other pieces I canâ€™t remember
Will I ever do it again? If I didnâ€™t have school, yes
Bro hvz is destroying my left leg
I cannot get my left shoe off without pain
The lower half of my body has been a mess for a few years and especially my left
Also arenâ€™t you older than me
BRUV that aint even relevant here
wouldn't want you to trip for the third time
The ones that were tripping me Iâ€™ve had since the pandemic, back when I used to do 3 mile runs every few days in like 35 minutes
still a no... :kermit_frog:
Scared?
i got nothing to prove
Idk
Tho arenâ€™t you a grandma for being older than me
Damn
You could've probably caught me if you decided to run after me, I run slow af
Oh dw
I'm dead!
AKDKDBSKCBDJ WHAT THE FUCK EAS THAT ACTUALL
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPINESS I ONLY KNOW ALIEN STAGE
Fuck u alan
Also new matching pfps just dropped (I'm dying)
:sad:
I procrastinated studying for physics to watch it and regretted everything
Anyways ||can't wait to cry over the bonus round||
Because theyâ€™re alive ||not dead at all (Iâ€™m delusional)||
you know who else died
Man it's scary how visible the phrase "Exam 3" is on the screen
Uh oh
I don't know why I'm talking as if he isn't my favorite character
I am so sorry for this round ||and possibly the next||
istg if ||luka|| is the only one surviving all this someone's gonna die
Hey man alien stage doesn't discriminate everyone suffers
I didn't mean to reply to that
I can't say much about sua though bc i dont really know much about her
oh and fuck luka
Hate him
what the fuck is mayer on today
I canâ€™t take all of this before physics
have you taken the physics test you told me abt yet
I wish I could just have more E&M tbh
Homework is hard, but quizzes and tests are easy to compensate
@kgir06 youâ€™re so lucky rn that I canâ€™t rly chase today
im not leaving anyway
wtf
I donâ€™t blame you lmao
I fell asleep like halfway thru
It wasn't awesome unfortunately
damn
An upperclassman can correct me if im wrong but you withdrawl from the class and it will show a W on SIS, and then at the end of the semester any course with a W on your transcript will be removed from your transcript. Also the minimum is 12 credits

You shouldnâ€™t risk things
(Itâ€™s not that bad trust me lmao)
Iâ€™ll have it checked on if it doesnâ€™t seem to recover
Which isnâ€™t a tube
I hate when I have a cylinder stuck in a tube
no it can't be cut open lmao
I DIDN'T SAY SHIT LMAO
bored
(it's too late at night I can't think straight)
Suffocation seems unpleasant
I mean I can ask even worse questions if you'd like
and â€œobjects are technically dead so why careâ€
oh
@casasdefender what's your opinion about slew mode in microsoft flight sim
Don't really have one honestly
Iâ€™m sorry??
Would kill you
That face canâ€™t be trusted
Always smiling after getting away with a war crime
Ugh
Well i guess my main is NOT getting in this server 💯
Nope :( I'm only in like 15
@leowhygamma idk man i'm getting pretty good at this this whole "aviation photography" thing
wtf
He also got himself banned off of the theta chi server after pinging random people too (after I told him he shouldnâ€™t do that if he wants a change to even be considered for being unbanned)
I have not seen him since until like today in person either after that incident Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Wtf
There were other straws broken?
Alanâ€™s never cooked before lmao
wtf
i dont think i even want to try it
Iâ€™m eating it itâ€™s not bad
It needed sugar to rly fix it tho ;-;
You now know what I look like (tho you could follow my insta if you want lmao @leona_yamauchi)
went on a target trip with friends yesterday and played infinite craft for like 5 hours on friday
It was tho
I won't be too descriptive because most of this happened on a platform I'm not on
This (I donâ€™t feel like pinging Ben by accident so
Damn thatâ€™s a lot worse
His last name does Not start with a Y i don't know why ben called him simon y
mmmmm close enough
oh
need to get out of house
holy fuck where?!?!?!
Idk
Arnav was at least much funnier on discord than Simon. 

Like yeah he took it too far and it was probably for the best he got banned but he was memeing it up. 

Simon just went on tons of rants in the class of '27 discord about how good US imperialism is and how California is scary and bad because all the crime and then he said some transphobic stuff and then they finally banned him
I bet he isnâ€™t from New York either
LMFAO HE DIDNT SHOW UP TO THE CHEM 111 FINAL LAST FALL :kekcry:
if it's the simon I'm thinking of I did see him at the airport coming back from fall break lmao
Some history is left to be forgotten for a reason
Just get a job at the egg factory instead smh
and does the duration of each chord have to last the same amt of measures?
I donâ€™t think so
great I hate music
And nope
Also weird mental thoughts running thru my head forcing me awake
He brought up the holocaust to support his argument for US imperialism now, basically his point was because we were the good guys in WWII we must also have been the good guys in every war since then. The US military can do no wrong, because to criticize them would be to take the opposing stance, so therefore we should continue to bomb and coup random counties as much as we want

But I really don't want to rehash it all too much, it's really not my place and I think he has at least gotten quieter, if not a bit more nuanced, about his views.
wtf
i hate this class
I need to do that T-T
And Jonah next to me plays games the whole damn time
Iâ€™m a bit sick. the only reason Iâ€™m here is because I couldnâ€™t be bothered to do whatever I need to do to get an allowed absence.
actually cannot deal w drew meyer any longer
i have some if u need it
i feel like iâ€™m gonna. have to chop my ankles off
Achilles when he feeling like he wants to go to the other side be like
Rave is extra credit for math
Ouch 😅
wait why tf did I just waste hours trying to get python to work for this physics assignment when I don't know how to plot figures in python and I can just use matlab
How do you manage a python? Seems scary
Nah, just control theur head and make sure they don't ever get fully wrapped around you without someone there to help
Itâ€™ll work, trust
Where can we find this python
Maybe don't
I don't think the heat would be enough to catalyze the reaction to where it would turn to water before it hurt you
Also they wouldn't really be able to mix in the intestines well I think
Probably exo I guess water is more favored
still water
Death, as I doubt your mouth has enough conditions for them to react plus hydrogen gas is very flammable and will combust. So please donâ€™t
*fucking shatters it*
they're gonna be like 
therapisy: "how are you feeling" 
me: "fine"
therapist: "are you coping"
tho all jokes aside i kinda need to cuz uhhh let's just say my emotional response to people and reading people has never been wrose
i j havent had the motivation to actually schedule a meeting
which probably says smth
another thing im worried abt is the therapists here
bc at my hs the counseling services were really shit
if they seem bad, defeat them (idk
We just need to do my health portal
Assuming a semester is 16 weeks every other is 8 times 2 is 16 and assuming we maybe a skip a session cause of a break or something
Idk how Iâ€™d feel about a group session
i'm not doing group sessions tho if i'm being honest
I donâ€™t need my personal feelings to be public
i need to sleep on this tbh
Fair, I honestly wouldnâ€™t be up to it also
cuz itâ€™s scheduling for same day and im not mentally prepared for that
Iâ€™m gonna decide on Thursday cause thatâ€™s my next empty day
I donâ€™t really do that
tho my more accurate problem is that i'm prob so stressed and mentally exhausted outside of the chaotic husk i have is quite lonely mentally lol
Why does it say not satisfied in top left by satisified on the screen?
ive tried therapy and i end up j sitting there not knowing how to start
What do you mean by mentally lonely?
2.5 hours
but yeah no it's also cuz i'm way too damn busy lmao
my mind jumps from old people -> dead people a little too quickly sometimes
never trust post 9pm thoughts
my pre 9 pm thoughts are usually useless so idk
we were like. can they survive without food or water? do zombies burn calories? can they sweat?
well, they commonly subsist on brains. so they require some energy. but mainly theyâ€™re held together by necromantic energy and therefore donâ€™t need food or water.
last of us zombies
College student lifestyle
idk
we stupid lmao
thatâ€™s a fair excuse
iâ€™m just bored so iâ€™m up
homework id assume?
homework is done for the day
nope just so i don't look stupid in rehearsal when i do the wrong bowings
after I wasted a while installing python software that I didnâ€™t need
Having bowings seems so annoying to me
makes me feel so productive
left it at home tho, didnt bring it w me
Oh Iâ€™m so sorry for you Kaavya
jonah doesn't act like a trumpet player
yall are supposed to marvel at my awesomeness
my migraines been really frickin bad lately
its gotten to the point where taking the max amt of tylenol my body can handle doesnt help
i j need sleep
i think every single one of you needs sleep
literally slept 15 hrs the other day
you just don't
i need that so bad
went to bed at 7:30 pm woke up around noon
fuck i need to sleep like that
i think all my problems would be gone if i got 15 hours of sleep
thats doubtful considering the amt of hw i had to do cuz i didnt do it the night before
Bro chose the WORST brass instrument
and slept for 15 hours
id have no problems 😭
i don't respect trombone and trumpet players  /j
I canâ€™tâ€¦
bad french horns are muddy
but i have NO MONEY
bad french horns sound like death
bad french horn example
I feel so called out rn 😭
since like 5 pm i havent gotten out of bed
ive taken two naps
ngl i was so sleepy once that i woke up 3 days later with my phone dead, alarm clock thrown across the room, pillow EXTRAORDINARILY warm, my left leg hanging off the bed, my arms both somehow twisted behind my back, my eyes crusted around, and my head not being able to compute jack shit
wtf
it was after a week of tests so they were like â€œi think he needs to rest a *bit* moreâ€
I hate my bed because I end up doing nothing for at least 3 hours if I get in it
i mean my worst ever sleep decision was when i woke up at 7am and went to sleep at 6am the next day lmao
and that bit turned into 3 days
damn
bad no all nighters r not good
bro i had no damn idea exactly how i slept that much
my parents wouldve thought i was dead 😭
the ungodly feeling after a 3 day sleep
my parents thought i was dead after the day of sleeping for 15
when i get there in january and you donâ€™t hear a single peep from my room
consider me dead or in a coma
consider fucking up your sleep schedule even more
damn shes alive
Join the bad sleep schedule people 😈
and thatâ€™s a feather you shouldnâ€™t trust
no go to sleep
i will absolutely enable bad idea
I must sleep the Calc 3 wants me to stay awake
i stopped my music to hear this wtf
damn
idk anything else about him
You canâ€™t even see his eyes here
omg zhong li too

Need to get rabies shot
Do you think you can help me tag someone Leo?
i have class at 8:25
He needs to get back to Clarke
i'm tired and need sleep
ask someone else sorry lol
Guess Iâ€™m on my own then
Forgot about him
just watched someone die
i read this without reading the following messages :omg:
So someone got tagged because their blaster misfired and their darts only flew a few inches
i mean like if you actually did atch someone die you are not reporting that to the case class of 2028 server first
Unfortunately when you use that sort of vocabulary it only takes one person to cause a panic, so it's important to be careful in the way we talk about things to make sure we are clear that this is a game being played
i wish i could sleep until noon, i have so many morning classes
see now you made lindsey sad
Tham how did you find this
Well I have a friend in year level who told me  about 28 server and Iâ€™m new to discord and social media in general hell my insta is like less than 3 months old
that too (probably, i just work here)
Guys we may be introducing too much internet slang
Culturally Iâ€™m a boomer due to picking up most things from my grandparents
oh we're hunting leo?
im friends with leo what do you need me to do
Why are you coming in January arenâ€™t you already a student in CWRU
He is currently screaming in pain in our dm
Fair nuf
Oh well he was sending sad and crying gif to me like 3-4 times last night after I showed him something that you guys shouldnâ€™t find out as I donâ€™t want to be mauled by my classmates
oh what the antichrist
An no it wasnâ€™t bullying, it was tears of envy
Thatâ€™s all you need to know and yes weâ€™re still friends
i havent the faintest clue

Nope, just kinda learned that thru random Wikipedia scrolling
Also damn loaded mashed potato bowl today at leutner

Idk, Billy got the tag
i hope his name isnt a day of the week-
I look forward to finding out whatever happened to him between the end of Penacony and the next part
that emoji looks super wrong
i dont play
nope
Whatâ€™s the theme of this chat then as I see it keeps changing
I think we need discipline, order, and organization
We need a box to think in, no outside the box things need to be ordered, clean, structured, pristine, and mechanical
Im sorry but i canâ€™t read Chinese
ermmmm you *should* be able to get in with your id card
but i heard someone else was also having issues getting in last week
Does anyone one know of the math department here has a feud with English department as in my highschool there was a massive feud and itâ€™s fun to watch

there's nothing demon core level but some mildly radioactive stuff
Stupid little me
yeah I would hope case didnâ€™t have a literal fissile core for a nuclear bomb just lying around
isnâ€™t obtaining one of those literally the plot of a mission impossible movie or something
When the demon core halves got closed for a few seconds, it gave everyone in that room radiation sickness and they all ended up dying??
your cells will simply stop reproducing (very bad)
your gut microbes will die (very bad)
your stem cells you fucking STOP
is this a joke or is this serious
because if its serious i need you to take me there alan
I think we need to build a lot of mineshafts
we can't let the soviets widen the mineshaft gap
did you test this cause it doesnt work 😭
Nope
Fair point
Then what is the mineshaft someone mentioned when I talked about cobalt bombs
idk 😭
Nope
I donâ€™t get it
@reefrider have you used stellic to plan your courses yet?
I do want to know this
bad timing
didnt stun him quick enough
im not too mad abt it
oh nah
nope
Apparently I name my cats after beverages (technically my grandparents cats now) I named them Milo (due to white and brown like Milo) coffee (pure brown) and ice tea due to orange and white, is it normal
world full of pain
math 122
Oh you didnt use stellic
OMG IT'S MILO
nah i only realized AFTER i went thru SIS
thatâ€™s just my assumption though
2 humanities, 2 social sci, 2 in either. relatively trivial to knock out the perspectives and communication intensives within those (barring local+global engage but that should get easier with time bc uger is still new)
its like not that hard
rlgn 101 gets you a humanity and the 3 non local+global engage perspectives. ecopsych (pysch 377 i think?) gets you the last perspective plus a semester non movement wellness
and then slotting 2 cis in there isnt hard
Astronomy is the study of space
if that was possible i dont think case, a stem school, would even offer it
i tried searching up â€œgl animeâ€ on gifs
would be a banger religion class tbh
Oh dear
im sorry 😭
it dont exit
i wanted to use my dosimeter :(
But isnâ€™t astronomy a pseudoscience as everyone knows the sun revolves are the earth, Pluto is a planet, and that the earth is flat
I donâ€™t make noise when I sleep unless Iâ€™m having nightmares or night terrors
Is that dog food?
Please tell me they donâ€™t feed us that
the collective â€œfribley soupâ€ says more than enough about this school
If we look at earth from like a rly far away distance the distance between Leutner and fribley is inconsequential
they donâ€™t 😭
mercury is in gatorade rn though 😔
itâ€™s just a bucket that people load shit into iâ€™d assume
Hey donâ€™t talk shit about the elixir of immortality according to ancient China

(That doesnâ€™t even fucking make sense lmao)
Now my eyes hurt
sorry chat
What about telling your parents you want to be a ronin neet
Yeah explains why I feel like I want to flip tables every now and then lol
Cuz they donâ€™t need unemployed children
You need excercise
i need to fix my life
2nd amendment is fine donâ€™t need martial arts this isnâ€™t the boxer rebellion
Cuz I could teach it legitimately
damn
i never knew
damn??
tho I never got my certificate from Korea saying Iâ€™m a 3rd degree so in their books Iâ€™m still a second degree
yeahhh i quit a long while ago but i was 3rd dan and could technically go back for more
i got mine
Prob cuz my grandmaster never processed the forms
Iâ€™ve just ended up trying kendo here instead now tho and I want to see if I can get to first degree for that
you dont use saya in kendo
its a lot of work though
not sure if we have a hema club still tho
I just want to try multiple SEA martial arts too
i wanted to join a martial arts club idk which
Pretty sure my parents wonâ€™t go berserk if I join it
My Asian parents arenâ€™t strict tbh but I wish there was a taekwondo or karate club since kendo was eh during club rush
but settled for head in lap with earbuds in but still somehow listening to butler
i cant w him
rip
i gave it up tho, it was planned
did it really? we tried to make it as natural as possible
idk
That would explain why i never see a human here
what just happened
That I forgot to do and was due 3 hours ago 💀
I FORGOT OKAY SHUSH LMAO
Bro is never locked in
imagine not doing your work on time
couldn't be me
What were you doing during your shift yesterday in the music hall if it wasnt your music work
Rip
I have math hw due tmw

Stellic broke
204 credits is near quad degree, in a semester...
Why dont you do it then
Damn
Iâ€™m potentially doing 18 to 21 credits next semester, I canâ€™t wait to die
My currect idea is 25 credits, but I don't think ym advisor will let me do that :/
It's my stupid aiqs
i won't be
0*10 is still 0
Having time for yourself is valuable and you can still be academically accomplished and productive towards your major/academic goals without working yourself to death
Yeah I agree with this. I feel like Iâ€™m dying lowkey rn lol 🙃🙃
what if I really want to do the classes tho
Donâ€™t if you donâ€™t have to
Entire calc hw plus like half of my chem hw left, and I submitted my music theory work late and havenâ€™t started my physics hw yet, while still having a quiz on a topic I barely understand in calc :/
aw no 😭😭
I am exhausted already
Like a beat up 1990 corolla with a broken engine 🙃
Yes, I hate tea
okay eyropean tea isn't the greatest
asian teas tho
if you hate those you're kinda a heretic
oh lmaooo
Watch the clip yet?
not yet
100 yen tea is smtg i miss
i miss the konbini's, they're cheap and the quality is so good
and idk if my scholarship covers it??
tho for you it'd be like a literal island hop away lmao
could be wrong
Question, but no offense what makes Japan appealing as I just read about the possible future massive apocalyptic earth quake and I donâ€™t want to be there when it happens so I want to minimize my presence in Japan as much as possible
I donâ€™t get
i'm japanese, and i've been wanting to go back their to learn more about my own culture (cuz i rejected it for the longest time). Also cuz for me, TSMC is coming to japan, and also cuz i want to learn more about my own family and it's history, along with the arts it provides (both anime/weeb kind and traditional ones, especially music and martial arts)
im poking fun at internet's fascination of japan, even though i am literally the same
i have a fascination that isn't just "oh im a weeb" lmao. I quite literally have family there, and i kinda wanna know about why i have this personality i have as is, which from what little i've heard involves quite a lot of family drama apparently
for most of the internet, itâ€™s for â€œanimeâ€ and â€œcultureâ€, some people have different and similar reasons

while i am brown, i do have some japanese heritage and i wanna go meet some of my relatives for the first time, im also a photographer and i wanna go during either the spring or winter time to be able to take photos of some of the places there, i also want to go because ive never been abroad and i wanna explore the place on my own while observing their differences in infrastructure
oh my days that might just be fucking wild
slow burn of being a social reject in america for being asian (the people who grew up in a p white neighborhood as a ethnic minority kid would prob get it), then learning the fact japan treats people poorly, then getting absolutely snobbed on and dissed by the weebs at school made me hate being japanese and knowing japanese at all
i've begun undoing it like in just the past few years for that kinda self-loathing tho
Also Iâ€™ve been to many cities in Japan before and I wouldnâ€™t recommend it due to the xenophobia I experienced more than in the US, the people there are cold and not friendly (kill joys) as they expect things to fit the norm and canâ€™t be loud canâ€™t stand out all has to fit the community stereotypes, my other Japanese friends agree with me on some of this too (I went to an international school ), while the culture is alright I prefer other countries more
Also Japan has social norms that other culture donâ€™t which makes adapting there very hard and their indirectness is also a challenge to deal with
I got talked to in english in japan despite being japanese cuz i don't act japanese
Also my friends told me that even if you learn Japanese and stayed there for long you will still be an outsider
tho things are slowly changing imo, mainly cuz that sort of exclusivity is the reason why japan's fallen behind economically and socially (especially their population, which if you've ever seen their pyramid is... crazy)
and is still going down
I also hate Japanese work culture them most too as they expect everyone to work overtime, the. Go out drinking with the boss (I hate drinking and my liver canâ€™t process alcohol due to genetic issue), tons of expectations and more work even though youâ€™re sick, inhumane work conditions and black companies (look it up itâ€™s like a sweat shop term in Japan)
yeah that's true. Still doesn't change my want to visit my family and still try to understand myself better
plus learning i have a cousin (and 2 of them no less) like 5 months ago is still smtg that doesn't fully make sense to me, but at the same time makes me want to learn more about my family cuz i've always been a younger sibling too so
Now Iâ€™m confused and donâ€™t want to imagine how big your family tree must be
trust me you dont
Shouldnâ€™t this go in #promos ?
nope, no advertising/selling should be on this server in general
also $400 a week assuming working 5 days a week is $80 per day, which means up to almost 10 hours of work per day, which i don't get why'd they send that to full time college students either lmao
Well that's part of the scam. It's an implausibly large amount of money for an implausibly small amount of work 

It's just praying on desperate people. 

I don't know if their goal is money (if they'll contrive some reason why you need to pay them before they can pay you) or free labor doing menial computer tasks for things like AI training (and then they disappear after the work is done without paying) or just personal information to harvest. 

But I will bet money that they have never paid anyone anything. 

You see posts like it from discord spam bots, as well as similar things in increasing frequency on sites like Facebook marketplace.
Where do you come from where an hour of work is $8???
on one hand thatâ€™s so many places I didnâ€™t know I could use case cash with that Iâ€™ve been spending real money on. on the other hand, Iâ€™d run out of case cash at some point.
tbh i havent tried 3/4 of these places
case took all my meal plan casecash last semester to pay for my lost id :kekcry:
rip
tbh idk :duckyidk: i just remember using my case card lol because i didnt have a credit card back then
Wrong server?
They charge you end of term
Cuz itâ€™s an open invite server
Anyone can get in if they tried enough random character combinations
You can get in without needing to be invited
Some guy saying you could earn $400 a week for way too much work imo
Last I checked even fast food gave more than twice that rate
I don't think the scammer specified how much work. I think you came up with that it was 5 days a week, 10 hours a day
They were probably trying to make it sound like an easy job
I based it off of ohios minimum wage, working 5 days a week (which google told me is 10.45 per hour in 2024 so)
Iâ€™ve seen how receptionist jobs can be, and they seemâ€¦ terribly stressful
I just realized this is drunk math lmao
What is drunk math
Math done wrong
Question about he who should not be named, I scrolled though thread and saw thoseâ€¦â€¦. Abomination of a fanfic I needed bleach why is he obsessed with Mayerâ€¦.. this is worst than the time in middle school a math teacher had his students started a cult worshiping himâ€¦â€¦.
He didnâ€™t write that for one
I lowkey feel thereâ€™s always at least one teacher whose worshipped like for no other reason than shits and giggles
Was the one he wrote much worst
I donâ€™t believe he wrote any himself
He isnâ€™t that insane
Not really at all
Not banned at all tho most people donâ€™t rly bring it up asides from making references when doing anything mildly suspicious
Weâ€™re exaggerating how bad his actions were
Relatively speaking it wasnâ€™t that bad, just really unhinged to the point of discomfort
Oh I thought he did something very very very very very bad
Not too bad
Although he did go too far
Also @katsukurry_32009 how does computer science work with premed?
You have a fair bit more coursework to do, since not all of it aligns well with the premed track
Well I canâ€™t even code and for tech support I just pray and beg my commuter to work
There's def people who are able to do a BS and Premed tho
It made me sad
No but I didnâ€™t expect it to be that bad
Itâ€™s very sad but serves its purpose
Why donâ€™t you like fujisan
Why hate taco
Why do you hate funisan
The rice just makes me sad, and I canâ€™t get any actual fish thru it
I donâ€™t care about imitation crab
Plus as someone who has a very strong memory of good Japanese sushi, it makes me very very sad
Is Fujisan the one near the Subway?
Mods can we banish tham for his objectively wrong opinion/hj
I haven't eaten at Fujisan but that just sounds outright insane
i haven't had current meltU, but last semester i gave something from there a shot and it was so bad i never tried it again
Melt U is among the best swipes on campus and I will die on that hill
It doesnâ€™t mean freedom from consequences lmao
i remember the first few times i had leutner late night, the meatball sandwich was legit the most delicious thing ive ever had in my whole life, and then suddenly it became dogshit idk why, then i never had it again
Do they still sell that one melt with mushrooms by chance?
I wish
I think Fribley late night has grilled cheese with mushrooms though
But you need money for that no?
IDK isnâ€™t it normal to have 80% of non CWRU meals be DoorDash
Melt u is swipes, whatever that is isnâ€™t
Never used door dash here
I donâ€™t always go to case cash places tbh
thats so much wtf
@mism0937 @katsukurry_32009 i would never actually use the whole speedometer, not trying to commit a felony.......

unless....
I feel like this is some reference I'm not understanding
it isnt 😭
Oh 😭
Yeah like bro you're not even in college yet chill out (but also don't commit crimes when you get here nonetheless)
I have like 170 of it left and the term is near the end so I have to burn it
I am on a diet so no I donâ€™t eat that much and using 4 meal swipe a day to be profitable is hard already
Iâ€™m not saying you need to eat a lot, Iâ€™m just saying thereâ€™s no reason to use real money if youâ€™re already paying for meal plan
there's a mental component cause for me at least, especially around finals season, having the same food every day gets really exhausting and the idea of a Little Treatâ„¢ï¸ is very enticing
I guess I just personally donâ€™t like the idea of spending money I donâ€™t need to
Also can you explain to Tham why his opinion about fujisan being better than authentic Japanese sushi is OBJECTIVELY wrong
I feel youâ€™d be able to speak on that more than I can
oh it sucks to spend money but also sometimes its worth it for the way I personally prefer to live and the means I have for myself
wtf
if NOTHING ELSE, frozen sushi sucks
Cold sushi is nice
wtf
Fujisan rice is cold, bland, and kinda too hard. Not to mention thereâ€™s no distinct stickiness that Japanese sushi rice does. It doesnâ€™t have fucking fish in it either (itâ€™s imitation crab dammit and those suck if thatâ€™s your â€œdefinitionâ€ of sushi)
I love cold sushi
sorry leo I can't argue with this monster
Sushi shouldnâ€™t be cold cold
Fair
Rice is served best when cold
Tham is starting a fucking war on this server with his wrong opinions
Idk I'm kinda socially awkward and stuck with the people I already knew instead of socializing with other people lol
he either (a) knows this and is trolling or (b) has the taste buds of an Nebraskan octogenarian and thinks soy sauce is Too Spicy or (c) doesn't like sushi in general, which makes his comparison less interesting for those of us who are interested in comparing fujisan to sushi. i'm guessing (a)
I infect have spent 15usd on a single premium tuna nigiri
Oh lord
Goodbye Jake
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. All wrong
What would your opinion happen to be on Fujisan sushi versus sushi in Japan?
i have never had sushi in japan
Most of the sushi place in Japan isnâ€™t newly cleaned except sushiro, most of itâ€™s a bit old and a family shop
personally I love whatever sushi has the most complex taste. I keep kosher so I'm unfortunately limited to only the options that have fish, and no other forms of seafood. but that's plenty for me.
I did a few times. not consistently though.
We polling this shit
I have had California rolls so much at college that I no longer like them
Itâ€™s old and rundown to some extent itâ€™s not new or clean
Theyâ€™re clean tho??? Idk what youâ€™re on about?
It doesnâ€™t have to be new or crystal clean to be good?
No my point is that those serve on plastic plate and isnâ€™t fancy yet people overhyped it when itâ€™s has the same value as fujisan (not the first class sushi premium fancy places) an average sushi shop will have cheap plastic things yet people here treat it like itâ€™s better than fujisan when both are of equal value and presentation
Iâ€™ve literally never been to a restaurant in Japan that served it on plastic plates unless it was meant to be like a food stall
Dammit fuck
idk I'm just trying to finish my lap report
This feels like cherrypicking
i havenâ€™t flown on a non american airline
I've got two hours left I'm fiiiiiiiiiine

Still missing this airport food tho
So damn good and so cheap too
Idk if they still do that tho
i want to travel outside of north america at some point
Now I want to go to Japan again ;-; I'm so hungry
Apparently I went to a â€œThaiâ€ place and they claim sushi is Thai food
We never heard Thamâ€™s counter argument
I miss my old phone which has pictures of more food
Damn
I just realized my brain didnâ€™t even do the calculations
WHAT THE FUCK
Shouldnâ€™t have trusted

eye opening information
You can chase Leo tho
alright die
CWRU dorm are worst I saw it as a guest and Iâ€™m shock at the inhuman living conditions so cramped
i havent the faintest clue
ik some of my friends are worse off than i am
No it isnâ€™t
Weren't the CWRU dorms ranked 8th worst on some Tiktok?
dorms are actually livable. bathrooms are atrocious. lack of ac is the worst part of the rooms themselves.
i dont trust tiktok as a valid source of info
it's not awful, and there can certainly be worse
I meant it's not luxurious but it's not awful
WE ARENT LAST WOOOOO
I don't either it's just funny to me
Fr the bathrooms are atrocious sometimes but that's cuz some people have no sense of cleanliness for some reason
2 bathrooms on taft 4th floor just dont work
Well Leo we both know why and Iâ€™m not telling them why as I donâ€™t want to get mauled
last week my shower wouldn't drain
i slept on the floor multiple times at home, that should give you a reference for how tired i can get
on our floor people just don't flush for some reason...
Oh man that's awful
oh yeah once our shower didn't drain and they had to seal it off cuz stuff started growing in it lol
idk, i somehow do it
Hey canâ€™t you have your own rooms and bathrooms
nothing has happened
Nothing too fancy
i HATE twin beds
Oh the geese are evil
oh nyo
Damn that's pretty fancy
i can still get into juni dorms alan i will show up in your room

I hate nursing
Love nurses wouldnâ€™t be a nurse tho
Not really, I said I hate nursing as a major
short
No I hate nursing in regards to the content
short is commonly used
Like a shrimp, small and with bad posture
Omg that's what I've heard people call 5'8" kpop idols I feel so tall now
Reason is due to manpower shortage in the medical field
@katsukurry_32009 do you need a booster seat when driving /j
i mean you are short
short
IM SORRY
buying clothes is so hard
i cant speak
oh no why?
damn how tall??
holy shit
Wtf
Why couldnâ€™t god give me that growth spurt
Smh I never get the tall genes
Clarisse isn't that short 🥲
i can carry her to class if i have to
My mom gave me the short genes 😭
One litteraly in UH messed up the writing and got the wrong guy sent to kidney transplant surgery due to messing up the paper work, thankfully the kidney was a match or else the patient could have died
Bro I have family friends who are also filipino-chinese and they're probably like a foot taller than me, in high school too like wtf
Holy shit
Another in UH didnâ€™t record patient blood test so gave the wrong meds and died
Why didnâ€™t I get my dads genes😭
Well consider this. Hospitals are understaffed, and fail to provide the proper support for nurses. Nurses face the largest amount of violence a day. More than police do. While this isn't an excuse for malpractice, nurses are tired. But also remember that nurses care. We care so fucking much. And when you find yourself in the hospital, they are going to care. They are going to be tired and they will try to care. And when they stop caring know that it is not their fault but the fault of the system.
Apparently Kyle is too
I have enough horror stories to last a life time thankyou
Feels like confirmation bias
Ngl I kinda want to hear more horror stories but also does this count as a HIPPA violation
I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience but me. I'm going to be better. A lot of student nurses try to be better
as long as it doesn't mention the patient or it's been publicized i'm guessing no?
the reason why people find airplanes more scary is this tbh
More people die in car crashes
Exactly. Just because you've experienced a bad doctor or nurse does not mean all are bad
But still all people hear about on the news and stuff in the airplane crashes
Iâ€™m short af
literally it requires so many layers of errors to even start having problems in airplanes, let alone full on crashes with planes
So it's like a "see? It's bad because that's what's being reported"
my back would not stop bleeding during quarantine
I also have stretch marks but idk why
There is also one time where a nurse was treating patients with wrong medicine and a doctor had to step up and shut that mess down before issues can even be brought ( in Asia )
No Iâ€™m feeling evil rn
In terms of nursing the US is one of few countries that gives nurses the freedom to do what they need to do
Look man, just because you had a bad experience doesn't mean that all of them suck. And the wider issue here is that THE SYSTEM IS FUCKED UP
If someone does these hands can heal and hurt
however when i went to a different  hospital for emergency surgery
it really depends on environment
And arenâ€™t acknowledged as much as doctors r
yeah and i hate when doctors are mean to nurses
be the nurse that made sure i didnt pass out before my parents came to the hospital right before my surgery
A doctor would not be able to do half the things they can with out a nurse
Mostly due ti annoyance due to incompetence and disagreements
Like I get that doctors go through a lot cause of residency and shit but itâ€™s not a reason to be mean to nurses
IT MEANS TAKE A BREAK AND STEP AWAY
That doesnâ€™t mean the role of nurses is unimportant or lesser
Exactly, like okay I get that the coordinators and nurses and anesthesiologists and etc. are not working on the level you want them to but also like they are doing their best to support you and you can't do their work without them setting the ORs and stuff
I don't care if you think that a doctor does more, nurses also do so much
I think you may be missing the point 😭
Ok back to my original point of why I donâ€™t like nursing as a major for me,
i dont think lear focuses on the patient
YOU WOULD BE A TERRIBLE DOCTOR IF YOU HATE ON NURSES
WORK AS A CNA
spread love and joy!!! don't hate on nurses!!!!!
GET EXPERIENCE IN A HOSPITAL
Shit I want to work as a cna or an ma
I need to get the clinical experience 😭
idk
Bc like rn I'm not doing shit
Some are, some havenâ€™t (including me)
Oh
Fuck
I need to start volunteering at CC 😭
Bro is trying to redeem his MA license already
Why I donâ€™t like nursing as a major.

1. Less pay than doctors but more work
2. There is a shortage on doctors hence nurses now get assigned more responsibility 
3. Can do more good and fill the doctor shortage by being a doctor than nurse 
3. Med students donâ€™t want to enter some fields like nephrology leading to actual shortage on doctors in that fields hence if one becomes a doctor to help with the shortage more lives are saved
Aaa I want research so bad (not as a job tho)
I DONT CARE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HATE ON ME
ALSO PREMED IS SHIT
Isn't there supposed to be an increasing shortage in like, doctors, nurses, and maybe physician assistants too?
BECAUSE PEOPLE DONT RESPECT NURSES
I feel half these points are more for arguing why doctors are valuable
you need both to treat a patient you know??? 😭😭😭
If thereâ€™s a shortage for doctors why is it so hard to get into med school 😭
And not why nursing as a major is bad
I being logic and stats not emotion, Iâ€™m trying to be civilized here
and that is where you lose
I want to get into med school so bad
No itâ€™s more of the work load thing plus money overall
i would say that's an awful way to think about work...
fujisan sushi good, nurses bad
If I get into med school I'm going to put everything into opthalmology, idk about other surgeries, especially neurosurgery
What medical area do u want to specialise in
Iâ€™ve seen the inside of the industry since I was a kid and yes you also have to think about the work load and your own mental health too
i want to see
Opthalmology, ngl it still kinda freaks me out because I saw some surgery (I don't think I was supposed to but welp what can you do if it's literally visible on a TV screen)
Honestly that's good though!! Ngl I can't tell if I'm dead-locked on the path I'm on rn because I still haven't looked around and am possibly scared to
and i am fucking tweaking because you are missing my point here. My point is that they are equally important roles in the medical field and both are needed. You can't have one without the other. I don't care that you are busy thinking about the money, I am busy thinking about THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE ALWAYS COME FIRST. And that is also where You would not make it as a good doctor. No matter how good you get at procedures. No matter how smart you are. You Will Never Be A Good Doctor, A Kind Doctor. Not with your current attitude towards nurses. I've seen your type. The people that see blue collar jobs as less than. the type too look down on janitors and food service. And you need to understand that money does not matter in the end. Every role serves a purpose
ive NEVER done dissections
oh i hundred percent get that
agreed! and this falls far outside of just nurses and doctors, but for nearly every profession that deals with another closely related one
did you see cleveland clinic is expanding their Cole Eye building?
Try buying a pigs organ and dissect it first then, as thatâ€™s what confirm my path to medicine as in biology class I dissected it as the teacher instructed in HS and didnâ€™t revolted by the stench or touch or feeling of it like others
no you dont get to ignore what i just said
But omg they are building so fast
I honestly want to major in cs or ds cause bio is kinda boring
ikr :omg: just drove past it today man its...its big
Man I should've done the pig eye harvesting
You can't hate on what I have decided to make my livelihood, on what HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS HAVE DECIDED TO DO WITH THEIR LIFE AND GET AWAY WITH IT
I WILL FIND YOU
Oh ig that makes sense, the lab I used to work at used them for RPE
I have no idea how we even got here, as I remebered you recommended nursing to someone undecided and I said not, I have given my reasons why I donâ€™t recommend it as a major
We need more nurses tho
Violence is not the answer im trying to have a civil debate
real, i like to think that in another world i would be working towards being a physical therapist instead of cs major
and your input is shit in my opinion.Your only basis for hating on nursing as a major is because you personally have decided that you don't like nursing
idk sounded a lot to me like you were saying nurses cause most medical malpractice
you can still do that :3
and people shouldn't be nurses because they don't do as much good
Why donâ€™t u want to 😭
Im not saying you shouldnâ€™t be but the work load is a concern
I am simply giving a suggestion to reef about a potential major as they are undecided and starting in the spring, It is much more difficult to switch into the nursing program at case than it is to leave it
if this cs thing doesnt work out i know what to do lol
You can be devil's advocate without being a jerk to a whole career
cuz i also really like cs 💀
Fair enough also Iâ€™m not the one using profanities
Everyone is working hard, just because you have decided that this work is not for you does not give you the right to hate on it
chat i dont think i shouldve brought up the fact im undeclared
Sure but that doesnâ€™t mean we have to degrade down to using profanities
Itâ€™s worse than mechanics
isnt cs a dying major
You are inherently wrong about how you think about nurses vs docotrs
homeless together is funner than homeless alone
E &M problems r the worst
(i would consider it, but its just a little scary)
REEF STOP IT DON'T MAKE ME CONSIDER A BIO MAJOR /j
Hears how I understand things, I started off saying not to do nursing and she went on a tangent about how I hate nurses then I said yes I do hate most of them there are goods one then list anecdotes of why I donâ€™t like them. And yes here is where we are now from how they see things
> then I said yes I do hate most of them
💀
GO TO SLEEP 😭😭😭
Good sir the reason I went off at you is because you WERE hating on nursing. You were essentially calling them less than and repeatedly stated how they are worse than doctors
I hated chem in high school, then took physics fell in love, so I went to engineering cause it was applied, then I settled on mechanical engineering because itâ€™s the most broad and opens the most doors career wise
Nah why do u want to take the 8 30 am math lecture 😭
If you hate most nurses then I don't think premed is for you genuinely.
THAT DOESNT CONFLICT
nah tbh w cs you need to have a domain
cs in and of itself... aint no way you're finding a job :omg: 
thats why i'm doing medicine, otherwise i'd have just gone to cmu and become a corporate slave for google or some shit
Damn thatâ€™s just sad 😭
idk was your medical malpractice caused by a nurse. what exactly happened. how does your specific nurse-adjacent trauma invalidate the entire field.
oh shit mb!!
Yall need to get some sleep!
omg its 12345
may I also remind you Tham, that you crossed some quite bloody lines when bringing up the negatives of Japan earlier, bringing up stereotypes that while can be true, bloodily dismisses the efforts of people right now, and then further dismiss anything good that can change either. It frankly felt like you'd rather push your point foward than understand that I have my own personal reason of wanting to study or at least live in japan. yk, cuz i have familial ties to it, that part of my personality and history is tied to it, and that i can enjoy japan with the knowledge of the failures and shortcomings, but also it's accomplishments
fr fr i have nursing lab at 8am but im going to be here until tham understands that he can't hate on nursing at a university that is top 10 for nursing in the usa
Tons of neglect and fed the wrong meds, botched iv drips, made jokes of my ailment
and if you have such an issue with nurses are you sure this is the career choice for you - styl (dont blame emma im using her computer)
Because I didn't want to do bio. Lmao
Also because I was like "oh this could be a backup" and I think it'd be pretty cool to apply it to medicine, although there are definitely more interesting things I could do if I were biomed engineering
But realistically I would not be able to balance BME and premed, plus as 121 has taught me I suck really badly at physics
MIX UPS HAPPEN
NEGLECT IS BAD BUT IT HAPPENS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL OF THEM DO IT
THERE ARE PROCEDURES AND FAILSAFES IN PLACE WORKING TO PREVENT IT
If ur gonna become a doctor and u hate nurses Iâ€™d either reconsider becoming a doctor or change ur views on nurses cause ur gonna work with them once u become one
like this cant be a real person
I donâ€™t hate hate them but dislike some of them not all
that last one does sound cruel
I've seen my dad come from blood donations with massive bruises cuz it got slightly botched, but he never rly blamed them cuz he knew it's hard
Ok good for you. NOw may i remind you that you just said you hate nurses
I did pass out getting blood drawn literally not two weeks ago
"I do hate most of them"
1 terrible nurse is not reflective of nurses as a whole
Omg yeah lol, that happened on my first and only surgery to date lmao
The nurses honestly did the best thing to solve it tho, at least for me
Well try having hand foot mouth as a kid and having poxes all around you and then joking while you canâ€™t even walk saying stop pretending to a dam 7 years old
And I am genuinely sorry that you had a terrible experience, it shouldn't have happened but it did and I'm sorry like actually. But I need you to get it through your head that not all nurses are like that. Just like how not all people are shit
it sounds more like just having to learn the fact that not all people are like that. I have my own traumas (hell I got trauma of hispanic people cuz I got such severe mistreatment from my ex that it brutally destroyed mental health) but I always understood to get over it because it's a false reality and that out of the one bad apple there are many more who are better
common anti-science tactic. how many times have people tried to use nebraska man or some other fraud example to debunk evolution.
this is my personal experience, but since i was 4 years old, i had SEVERE stomach issues and pains and the doctor i went to diagnosed me with an ulcer, i went to different doctors, got diagnosed with obesity or bad diet, 

fast forward 11 years later when i was 15, i got rushed to the ER TWICE in 2 days because all those years of misdiagnosing were actually gallbladder stones which got found out because a nurse so **exactly where** i was in pain taking her time while the doctor way too busy, so she told the doctor and the doctor took an ultrasound

The point is that we are all trying to make, there are good and bad sides to every single profession in the world, but professions that work together need to understand that its a team effort, especially for doctors and nurses, there are inconsistencies worldwide, but that exists in every profession, those gaps will exist if nothing is taking place to fix those gaps. Each one of us has our own likes and dislikes, but rejecting or not considering the opinion of another will cause infallacies.
wow it's almost like it's a bad idea to generalize an entire group of people
No. Stop that. Don't try to throw statistics into this. I know that some nurses suck. But not everyone has the same experience
Except us they gaslight me into believing I had nothing
OH MY
when I was a kid I had to get a blood test and whoever was doing it kept commenting about how "juicy" my veins were and on getting the juiciest spot so I noped out
IF YOU ARE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY
who DOESN'T have some form of medical horror story
I ageee with you on that one Iâ€™m just worried as a friend at that time as I seen many people were disillusioned with things before
Yeah it wasnâ€™t gallbladder stones though. I just was missing a bunch of stomach acid so my food just wasnâ€™t digesting and I would be throwing it up instead. So basically they still couldnâ€™t find a solution so I basically just have make sure that I donâ€™t eat foods that can upset my stomach or require a long time to digest otherwise I will throw them up
Literally had sessions of 4 hours of straight pain for weeks
i had one so bad
hopefully you didn't sound as vampiric as this particular person
Itâ€™s not about the money, but trying to do the most good I could
*rubs hands together* **nice veins there buddy, would be a shame if smtg happened to them**
welp im scared of hayley
i feel like shes gonna stab a vein
don't be scared of me :( im very nicies i just get really intense sometimes
FUCKING EPIC MAN
nurses hate this one trick!!
@tham0720 stop typing, you're making it worse. :frogeshh:
i can pop my veins to the point you can almost see the whole thing like a damn tube out of my hand lol
TBH the real reason was that I was like that but for my extended family, letâ€™s just say just say sometimes extended family are hit or miss as my fathers mother is letâ€™s say a monster as she cares more about her dog who tried to mauled my baby sister to death amid not for my mom shielding her, my aunts treated me like trash and tried scamed my father (youngest child ) out of his inheritance when his father died, my grandma (father side) laughed when I was injured and I was bullied by my cousin. While I fact I may not know about your extended family I know the pain if there is a chance of it turning bad and I belive no one should have experienced betrayal from your own kin thus I want to indirectly try to prevent another experience like mine
buddy, i've already been betrayed by people enough times, i cannot feel things like pain very much anymore
and i was feeling like shit
friend of ours that isn't in the discord but with us rn
I've dealt with many internet trolls of various types in my dark past. it doesn't go anywhere. one times someone faked having DID, got exposed, got banned, then kept coming back on alt accounts with pretty poor disguises until we inevitably discovered it was them and banned them again. it was so funny once we stopped being annoyed and just started laughing at them.
plus i'm already aware of some of the family drama. I've seen it happen with my own bare eyes. I witnessed it when i was 5, and on my aunt and uncles night after their wedding too. I've always remembered that scene and knew smtg was deeply wrong with my family
pain cannot be measured the same for everyone. So no, i can't say that i've been betrayed by my own kin. But I can say that as the newer generation of my lineage I can do better, and i can't do that without knowing what went wrong in the past
THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE A DOCTOR - Styl
Please don't be a doctor if you have no faith in humanity. Doctors should be the people with the most faith in humanity
Still want to try to at least do good
HI STYL (IDK KNOW YOU YET BUT I LIKE ALANS CAT EARS)
im sorry
oh nah
yeah with hate
theres a thin line between equally and properly
it's the same thing with music. We joke about certain sections being stereotypically bad, but we all know at the end of the day we can't make good, soul filled music without having deep rooted heart that doesn't come from half-heartedness and vengeance, but rather love, care, and a passion to do their best with others
except for when you shit talked nurses bro
i sense no love in your heart. No kindness. The love has left you long ago annd you need to go find it you can't keep doing this. The world may have abandoned you but the poeple will not
aint no way
bro don't be dense 😭
What is a viola but a worse violin for
I've learned even while just learning about computers, that no matter how god damn powerful a component is, it might as well be paper weight and be worth nothing without the coders and computer scientists
thats a conversation you dont want to start
because theyre bad people?
you can't be serious
slow mode please oml
yeah short story for you charlie, tham was being mean about nurses and it escalated quickly because i am a very passionate person and i will not let hating slide. admittly i am slightly at fault here and may have gone too far in some places but tham was being heavliy discrimatory
tham speedran "not as bad as arnav" real quick
@gwineafowl i never said i fuck with you THAT heavy
bro does not want to be a cs major 😭
it wasn't even the nurse thing, the mods just really got stuck on the sushi slander
bye
Because he wasnâ€™t inciting a war
Quite honestly it's almost 2am and it looks like that already got out of hand enough
sorry about that tho, we kinda went into the flames too tho
If someone is violating the spirit of the rules but not the letter of them we usually have to discuss more, especially if it's a slow trickle of slightly bad faith behavior mixed into generally okay interaction
it seems arnav is an important character
Bad
DONT TELL ME UR STARTING IT NOW
all of you matriculated college students need to sleep
And if you still don't feel well for a while then to go see a doctor or something
nah i still have work to do
I had to prevent hate on the server â˜¹ï¸
i'd hate to hear his opinions on minorities
id rather be a snowflake than a sad hateful person
shorter than this though
go sleep
uh oh...
clarisse dont u have a test tmrw
uh oh....
GO ACE THAT SHIT GIRL
my headache disappeared tho!!!
dealing with haters 101: the real snowflakes are the ones who can't live in the same world with people different from them
Ngl I still don't know who you are
damn bro was so hateful I got psychic damage
Disclaimer: I wonâ€™t
Never before have I seen â€œseveral people are typingâ€ so many times beforeâ€¦
i didnt mean ti reply to you
i am guilty of microwaving and eating a bowl of popcorn for the last hour
I lost the game
had the whole gang around my laptop screen like it was a movie
I don't care who you like or don't like, but let's not make this a space where we go to hate on others
i want a pet alligator
seriously guys get to bed. I'm incapable of leaving until everybody's done talking.
My apologies, but Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t do that
||im still lurking too||
Oh heck no
wrong time to post that
Mariah Carey has not been unleashed yet
its too early
stay scared chat
omg do u have chem lab
aw time?
wtf
welp rip my sense of perception i never moticed
ITS GONNA TAKE AT LEAST UNTIL 3 TO TRANSCRIBE ALL THESE DAMN TABLES 😭
im never taking an 8 am lab again
omg
I still haven't taken chem 113 😅
I added a second major last semester, and the new major requires chem lab. That's how I got this far without taking it
They donâ€™t need to know 🤫
better late than never
I have also never seen her in my lecture hall either lmao
ong this is so bad
Wtf is that
is calc 3 that hard
it's hard when your'e doing smtg stupid like me
aka comp e and music, being at 19 credits and then taking another 0 credit hour class ;-;
19 credits is rough, I could never (tried once, that's why I have a W on my transcript)
0 credit class is evil
how many classes r u taking 😭
I think the math department is trying to allocate less professors to calc 3 and diffeq
which is kinda awful for me cuz i'm just decent at math but not great at it
damn thats rough
i hate this but this is the first time i'm ever using AI to help me with this cuz it's just so damn hard for me to understand, cuz i can't find things to tie these concepts to the real world in some cases
Why is robin actually making me about to cry tears of joy wtf
Maybe I'm just too far gone into the math major . . . Calc 3 sounds like a nice mental break for me at this point
I can now actually feel things tonight wtf
but some of this is rly hard for me to be able to tie down to a real world concept (aka why i faired better in physics)
It's been a minute since I took calc 3, but if you want some help wrapping your head around concepts try asking me sometime. Or other upperclass math people on this server
i cannot give a shit 😭
why are yall still up
there is also blood on my paper cuz i had a bloody nose too lmao that's how bad it is
Rip
I wish you the best nap of your life once you can rest
Shut up Princeton Review Iâ€™m already in college
im sleeping like 2hours
I come back to the room to find my roommate sleeping on the floor
It feels like it should be Friday
Why isnâ€™t it Friday?
I hope to god kyle's still sleeping if he did
kyle is fucking cooked
iâ€™m so hungry
i went to sleep so late last night i forgot to eat
7 minutes left
dw you still got this
no one could study with what happened last night
like wym you donâ€™t want me to visit japan because i want to take scenic photographs and meet relatives for the first time
Me when the online textbook stops working the day of the test
At least if weâ€™re talking about when I actually fell asleep
WHY ARE YOU AWAKE
What is the fast and slow responses for?
But like you know the fast and slow responses to stimuli? That thing? What unit essentially was it part of?
I donâ€™t believe we went over that, but if I were to guess it is related to reinforcement scheduling in operant conditioning
I donâ€™t remember that specifically though
Iâ€™d need more context to understand what your specific context is though
Dw I skipped all my earlier classes to sleep in
I guess Iâ€™ll just admit at this point that I may not be able to help you 😅
Only 3 confirmed hours of it
but 6 isnt prime
so technically you slept 7 hours
I woke up at 9:30 today
I feel about as rested as being violated by the Geneva Conventions
After this class itâ€™s gonna be naptime
naptime without time is still a nap
A human without an is hum
idk what's going on because my wifi is fine but it's taking an hour to download a 55 mb file

Absolute shit lmao
Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that
Mines went so bad they couldnâ€™t get the readings for one of my solutions cause it was too dark 😭
You never know
It could have gone better than you thought!
the fact i didn't even get an answer nor any of the steps tells me i did not do shit
Shit was so red
The machine couldnâ€™t even record it
It was that bad 😭
Bro its not that bad
i don't like calc 3 rn ;-;
i just don't like it
i'm also rly rly tired and lowkey the mapping unit is p ass for me
Same thing happened with me for #4, but I redid it before the scan
wtf
oop- i just didnt bother and filled it halfway and the ta said it was fine :mochicreep:
Also I hate 1 mL volumetric pipettes with a *passion*
Are you f*cking serious
sometimes you just gotta cheese your way through this shit
I mean it all turned out fine in the end
Man everyone left I was like the second to last person there 😭
accuracy has left the chat
😭 i had mine on tuesday and tried to do the calculations but i kept getting like 500 for everything we're all cooked
I was the last 🥲
how dare you leave kyle behind
Man that wasnâ€™t Kyle 😭
and somehow gets away with it
Whyâ€™d u leave Kyle behind
I DIDNT SEEHIM
they ran out today though
theres more but i dont get them
Does freshman forgiveness apply to math 223 lol
They have blueberry still
first and last
Ramen is close
he forgot a letter
nope
nope
nope
honestly leo here has the most material to work with
he can find out in literally 3@ seconds
thatâ€™s hilarious though
nope
i havenâ€™t the faintest clue
nope
she WANTS THE MUFFIN
yeah he's still spewing that shit on the food rating server
Itâ€™s definitely not bad but itâ€™s sad if itâ€™s best
i want muffins:mochiclap:
Also he never confirmed it
fair
found your instagram
bio said tbls â€˜24
found their class of 2024 college decision page
found you
omg not the pinterest too
nope
i donâ€™t even have pinterest
i donâ€™t wanna join it due to the presence of another individual
Iâ€™m already there unfortunately
Not individual items as of yet though
i was bored
Damn nice
i forgot abt it tbh
I want a publication one day
IT WAS ON CAR DEPENDENCY
WRONG ONE
IDK WHO THAT IS
@katsukurry_32009 WRONG PWRSON
Idk
Idk if it's school sponsored but someone gave me a promo invite thing for it
There was a trick or treating event earlier where you go to campus buildings and get candy
oh what the
Too bad I was passed out + lab
I donâ€™t got one
iâ€™m doing a makeshift sherlock holmes rn (cuz my sister wanted to go) but next year when im on campus, im gonna be spending TIME at thinkbox
Although I realized this morning that another costume I could also pull off is burnt-out college student
Not bad but not incredible
and i've had those muffins stolen from me before :( too bad so sad
cant touch your phones in lab
Shit really
:omg:
oh
not me getting a 30% percent average deviation for today's lab :omg:
something got screwed up somewhere but i dont care enough to fix it so i'm submitting
Alan you didnâ€™t wear your gi and hakama?
im so sorry
Has anyone done the RKE lab for PHYS 121? I just don't get it at all
I'm trying to write down the theory part rn but I just don't get that part at all
Also my Ip is really far off from my Ie and I have no idea why at all
Oh damn
I probably did something wrong, which I guess wouldn't be so bad on its own as long as I can give a different reason why it's so far off, I just don't know what
Think about this: Force times distance (Fx) is equal to work. This is energy the system is losing because of friction. Remember that the system is gaining rotational kinetic energy because of the gravitational potential energy being converted from the hanging mass. The idea is that if we add more mass, we have more energy in the system supplied by gravitational potential. So if you have enough mass so that you have the normal energy for the experiment + just enough energy to be equal to the energy lost from friction, then you basically cancel them out and no longer worry about friction
Energy from gravity = mgh + Mgh, so the goal is to make â€œmghâ€ equal to the energy lost from friction
Î”K = W
Where W = Work from conservative forces + work from nonconservative forces. Gravity is a conservative force while friction is a nonconservative force

Î”Îš = Wf + Wg
Wg = -Î”Uw by definition, so

Î”K + Î”Uw = Wf
2 aleks topics left 😭
can't save you but I can help
if need be
Holy fuck I finished it
i hate this unit
does anyone know what happens if i dont finish my aleks tn?
does it close or...?
crap there's 16 more for me to do next week
and u dont get the points
fuck okay
im j gonna cry while doing it
Thank you so much both of you 🙏 I'd be so lost without you two
everyone here is stressed because they got to complete physics homework
@katsukurry_32009 needs to finish hers up because she has a shift at santas workshop starting at midnight
oh i dont have to do my work
I honestly think I need to meet with one of the professors because I literally cannot figure out how to make physics work
thatâ€™s honestly fair
I've started tutoring, I've gone to the SI homework sessions, I'm trying stuff but it's just not working
physics is really confusing
When I do physics it literally feels like my brain is trying to push a block but it's so weak it feels fatigued just from the effort
while itâ€™s working
how would each individual part work
When I did physics the thing that helped things make the most sense is seeing the concept in action and then using the equations and laws to explain what happened
Dw I will, I don't really have a choice ;-;
I'm going on a road trip tomorrow so I still gotta pack
iâ€™ll cry if i do
never been
Didnâ€™t know she was still touring
So he was thinking also when he tried to basically gamble for them that he would sell them if he didn't want to go
Or Karma, idk
damn ur dad must be making a shit ton of money
I mean I do want to do surgery, but I'm def more timid and reserved than he is
1 more aleks module left
i usually hit one up in manhattan when im bored
Thereâ€™s definitely some missing
because the 20+ in manhattan isnt included
the relief goes hard trust
How much casecash do I have left 🤔
Iâ€™ve had too much candy today
CUZ NYC ROCKS
i still have 58 dollars 🙏
Ha, broke 🫵
u actually suck
i dont get it all the time because i like to sometimes pick up shakes from jolly or have the ice cream from the dining halls so i dont burn through the ice cream very fast
Of broke
I FORGOT
still didnt get them!
yea i have 1 dollar left
me when i want a samosa at choolah
I didn't even realize
this was here
💀
Why tf does 10 minutes fill me with more energy than several hours
when you wake up with less hours of sleep, your brain triggers specific functions to act aware and fully awake, ready to go at a moments notice but it only does that for a brief time
however when you sleep 7 hours or more you feel tired because your brain is returning to normal functionality and boots up as normal
That nap was 4 hours ago and Iâ€™m still going
When you sleep like 9 hours and feel worse than you went to sleep
And I donâ€™t even remember sleeping either
help me chem 111 feels tpo long to be 50 minutes
feels like we have been here for 90 minutes minimum
do not cause mass hysteria in the name of leaving class seven minutes early
your opinion will be taken into light consideration
late
Will you eat the bananas, or will you leave them for someone to find?
^ food waste bad
as long as they are just etched and the inside isn't tampered with 💀
sage is my hard main though
but my computer
i play when i need to (my friends yell at me to)
damn you play in japanese?
you ate
left no crumbs
Also god dammit I lost my eraser
because EVERYTHING EVEN GRAPHIC SETTINGS ARE IN JAPANESE
What the fuck is going on above the Euclid potbellyâ€™s lmao
I am not joking, it says GAY SEX right above it
I have class in 30 minutes
Btw if anyone wants the remaining etched banana (Alanâ€™s getting one and someone in japancase im guessing will get it) dm me lmao
Only if you donâ€™t get the shikanoko banana
Thatâ€™s the one I want
Actually no Iâ€™m eating one Iâ€™m hungry
I WANT CONNAMACHER 😭
i keep getting messages like â€œhey what are you doing this afternoon kamalaâ€™s gonna be in madison todayâ€ even if i wanted to get there i physically cannot make it in time without getting a reckless driving charge
â€œhey do you want to drive a sustained average of 290 mph to be here by 5?â€
I considered just staying inside when the fire alarm went off but
Sound was annoying
the fakest filipino in this college 💀
cuz im genuinely losing my mind over why jshell doesnt recognize a class
i mean it doesnt really matter if u send code or not
Right arrow: 30 years old

When the throbber in your mind doesnâ€™t go away
Wtf are you for real???
is MyTester a class
even though i wrote the class properly and used /open to open it
i used intellij when i do java coding tho so
jetbrains IDEs always seem to just work
hours of hard work and I can't even rotate a triangle
oh 😭
it'a prob a java/computer being stupid thing
yeah you're not fixing that unless you want to do more work lmao
idt you can even really fix floating point imprecision 😭
there are probably ways to get around it though
you can't unless you want to overcome the hardware limitation itself
wait now im wondering how calculators dont really seem to have problems with floats?
and the way they do integrals isn't by actually integrating, it's just like taking several thousand riemann sums under the functions
Just realized conamacher should totally give out a free one hundred if someone makes code that can play bad apple using only non video methods
Itâ€™d be far more surprising if that isnâ€™t what he said
THIS GUY ASKED ME FOR A PENCIL BEFORE PHYSICS EXAM
AND THEN GAVE IT AWAY TO SOMEONE ELSE 💀
and somehow delay the exam
DONT
what the fuck
leo u need therapy.
I donâ€™t like where this is going
I didnâ€™t say anything beyond that lmao
I just realized thereâ€™s one shirt in my wardrobe that baffles me
Thereâ€™s no design and itâ€™s just gray, I donâ€™t know where it came from or how itâ€™s in my wardrobe either
Idk
donâ€™t.
Genuinely very dangerous please don't
I now realize what is wrong with this image
Donâ€™t do that
funnier would be to chop off the grounding pin on my laptop charger and stick it in like that
(i am not doing that, i do not need a fire)
cuz i realized i could
the more u fuck around the more u find out
i'd like to test it, but only in an isolated area where class c extinguishers with a kill switch for the electricity exists
Physics lab? (Idk and either way jk please don't)
cuz they only premiered it in theaters in the united states and have yet to release it to any services in the united states
Itâ€™s fucking Arnav
I donâ€™t understand bro
Tho if he said any anime character I wouldâ€™ve been shocked to my core
Chem 111 friends how does it feel we only have like 4 more quizzes
Excuse me what the fuck
thank fuck, tho idk whats on this next one
i was half asleep doing the aleks
cuz my original ones were ass
i did for the stuff on the second exam, but i may need to go back and do everything
Dr Java has been frozen for the past ten minutes and I already restarted my computer and all of my (little but still very significant) progress is on there istg
I don't know how to get the files 😭 I think I put them on the online Case home drive thing
leo and kyle yall suck
i dont eat bacon
oh fuck nvm then
idk
im gna do dumplings once ppl leave for the party
do your work on another java, then paste it into java citrix
or at least copy that work and paste it else where so you don't lose it
I also just tossed everything into the downloads of the Case home drive because I never thought this would happen
Now that I think about it too I think files I copied on VS code and saved got lost into the void somewhere
So they're just sitting in some unknown location in my Mac and I have no idea how to find them in my Finder
all this food talk making me hungry
YOU DIDNT KNOW THIS?
IDK I'M PRETTY SURE WE GET OUR SOUP DUMPLINGS ELSEWHERE (were I don't know tho)
OH CITRUS
ive never been to trader joes
Well, there's one in Ohio, I think it's kinda far from Case tho
But considering you've never gone, you should def go
theres one a mile away from me
Agreed, if I remember from when I had it, it doesnâ€™t really taste like ube either
its like 30 min away
Havenâ€™t had in a while but I remember liking it
it just seems off putting
OH
I think it's at CAM Asia downtown? Don't take my word for it tho
Idk
not avaliable near me
It's been an hour I don't think I'm getting my code back unless Citrix logs me out itself within the next like 7 hours
It isnâ€™t at all common
come to think of it idk if it was even in the us
wtf
not really
forgot the polls channel lol
But mint choco doesnâ€™t have that much mint
Unrelated note: would someone be willing to swipe mozzarella sticks at the den for me?
I want
already used 7 this week wow
Is it sad that much of my meals are from late night?
and only do it for dinner so I donâ€™t run out of swipes
and suddenly somehow *ran* out
even the commons arenâ€™t the same
I usually donâ€™t get leutner (hence why I have no late night swipes)
some weeks Iâ€™m worse at avoiding it
when itâ€™s after 6 and youâ€™re hungry
Normal dining hall hours end at 8
guess im joining kyle on late night
bruh not me getting a 502 bad gateway redirevt from sis
its such a good damn show and series

Writer rly did bake their own cake and ate it too
OH WHAT THE FUCK LMAO
it doesnt' get this dark during the summer in texas till almost 8:30 my sense of time is still super fucked
itâ€™s not late night yet
I have no fucking clue, tho is that cuz you need an arts/humanities credit?
The film is slow enough (and cleveland is grey enough) having a prime lens that can get nice and wide is important to be able to get enough light
Nah that feels mean

never too late
Ngl I actually don't know when I'm supposed to take it, I still haven't even taken Bio 214 yet
I hate to break it to you but
Damn 15 minutes
i have class at 11:30 and theres no way it takes less than 2-3 hrs
don't care too much
though on second thought it might not be the best idea to miss a calc quiz
do u think the line will be long early in the morning
I hate flipped classroom
The reason it exists is because in class Bader lectures are mostly worse versions of the online lectures
yeah well I dont wanna listen to his voice and take notes for 1-3 hours
and end up arguing with your test group until you realize you all won't finish
For mcq you oftentimes need to understand how the man does things in order to get it
I've heard he's bad
I havenâ€™t understood baderspeak yet
Which isnâ€™t good for a person whoâ€™s supposed to teach
Are you a college student? Are you incapable of voting tomorrow for reasons pertaining especially to not being in your state of residence? Congratulations, you have been **disenfranchised.** You have every reason to complain. Abolish the electoral college today.
1. He is very particular about language. Vagueness in wording is unacceptable, so always be specific when you can. Also be sure you donâ€™t accidentally say something which might be interpreted as having a separate meaning.

2. Everything he does has some purpose, even if it seems annoyingly off-topic or completely unrelated. You need to understand his thought process behind why he decided to talk about something. Extracting meaning from all the fluff is essential.

3. This was more of an issue for Exam 1. Bader, from what it seems, is more interested in students understanding the principles and being able to apply them to circumstances. For example, in Exam 1 some of the diagrams for the MCQ questions did not precisely correspond to the question being asked, and in some cases were slightly misleading. His explanation, I kid you not, was: â€œI found some images online that essentially matched what I was going for.â€ As a result, when I based an answer entirely on the diagram I got that question incorrect. In scenarios like this one should not concern themselves with the specific details of a diagram and focus more so on the wording of the question itself and what concept Bader is trying to invoke. 

(This method of test making is definitely one of his objectively poor aspects, as it would be impossible to know going into the first exam)

4. Take notes on both the flipped classroom and the textbook. Yes, itâ€™s annoying. Yes, itâ€™s much more work than necessary, but doing both and then going to a lecture essentially allows you to review material twice over. What I like to do is take notes on the lecture first, read the textbook and write down everything from there that the annotated lecture didnâ€™t cover, and then take notes during the actual lecture.
5. Go with the flow. You will get a lot more out of the class if youâ€™re engaged. Feeling resentful towards Bader and his quirks during a lecture can inhibit oneâ€™s willingness to learn from him. Once I decided to embrace what he does I found it much easier to take in what he teaches. And when I say embrace it I mean *everything*, even the stuff that is definitely there for no reason (like the video from today)
Yeah Iâ€™m gonna start implementing these things into my study
man #5 is so real and this applies to basically any annoying class
For Bader though itâ€™s more of a â€œthis is just how he isâ€
wrong muhsin
Damn lmao
we have the same last initial too which is why i use both my last names now
Damn lmao
Well do you want the leopards to eat *your* face?
what? of course thatâ€™ll never happen!
the LEPFP obviously only wants leopards to eat OTHER peoplesâ€™ faces
I donâ€™t believe so
but it probably gets worse as the day goes on
Congratulations, you have been **Disenfranchised.** You have the right to complain. Abolish the electoral college today.

Nothing different from 4 years ago thus farâ€¦
It can really go either way still

Iâ€™m leaving for Canada
Iâ€™m leaving for Japan
fuck you, jill stein
Oh shit nvm
holy shit
and end last
the cities havenâ€™t finished counting
I mean I will hold out some hope till tomorrow but it's really looking like we are screwed
I donâ€™t want to go back to Texas now lowkey
fuck
bro some people need to open their eyes
Guys Iâ€™m so scared I canâ€™t have trump for the next 4
would it be worse than the last 4
GOT CUT 35%
I think Ohio went to Trump by the higher margin then Texas this election tbh. 
And we just lost our Democratic senator to another crazy maga guy 

It's all around really scary
the guy who said "fuck abortion"
If trump wins im trying to to hide for as ling as possible
Damn
bernie moreno and his stupid hulu ads
EWWW WTF :madge:
my parents told me
does your uncle also work at nintendo
Except the stakes instead of money is our future
like even if some of it doesnâ€™t get passed
thatâ€™s still quite a bit of **fucking** damage
Itâ€™s close in nc
michigan isnt even 30% reported
I think if we dont get the blue belt we fucked
can go either way
MI, WI, PA, OH, IL, IN
i dont think kamala is popular with the muslims there 😭
I think yall need to be studying
oh il and in already called
We should but I donâ€™t think any of us are in the mental state to do so
Project 2025 is so scary
yeah its so fucking bad
i cant lock in bro
georgia went backwards???
went down to 88%
wtf
Donâ€™t blame them
I just realized michigan  turned red😭
we lost our blue wall
makes sense tho
but it can work
the cities count first and always end last
due to the sheer volume
is it a hard class for someone with no coding xp
ive coded in java before but honestly writing code on paper is just terrible
Always leave like an inch of space between your public class thing and the next thing you write in the body of the code
if u take it during the summer they let u do all of the coding for assignments and tests on a computer but this costs money
it was still kinda gnarly even with coding experience
gap in wisconsin is dead low
absolutely dead low
Out of curiosity, how much coding experience did you have when starting 132 Tennyson and Skylazer?
but i never touched inheritance
not really
Called states still following 2020
but the suburbs are near finishing up
but the cities are still getting ballots into the system
java was my 2nd programming language 1st time doing everything in class based structures and shit like that
they havent counted all of philly yet right
Garlic Noodles if you plan on taking it tho I can help you out if you'd like
Still a chance
alright i looked at a FUCK TON
over the last century
honestly guys dont be scared of 132 its an incredible course and the instructors are goated and are super motivated to help you
how hard does it get at the end
PA just went back into tossup
I'm worried about PA and AZ
due to covid effect
Still leaning trump
i've heard connamacher's exams are graded a little harder so you'll just have to see. i took it with ozguner who graded exams relatively lightly. the final project ofc is the hardest one
oh
just start shit early and ask questions as they come up
honestly i thought i was cooking by finishing the programming project early but i didnt really do much with the time 😭
FUCK
Genuinely terrible
isnt she pro zionist
Fucking nc
nc is gone probably
Skylazer want to cram? 😭
We need kamale to win pls
comedic shit
Why did we have to have this test the day after the last election day
how do our fucking americans
want to
put a damn
We cant let project 2025 happen
into office
Again, mi is still only barely over 30%
Ngl weâ€™re ab to lose GA
Weâ€™re about to lose ga too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2p-im7cxa4&ab_channel=JohnWilliams-Topic
In the bad ending, this is what he would queue
half of the US population donâ€™t have a brain or have an inferiority complex or think theyâ€™re gonna be rich one day and benefit from trumps tax policies
isnt that what both sides typically do as election results near
live feed from kamala hq is dead fucking silent too
itâ€™s a fucking nail biter
IT ISNT OVER TILL ITS OVER
that doesn't sound good :omg:
would you want an immigrant thatâ€™s sexist, a felon, and a criminal in the country
then asked him why he wanted one in office
so i just walked away
Thereâ€™s still a chance
Reef, thatâ€™s brave of you to do (and also smtg I do not recommend to do in Texas lest you want your brains to be blown out of your head by chance)
Kamala needs to win every state after this thoughâ€¦
South Carolina did but for the worse
(canâ€™t get shot in new york lol)
arizona is really close
she canâ€™t afford PA
cuz this shit giving me a headache
These folks got the last six elections right
Still, no states have flipped
Kamala needs to win Pennsylvania
so has kamala lost GA at this point
Harris is like 25 away from trump's 230
Ive also noticed that trumps electoral votes have stopped at 230
Sheâ€™s down 3 points with 91% reporting, but again, most of that last nine percent will be cities and absentees, which swing democratic
This is looking like Kamalaâ€˜a worst case scenario
Cuz this is causing me fucking anxiety
AZ hasnâ€™t moved
Weâ€™re all gonna be awake way too late tonight
Nah I'm going to quickly skim the rest of the review topic thing for 132 then sleep and wake up early
guys I can't do this 😭😭
what the fuck is happening
nope now iâ€™m cooked
Me doodling out of stress instead of actually stu dying
I can't think at all
Erm maybe not tho
oh relly
I'm breaking down trying to figure out what an iterator and iterable is
We don't need to know that tho do we??? I missed class
Alex sent me the notes but still
dont play with my feelings bro
Alan you will make me cry
i was about to lose it
im only doing it cuz its in the hw problem 😭
shit where
bro lost track 😭
so i cant lock in
we gonna be screwed for more than 4 years if we lose this 😭
i think thats when the last votes come
michigan won't be done till like
Oh we got Hawaii
gojo shouldve ran for president
I wish you could deduct votes for one side except it only applies to trump
Gojo needs to take the red and blue and make the country purple
Gm, i wont be sleeping tonight
How are you enjoying the 14 hours and 10 minutes before the exam?
don't remind me.
fuck florida
domain expansion: into a plane and out this hoe
Harris needs to domain expansion in pennsylvania rn.
we can still go to taiwan!!!
You should show us around (I am getting hungry and want good food 😭)
harris needs to make a binding vow to extend her range in exchange of having her domain be barrierless
i feel ashamed of my state sometimes
real shit
WHAT THE FUCK
PA CANT SELL THE CLUTCH
TERRIBLE
no FAIR
We should have tmr off to grieve I feel
IF THEY DONT CLUTCH
I stress showered just now wtf
cant have two bad things happen back to back
PA gap has slowly gone down to 175k
210 to 230 now tho
Iâ€™m so stressed Iâ€™m gonna unclog the fucking pores in my nose
We lost senate too
someone hollow purple the shaded purple
i was supposed to sleep early today
> Lol you didn't vote for my candidate, therefore you shouldn't have the basic human privilege of clean water.
like they dont know how bad flint is 😭
Donâ€™t go on twitter
idk wassup with Flint, both republicans and democrats have ignored them for years lol
We did in 2016... guess where that led us
Apparently Pennsylvania got 180K Amish voters for trump
itâ€™s not just Joever anymore, its time to Killmala my Harriself
ga looks like its gone
We all need to cope hard and hope a miracle is pulled for PA
Iâ€™m curious what happens if trump wins, since the gop propaganda arm is already claiming itâ€™s rigged
its only rigged if they lose
I will have a fucking aneurysm if such bullshit happen
Or a heart attack, which seems much more likely with my physical conditions
Is it really
we can't loose pa can we?
we need insane amount of copium
FUCK
the fucking
No fuck this Jesus Christ
is this stupid
She needs to pull off Pennsylvania
if pa is gone too its wraps
If she doesn't win Pennsylvania, it's joever for her
(Iâ€™m coping hard and trying to do napkin math)
With a gun democrats tried to ban
SO FUCKING STUPID
@reefrider You wouldn't believe what surprises turn the outcome of an election. In 2004, a yell was the single reason someone lost an election.
America was never ready for a female president
iâ€™m not even surprised
my head is just
In a mayoral race (I forgot which), someone got exposed for being a drug addict and he got MORE votes and won the election
actually he was already projected to drop out, and Dean scream was the last straw
Go to sleep 😭
I have napkin math for if Georgia and Pennsylvania are declared by AP to be red, which is that Kamala can theoretically still win with a margin of 2
"those darn blue collar and working class americans, they need to stop voting"
I mean lose in pa
tell me how & ill say why it wont work
AP still hasnâ€™t called Georgia
ap also didnt call NH
Weâ€™re gonna cope till associated press says so
itâ€™s so close
I donâ€™t wanna cope anymore
I lost hope after nc
It made me sad to be from nc
i lost my ability to cope
I donâ€™t like this at all itâ€™s so fucking disheartening;-;
Kamala needs to win by 221,000 votes more with less than 10% votes left to win
Thatâ€™s not how to do the math for it unfortunately
They have 5 mins
Is close in Arizona
With 6% of votes in GA left, Kamala needs 127,000 more votes than Trump
Wait, I get why GA hasnâ€™t been called AP tho
Thereâ€™s still like 311k votes left to count in that state I think tho?
@leowhygamma Just a projection, we don't know how many people voted
FUCK THAT EGENERAL DIRECTION
True, tho Iâ€™m still coping with GA
sigh
Theyâ€™re gonna take till next election to finish tho
i donâ€™t know why
I hate watching this itâ€™s actually anxiety inducing like hell but I cannot stop watching this anymore
FUCK
What's wrong with voting for a felon?
GA is gone
this ainâ€™t no robert downey junior comeback
Guys, if Kamala doesn't get PA, it's over.
Damn Nevada 18%
they counting fast damn
They were like oh no no no weâ€™re not gonna be last donâ€™t even think about it girl
Up to 600 ishk votes left in PA theoretically
Sorry
I have an exam tomorrow morning....
As a POC, I am scared.
I am very scared,
I donâ€™t want to think about the future nowâ€¦
fuck erie county is red
Iâ€™m from Texas and if itâ€™s a republican future, I could very well be shot deadâ€¦
if bucks county doesnt flip i think we mifgr be cookj3ed
Has anyone called pa yet
for what cause
people in florida canâ€™t STAND the hurricanes
The mayor got caught taking bribes so
If we lose PA we cannot win
wtf
erie & bucks county matched presidency for last several elections
Like no combination of states under our control will work
Wisconsin looks gone too so it seems over no matter what
If PA is lost, every remaining state excluding Alaska must be Kamala to win
Idk why people are focusing on other states. Guys, if she loses PA she loses the race
If PA wins, thereâ€™s a bit more of a comfortable margin to lose some other states
which wont happen bc out of nv, az, MI and WI, one will go red
cuz US
can't believe im waking up to this tomorrow
i think we're cooked if bucks doesnt flip
do you guys think if i tried transferring to a college in europe id be accepted
Someone call pa
THEY DIDNT
to end our misery
Oh
HWY THE FUCK DO TEXANS VOTE FOR TED CRUZ
MORHERFUCKER ABANDONED THE STATE WHEN EVERYBODY NEEDED HIM IN 2021 TO HELP SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS THAT LEGIT HAD PEOPLE DYING FROM HYPOTHERMIA BECUZ OF MISMANAGEMENT. HE FLEW OUT TO CANCUN
guys stop crying and listen to kyle
it aint over till it is
Kill me
Nvm no it isnâ€™t
He sucks ass, and his media team sucks too, theyâ€™re so out of touch I hate him
She still needs 227k
omg PA just got called
No it hasnâ€™t nvm
Scared me
I'm gonna need that opened 11th floor window
Ted Cruz off in Cancun while Texas is dying in a blizzard:
no we really arent
nothing
it aint over yet
i dont want to go to class tomorrow
thatâ€™s fair
i wanna die
Iâ€™ve never met this mysterious garlic noodles yet lmao
We have our names, you donâ€™t
I hope my exam gets cancelled tomorrow
Fair
oh im vegetarian
in due time
chat what we feeling about PA
this happened in my dream
i want to shit myself
because what the fuck
Unfortunately
Bad
And my dreams have predicted so many scores on exams and quizzes
Like dead ass
220k gap still
My parents are srsly considering moving back to Japan if trump wins this is bad
im seriously considering moving back to india
i have no choice but to stay here so i guess im just gonna have to lie low and get my degree and move out
i dont know
thats fair
i fear being alone might fuck me up
Fair honestly I would too seeing this happening
nope
Not yet, but weâ€™re all scared
Oh damn
PLEASE PA PULL THRU WE BEG OF IT TO HAPPEN
it wont be called until it isnt enough
Donâ€™t jinx it
Youâ€™re right sorry
realistically is still idk
just go to sleep after PA is called
all i wanted to do
i just wanted to live life being who i am and who i want to be
I don't even want to marry, I just want someone who doesn't change healthcare policy off a religous whim
someone should cut off his dick
see how he feels
Thatâ€™s honestly a mood, I want my worries to be if I have decent fashion taste, not if Iâ€™ll wake up the next day dead or with dead friends
I donâ€™t want to fucking hear it from the sellout entertainment channel Fox News
No the gap is bigger now tho
But only by like 20k votes smaller so itâ€™s still roughly 200k
I hate this
We all hate this
Even if pa did go blue its still basically over
This is actual hell wtf
I donâ€™t wanna go to classes tmr
it could tie.. thatâ€™s terrifying tho
I think pa is going to trump tho
Literally what would happen with a tie tho
Fuck
i will never not be mad
i will never meet my grandchildren oh dear god
Oh my goodness
Too many innocent people dying
I hope but weâ€™re allied with Israel so I donâ€™t know what heâ€™s going to do for ceasefire
He never even mentioned it
Nothing
Heâ€™ll figure it out in the most anal way possible to ensure nobody rly gets what they want
Because when Kamala Harris brought up ceasefire he got mad
Hate him so much
What do u think happened with the UN partition of Israelâ€¦?
Yeah my point, ceasefires arenâ€™t meant for both sides to get what they want
Itâ€™s just a temporary fix before shit hits the fan in a few years to decades from the agreement
Iâ€™m worried about domestic affairs too though
i ran buck county numbers, its still close
theyâ€™re recounting a shit ton in milwaukee wisconsin
i really donâ€™t think trump is going to push for ceasefire at all
*sigh*
detroit still has a lot to go
Im gonna lose it
I canâ€™t do this anymore
I donâ€™t like this
I want this to just be a bad dream
its starting to rain out
Even God is crying
Ugh I hate jill
Also I hate ppl that vote third party during close elections
Third parties would work great. IF WE DIDNT HAVE THIS SHIT SYSTEM LOKE WHY. CAN WE USE THE BRITISH STSTEM PLEASE???
Classic example of why 3rd parties donâ€™t work on a national level in the US: Election of 1912
They wont call PA until its 100% impossible because calling it is calling the election
Unless by some fucking miracle some other state was incorrectly called, weâ€™re fucked
i canâ€™t no more
Iâ€™m gonna do chem notes and then pass the fuck out whenever that will be
Just needs Alaska now
Kamala needs every state to win
More news channels are though
AP hasnâ€™t called Pennsylvania
and when I do idk if ill be okay
Thereâ€™s only a 100,000 vote lead for PA and 300,000 votes left to count
This is not gonna be good isnâ€™t it
theres my last dose of copium
Thereâ€™s no sleep with this misery inducing event
I need to brush my teeth
cheers to a country that doesnt love us
I cannot stand trumps fucking grin staring back at me every time I refresh the page it disgusts me
Damn, I would say is there anything I can do but I already know the answer is most likely no, so unfortunately, my condolences
phone boutta die
I donâ€™t rly wanna see that fucking face
leave
im not going to class tomorrow
except for engineering lab
bc i dont wanna make that shit up
tomorrows going to be shit, i was walking my friends home and the amt of police cars in the street is insane
i cant bring myself to do anything rn
even sleep
At least we donâ€™t have gun violence like Texas here? I hope?
Itâ€™s all up in the air
hill and fox have called for trump - ap still saying its too early to call
ap just called pa - they haven't called alaska so they haven't called the entire election but its joever chat
FUCK THIS SHIT
Iâ€™m gonna lose it
YOU CANT MAKE THIS SH*T UP
ok its time for me to lose myself in the world of gossip girl and cry
FUCK THIS
shit is in all caps and written by a 3rd grader lol https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform
I HAVE STAYED CALM THIS WHOLE NIGHT BUT THE MOMENT I HEARD THAT MUSIC I LOST IT
Fuck
We all ready to lose a bunch of rights and potentially for this university to get squashed to hell potentially by getting deep funding cuts?
daz if u need someone to hang out w, im gna be in my room/in smith the whole day
oh my lord
This guys gonna die and Vance is gonna be president
cuz he can fuck up
thatâ€™s worse
it doesnt matter
man someone reenact olympus has fallen irl
he takes the presidency he locks in the supreme court and the country will be stuck for many more years than just four
RIP John Tester
RIP Sherrod Brown
something i donâ€™t believe will happen
i fucking doubt it though
Canâ€™t wait for the economy to be absolutely fucked and for a good number of us to no longer be able to attend here
This makes me sick
even though there isnâ€™t a way
im starting that research right the fuck now
since youre not here yet
Sometimes I wish hand to hand violence was the correct answer
and they will ban gender affirming care for minors and so many trans people will die
As much as I hate it and Iâ€™m saying this with half seriousness, they want a cleansing of people
hell they might even be able to ban gender affirming care for adults
Aka death for many
i cant stay here
i need to move to europe
I donâ€™t want to stay here
theres no fucking hope left
i canâ€™t stop coping
fuck me
there are going to be so many deaths - poc killed by police empowered by trump policies, immigrants killed by people with guns, queer people killed by policies which block our access to medical care. So many people are going to die
Jesus what an absolute bloodbath of Democrats today. Lost the house, lost the senate, lost the presidency.
â€œWe want people to come back to our country but they have to do it *leagally*â€
its over there is no more hope - we will have four years of hate and we will be lucky if we have a functional democracy by the time its over
bro fuck elon musk
FUCK. HIM.
fuck elon musk holy shit
Itâ€™s called nominating an idiot for Democrat primary and making him win presidency when even he doesnâ€™t know heâ€™s still president.
And then deciding to still run until a few months before the election
He lied, democrats lost.
Sorry, not sorry.
its bound to happen
my parents are telling me to avoid crowds tomorrow everything's gonna be a shitshow :omg:
I donâ€™t know
I just need to breathe
My parents are asleep
They called it wraps 3 hours ago
We need civility, not a civil war
Able to spare another person?
OH THE IRONY
@mism0937 get your ass over here or weâ€™re leaving
Sorry
I need to get my umbrella
Trump says he wants unity
Yeah no Iâ€™m nowhere near asleep rn Jesus Christ
Iâ€™m being kept up for many reasons
What little of my health is left is going down the drain
I canâ€™t fucking sleep
Iâ€™m fucked arenâ€™t I lol
HOSPITAL.
It also happens when I donâ€™t sleep enough and then also super tense at the same time
I'm sorry
this country is gone bro
Country is gone
This might unironically be worse than 9/11
cant even make a joke its genuinely over
One can pray that he doesn't do what he was claiming he'd do
I donâ€™t wanna take my exam today
he hasnâ€™t been inaugurated yet
But with a much darker shade in a few months
Legit im too scared to even go outside today
hes still in power
damn
I got 5 hours of sleep, not feeling great
I feel like im running on pure fear as my energy source
Iâ€™m on 1 and a half
i feel like im gonna throw up at any sexons
Iâ€™m just as worried
Apparently profs will be lenient today or?
my cogsci prof cancelled class already
and like. even if votes continue to come in and somehow kamala takes the lead. trump would have far far more basis than 2020 to say it was stolen.
Campus feels like a shell of its self today itâ€™s eerie
everyones scared
fucking hell
Youâ€™re joking right? Like surely he isnâ€™t that stupid right?
god i just need to graduate and then i can get the hell out of this country
What the fuck
Like congratulations, your own government is now run by clowns who have no idea how to even do money or government
revolution is the only way out. and thatâ€™s not going to work for many reasons.
we have - it did shit in 2020 its not going to fix things now
like literally. if nothing changes to prevent him taking office. which I doubt will happen but we have until january. BEST case scenario is he just pardons himself and his term is just like 2016.
Vance is likely a grifter given how much his views have changed since 2016  and Trump is a true believer in his own cult 

I do think Vance would still do immeasurable harm to the country but honestly anyone over Trump.
but yeah my thoughts about a vance presidency is that it would be just as bad at trump BUT it could be over in 2028. maybe.
what the fuck lmao???
the worst part is itâ€™s marketing itself as free education
why do none of the tomlinson outlets work
So heâ€™ll only have executive orders and things will be worse but manageable
If we lose the House we may be cooked
I donâ€™t have a back up school that isnâ€™t community college
its terrifying that all of these college educated people want to rip that away from the younger generations
is education supposed to trickle down too or something?
Itâ€™s so short sighted I cannot fathom the backwards logic and thought that went through this
I would think a large voting block for trump in the younger demographic come from working class and non-college educated who feel alienated from economic and foreign policy thatâ€™s largely guided by people with degrees
This one hurts to see becuz itâ€™s a horrific objectifying of people into nothing more tools, which for me is such a demoralizing thing to see
the democratic party is incapable of platforming a woman who isnâ€™t tied to a previous male president and is incapable of presenting a progressive platform. it gambled on stealing moderate republican voters by displaying themselves as rational centrists who actually do care about the issues trump wants them to care about, but in reality those people wonâ€™t listen to them because theyâ€™ve been told not to by their own echo chamber. who they really catered to was moderate liberal voters, shifting the overton window rightward, while providing their progressive base with a feeling of betrayal and apathy.
Heâ€™s pissed and I get that honestly
we have tomorrow. we have next week. we have next month. we donâ€™t have next year.
Except death is also slowly creeping in for many as everyday life more than just a symptom of unfortunate randomness or the passage of time
Chat we gotta do something we can't just sit and let them do this to us
Honestly though, what can we do?
there isnâ€™t anything we can do
Weâ€™re effectively powerless outside of peaceful protests but even that wonâ€™t work for people who donâ€™t give a flying fuck
and it needs to be all of those things
But we also can't get violent with the protesting because that's what caused the antiwar movement to fall apart during the Vietnam war
we just have to hold out till 2028 till that fucker trump canâ€™t even do jack shit and we get new blood in the white house
but thatâ€™s the toughest shit to date
hate to break it to you but.
I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s gonna happen.
not gonna help either
Why did the bullet miss.
I would say the answer is to do our best at a local level. but we screwed that up too. no issue 1. no sherrod brown. idk what happened with all the other ohio races.
That was awful timing too, July was when some rapid changes happened too. A perfect timing for people to start moving around
the local level also doesnâ€™t help when the supreme court is a trump card
doesnâ€™t mean we shouldnâ€™t try
in all likelihood, this election means the Supreme Court is gone from a left wing political perspective. It's about to be 7-2 conservative, possibly worse depending on who dies
And hope thereâ€™s still enough gas in the tank after this hell for better changes to occur and come back to balance
we can hope that even the current level of reality denial and propaganda canâ€™t justify all the atrocities, devastation, and chaos that will come to trumpâ€™s own voters as a direct result of his policies.
the sheer fact we have to get through this expensive ass school under this manâ€™s control is making me think iâ€™m not gonna be able to live even after i graduate
let alone graduate
God all I wanted was to have a silly fun time getting my degree guys
without protest
which i doubt is fucking none
if they happen
because of this shit
ahem

â€œwe can hope that even the current level of reality denial and propaganda canâ€™t justify all the atrocities, devastation, and chaos that will come to trumpâ€™s own voters as a direct result of his policies.â€
why canâ€™t we go back to obama bro
like after elon guts the faa Iâ€™m never flying on a plane again
it canâ€™t be understated that weâ€™re royally screwed on all fronts and at the end of it is just a brick wall of planetary level doom
I wish memes relating to presidents were just weird but not hinting anything sinister
oh I forgot ai
The wretched fucking technology of generated text from stolen work
after last night
all we need to do
which is so fucking hard to think of
but we just need to hold out
Someone said it last night idk who but this is an actual fucking Star Wars palpatine moment
Except instead of being terrifying and cool itâ€™s just terrifying
how are we supposed to live on like this
i donâ€™t even understand how kamala *didnt* get enough attention
We either live to fight another day or we die and surrender others to a worse fate
meanwhile trump is sitting inside his bulletproof clear box
The switch from Biden was awfully timed and late
last christmas
Bro itâ€™s my birthday in two days I didnâ€™t want to spend it like this
we need john yakuza more than ever now
Just one and a half months
i hope they dont concede
Worst thing for Democrats is that the race wasnâ€™t even close
this isnâ€™t palpatine, this is Look Whoâ€™s Back
anyway. trump did the same as he did in 2020. kamala did worse than biden in 2020. Iâ€™ve heard that most of the votes missing are white suburbian men registered democrats.
ive just been sitting in the lgbt center but im prob gonna  sit by the lagoon after my next class
Thatâ€™s fair
Too tired for sugar, sorry
20 million votes don't disappear for no reason
idk maybe it is kamalending
and her campaign sucked partially bc the democratic party was a bunch of idiots trying to have biden run again
gonna start playing the lottery if i become a millionaire laws dont apply to me anymore
Yeah, I don't think there is a conspiracy here, I think that there was just low turn out among democrats, and then there were people who didn't fill out the top of the ballot as a protest
it's just a shame that so few people turned up
yea her campaign was awful sadly
Idk about that
I think she was taking the democrat votes for granted and trying to run up the numbers with independents in swing states where polling showed that the most important issues being the economy and immigration, but the problem is you can't beat Trump at that game, and that polling over simplifies things and catering to it makes her feel cynical and not genuine
to be fair she also didn't have the time to do everything so she tried to minmax it and that was very apparant to voters unfortunately
i have no clue why they tried to run biden for so long
But like honestly it's kind of an impossible game, because that is basically the strategy that Biden used in 2020 and it worked. 

And I think Harris ran a much better campaign then Clinton all things considered and it still wasn't enough
that's what made it so off, like the timing COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE
biden would have lost
bad
biden does even worse tbh
dems just didnt learn anything and thought that â€œwe arent trumpâ€ was a good enough campaign or smth
but it isnt
its insane that basic human rights arent convincing enough to people
or "it wont happen to me so i dont care"
The avg person is woefully ignorant about how laws, government, and the economy work
literally have latino friends with family saying "i came here illegally but i work so he wont deport me"
â€œthe one who hates immigrants most is the immigrant who made itâ€
i can't even follow that logic jesus
surely it cant happen to me right!
the worst thing about the leopards eating people's faces party is that sometimes people really don't care if the leopards eat their face, so long as the other guys get their faces eaten too.
lowkey all politics does is make me want to crumple into a corner and question how the fuck we even society enough for me to have a plate of food and a phone
Itâ€™s literally this except the diarrhea won
Sad part is that the race was nowhere near that close
we need new blood
It seems then that the party is back to square one
Yayyyy (I hate that)
one of my professors asked if there was an exam today
fair
jrue clears unfortunately
cant believe RFK is gonna be in charge of healthcare
Wtf
chat i need to stop taking 4 hour naps

I donâ€™t have immediately pressing hw
Iâ€™m working on both Spanish and German
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
Iâ€™d say you donâ€™t need to
I didnâ€™t
If you think you donâ€™t need insurance, thereâ€™s no need
What happened on the binary walkway???
what did happen
did something happen
They closed it off
I couldnâ€™t find any signs as to what itâ€™s about
but I can guess. someone getting the protesting out before university is incentivized to shoot us for it at risk of getting sued.
Idk what happened
not really a protest, just vandalism
It definitely was intended as some form of protest. The question is how effective was it, and the fact that we donâ€™t know is a good indication that it got stopped rather early and didnâ€™t meet its goals
I dont think it lasted very long
Idk I just joined this chat
I didnâ€™t see anything at the law school but I was also very distracted walking to class today
Idk the entire message
idk what the rest said
and immediately leo is already mentally gone
Did they spell Palestine wrong💀💀
Idk man
Nah Iâ€™m actually gonna do it for serious
i hate you
SOMEONE GETS ME
SHIT IS SO DRY AND HAS MID ASS TEXTIRE
cold cut turkey is good
sounds like yall are having the worse part of the turkey
It keeps thanksgiving bearable

Never been to it yet
iâ€™m not even at school yet

Idk I remember it being big in 2018
WHATS WRONG WITH SPOTIFY
Mr. Binary just doesnâ€™t like music
The app just sucks
oh i just hack mine to work and it works
you shouldnâ€™t have to hack it to get it to work 😭
Okay tho Spotify wrapped is the reason why I use Spotify
rip
We also have this which spotify is just turning into ewaste at the end of the month which i hate it
they ainâ€™t mariah carey
mariah isnt a queen
fair
What the fuck
Bro this exam was horrendous and I still did better than I did on the first one
What the fuck are these teachers smoking
78 IS A FUCKING A?
give me this. plus my high schoolâ€™s rule that you canâ€™t get lower than 50% on an assignment
Im gonna die next semester in that class
Itâ€™s not hard
this curve is a fucking lifesaver
Tho itâ€™s also cuz Fernando is unbelievably based
I cannot get the padoruâ€™s out of my head now
donâ€™t try and bargain with leo
Whatâ€™s wrong with a little bit of irradiation
nobodyâ€™s going to miss a little chunk of texas
Thereâ€™s just so much of it
Who wants to watch 38 minutes of insanity
i miss these
and it was cuz my flight to prague got fucked over lmao
the shmear should never be disrespected
im bored
maybe there was more we didn't see. when I passed the law building there was a bunch of stuff scrawled on the ground that I couldn't make out. but also.
though I think it was probably the bloody handprints. iirc there was a previous incident where that sort of thing was cited as antisemitic by cwru.
my schedule for next semester is gonna SUCK
Agreed wtf lmao
except math 122 but that would conflict with physics
i need an easy fifth class that has no work
it was a hell of a lifesaver for me last year
how much work is there
how much work is there
awww
i still get every other thursday off
how much can there REALLY be
oh 💀
it seems that the theme of today is "these times are so polarizing that in order to get the full picture of anything you have to actually look at both sides no matter how much you dislike it, because neither will provide all the information, and then synthesize what actually must have happened from all of that"
oh shit
sad i can't catch the first two showings but for some reason they're putting on a third one so~
didnâ€™t have my phone on me lol
damn no activity now
Damn
everyoneâ€™s either sleeping in
first off wtf is this
like wtf
I feel itâ€™s gotta be posted by someone from this server, as I feel no one else would think of the Tham v Arnav combo
doesn't sound like it
I really have no clue tbh
but seriously the hillel vs. sjp thing is. SUCH a bad take.
shit is crazy
and that all nursing majors are bad or something
we don't fully know
Idk him personally but he's in my psych class apparently, I've also chatted with him a bit now on here
Also omg I need to check out Sidechat because wtf
you want to come to top gun tn
Too tired
Iâ€™ve practiced for over 2.5 hours straight today on violin
Well it has been but worse since then I think

Leo I think you need help
No idea who you are but nice to meet you Aiden (sorry if I spelled your name wrong)
@_epip You missed out on a lot
There was also Leo with cat ears but I couldn't ss it on time
Bye bye Clarisse
apparently we can get free nitro from CWRU by participating in this server?
oh what the
idk
leo trying to do work
My head hurts again
I think I need tylenol
Bruh the only thing that makes my head stop hurting is sugar 💀
all problems go away
thats what jesus said before he died
Although I did just eat like 2 desserts in a row so I don't think my blood sugar would drop that fast
Idk actually
maybe you didnt have enough dessert
leo is trying to fix his sleep as hes been severely sleep deprived for the past week
please help him stay accountable and sleep earlier today
didnt know you were into loli-kami....
oh......
I have no idea what that is but I think I may be lucky I don't
I am very surprised you donâ€™t
nono you need to be blessed with this garbage
bad ending vs good ending
i don't watch vtubers... too much low mental thought processing
Sorry to hear that, I hope you will recover soon

Wtf
i have it but i havent played yet 😭
I only have Three Houses yet, but I've only played the Blue Lions route (I spent over 110 hours on it)
oh woahh
Yeah this is not normal for someone playing it on normal mode (I am shit at strategizing)
@mudrocker lost his 50/50
idk what happens 😭
Leonie decided at the last second ||she didn't want to die||
oh
now i know how dylan feels.....
Oh rip
I'm stu dying and cannot comprehend my CS reading
IM JUST TRYING TO DRAW
i am no longer tragically competing with adam for the lightning pfp for a higher enlightenment
It must be in the left
what you see milliseconds before death
THE FUCK LMAOOO
ã‚ï½ƒã¤ã‚l fucking chaos in vc
omg the clarke prison walls
i'm tragically no longer competing with adam
type alan and you should find me i have a tbhk pfp on insta too
Zach and I are bad influences on each other
If I can sell and ship off my old PC from here
Idk how to send packages and shit though tbh 💀
Per school year I believe
theres a fedex store nearby i think?
fedex i frogor why but i wasnt able to ship from there
but they made posters for me :3
maybe they just didnt like you
Martinis apparently
I hate den
den fell off
Youâ€™re getting the wrong things
i like, dont eat meat tho\
DAMN
mine was 4 pages and i got 67/70 for the lab
we do our labs a week earlier
Just counted and had 18 pages 💀 Don't do whatever the hell I did
Idk 😭
I think I typed down most of the math
It's also double-spaced but idk if that contributes much
Well this was for lab 5, i havent done lab 6 yet
That would make it longer by a lot
For like the work and plugging in numbers and such
just general equations without subbing in variables and stuff
i hate you
I DIDNT SAY THAT
im so sorry anders
the pain is evened out by the fact i wrote mine in one sitting
mine was four pages and got 70/70 so
this class is so lenient that I keep cutting corners knowing I can take the points lost and then I just. don't lose the points.
Would anyone have happened to take a picture of the board for lab 5v
We need a dedicated homework help channel lol
wtf happened to the moon guys
Excuse me what the fuck lmao
sadly no
leo wtf
Iâ€™m sure someone in the class
took one
i can do whatever i want
I just need to channel the energy of every artificer character Iâ€™ve played in d&d
As someone whoâ€™s never played d&d, consider being an unhinged summoner
I tried it once. the campaign died.
ill cry
I donâ€™t waste food lmao
Or if someone takes it theyâ€™re eating it
holy shit Chris butler was on a unicycle today
Does a man need any other reason?
leo wtf pt 2
never
do it you wont
Do we need a coding background to use this?
corporate wants you to find the difference between these two pictures
I dont work with Alpha Fold, but to my knowledge youre going from primary peptide structure to tertiary/quaternary using AI predictions, so i think you should just need AA sequence, but you probably need some sort of fundamental comp sci to interpret data and set parameters.
Didnâ€™t know there was also a group me
do it you wont
The space between coffee house and linsalata is called that cause someone got murdered there!
Wtf
donâ€™t give leo any ideas
They found a body with stab wounds
Right at the start of last year
I have not heard this, not saying it's necessarily untrue, but I have heard of multiple violent crimes near campus over the last few years...  someone stole a student's car at gunpoint near the village, and shot the student in the foot.
There was a drive-by shooting between two cars outside Plum at some point, a campus employee had their phone and wallet robbed at gun point and then they attempted to chase the guy, who then fired warning shots. 

And I have not heard of the murder alley
For some reason I have a package that was left in the Crawford mailbox
The fuck
Can someone explain how this math worksâ€¦. Like I put this in a calculator and I get -167
Shit does happen but most deaths on campus are tragic accidents, not intentional murders
Injuries/thefts do happen, as toby mentioned some
Can we make a chat for homework help?
i always ate at the brb until the first week of this semester when i legit got food poisoning from there
had to go to bio class but i couldn't walk :landed:
Imagine your food poisonings being that bad
@mykokorobrokoro @mism0937 bring a buddy to mega salamance in 30 if want
we only have two of them, donâ€™t miss it
Iâ€™m in class
havenâ€™t launched yet
thereâ€™s still time
IM COMING FROM BINGHAM WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO PEE
they tried to launch it and nothing happened
I think I followed instruction 3 wrong 😭
does anyone perchance have the drew meyer slide w the topics for wednesdays exams?
oh.
why r spartie q and late night not open yet
they said spartie isnt accepting orders
im here and hoping
my order still has half an hour left lol
mine has 78 minutes
rip
without waiting? lmao
feels wrong
but saves. ten minutes. and I have work to do.
fuck matlab
I hate how discussions are on Tuesday cause it takes away time Iâ€™d rather use to study
i fucking hate the progress check (tho these past few units overall have not been fun at all)
I think the move tomorrow is retake notes, past exam, and his zoom problems
i've already retaken notes they didn't help lol beyond giving me light understandings
I need to really just put my phone away and lock in
you know what i do not care that my aleks pie is a wreck the next aleks isn't due till 11/28
@roguish_raven since you were wondering, my advisor said thereâ€™s only around 8 of us since usually theres 2 per year
I lost my pencils case 😦 if anyone sees an orange monster pencil case could you please let me know!
i fucking hate this class
(exam 3 answer key)
Leutner, I think. I just don't know where in that building 😦
does anyone know how they got this? i'm subtracting and multiplying shit and it aint mathing
Hope for it on the exam
Just cause
I just panicked because my phone wouldnâ€™t fetch my notes app notes while low power mode was on
Do we have to know sn1 v sn2 for chem exam
idk
Not in a chem course currently but nucleophilic reactions are when the bond between a carbon something else is broken prompting the carbon to bind with a new nucleophile right?
Shit
never heard of her
Iâ€™m bad at idioms
Nvm I can't find them 😭
Iâ€™m pretty sure that it isnâ€™t supposed to be on the test
Idk tho
i don't think we need to work on that tho v much cuz it's not part of our discussion worksheets...
not your fault dont sweat it lol
Exam 3 just has quantum mechanics thrown in
bitch what the FUCK do you mean
it wonâ€™t be on the exam
I wonder if in Sn1 the leaving group leaving is the slow step because you need energy to break that bond
some other quantum things are that quantum theory helped explain black body radiation and the photoelectric effect.

with black body it was some weird math thing where treating energy as continuous made stuff go to infinity

and the photoelectric effect is basically where light knocks electrons off of material, which it shouldnâ€™t do if itâ€™s a wave.
chem 111 peeps how are we feeling
Iâ€™m in many rooms everyday lma
I donâ€™t have a test tmrw tho
Worst decision of my life
She's that bad huh
She really is
fuck the up shut
cuz orch is performing the alma mater on friday
Do you have a bowl cut
This Leo in a bowl cut would be wild ngl
i'd rather die than do that
I donâ€™t use instabmuch tho
or have signifcantly longer hair cuz i actually enjoy having my hair slightly longer cuz im a martial arts stereotype
i know lmao, just wanted to get as wrong of a jet as possible lol
tho maybe they're just AC-130s in disguise
omg is that a stealth cessna
holy shit yes
HOT DAMN
the planerot goes hard
Chem 111 people, do we need to know the Boltzmann Equation?
I think Iâ€™ve gotten an overall understanding of this but Iâ€™m trying to get this all down further than just â€œroughlyâ€
elon is legitamately the worst
what the fuck
stellic and every university website is the most dog shit designed interface with incompetent infrastructure that cant even manage a busy day
bold of you to assume i've even read the slides yet
let alone the procedure
We need to make our own procedure
tf is this shit
Thereâ€™s probably some calculation for that
I donâ€™t see that on the slides tho
Iâ€™ve combed through these slides too many times to know thereâ€™s nothing
except i never did a titration (was supposed to but my titration day fell on a snow day)
honestly it was less directly caused by covid bc they had too many people taking the class because they admitted a larger class than they could handle bc of covid
Because nothing indicates that
Still by Covid either way
people who took it in the fall (i took in spring) still had to do lab every week
Idk what part 2 is
okay I'm ready for chem 1111 exam
mine was hard and scary
Oh
again hard to recall
you also get choices for questions. like itâ€™s not doing the whole exam. thereâ€™s like. sections where you pick two of 3 or 3 of 5 to answer
and one of them was part of a titration which i hadnâ€™t done since sophomore year of high school so i didnâ€™t get as much of a pick
i still have my aspirin-
idk what to do with it
Idk how bro
That shouldnâ€™t be physically possible
i mean iâ€™ve disproved several universal constants in physics labs this year so
i asked zoey the next week and she told me to still keep it
I literally broke the law of conservation of mass
aint no way i'm paying for a "lost" vial
itâ€™s ok it doesnâ€™t compare to the time i broke glassware and i did the entire lab with a cut in my finger that i didnâ€™t know about
i broke one of the most expensive ones donâ€™t do that kids
Left all mine at home 🥲
had to pay the stockroom like $70 cause i also broke a thermometer
mine wasnâ€™t really my fault bc they gave us bad instructions
i presume they don't have Hg right?
yeah they donâ€™t
i also broke one in 215L
Donâ€™t you mean hydrargyrum?
they said we needed to twist  something on when it could just sit bc of frosted glass, i tried getting it on and *crunch*
thermometer was my fault tho i take the blame
i dropped the thermometer, the other thing just broke in my hands
i have not broken anything since
Well Leo wonâ€™t
yeah i don't have to do chem labs
im not doing a triple major i'm already too tired half the time lmao
fuck no
Iâ€™m going to sleep and Iâ€™m not opening my ALEKS till the weekend
I thought I heard chris butler say "moo wife" during math class today
Weâ€™re starting in a few minutes
okay that was definitely my worst exam
thatâ€™s like the one thing I never got down
not confident in anything equilibrium though
my other exams are good enough.
Iâ€™m just hoping itâ€™s consistent ish with my other exams and not terribly low
if mine is consistent with my other exams Iâ€™m smooth sailing
sam wtf
worst exam take
we just need to do well on the final and this doesnâ€™t matter at all
unless you failed all three exams. then thereâ€™s next year.
and that was the last full paper, right?
now time to get back to working on my ksp pickup truck
OMG SPORE WAS SO PEAK
this thing is definitely up there in worst rockets I've built. just look at how it tapers off to the upper stage then widens again.
but you can definitely do worse
KSP: the average nerds wet dream of doing physics and aerospace without doing all the actual nightmarish work lmao
so valid though
reminds me of how itâ€™s becoming more cost effective to put older people on a cruise ship instead of a retirement home for a year
that moment when you feel caught up on your work
fastest class enroller in the west, third year in a row
I thinks that you when you came down for Asian test
For those of you who have done the harmonic motion lab, was your torsion modulus value to the 10th power? Mine is but I can't tell if that is really really off
lol nothing because 312 overlaps phys 121; everything else is on the cancer bio track or interfering; i did most electives before hand like BIOL 343; BIOL 326; and a few inf disease path courses
POV: the Rockefeller doors nearly fucking kills you
I donâ€™t wanna think about that
Why would they invite us when we old tho
They miss us
They want us to come home
In all honesty idk though, but I think the signs in the atrium had like 25 and 50
I can't remember tho
was it a good idea to not actually verify that there's no aleks due today until 11pm? no
is there an aleks due today? no
No aleks on exam week, rest easy soldier
Who the fuck is tripping the alarm
Itâ€™s 5 am and I want to sleep
I HATE CLARKE 🤗🤗
BRO WHAT THE FUCK
Like Iâ€™ve tripped smoke detectors before but that was only cuz the detector itself was in a bad spot and defective, and after several hours of making confectioneries
😭 
someone was trying to make popcorn and forgot it in teh microwave adn it burned
it smells terrible up there
What the fuck
Someone better theyâ€™re responsible for waking up like 300 people at 5AM
I almost didn't belive it was set off untill I opened my door and was assulated by smoke
and as I said yesterday when my buildingâ€™s alarm went off, if I were a firefighter I would not want to work near a college
another downside would be students not leaving the dorms when the alarm goes off because of teh ammount of fake alarms
I almost missed music theory today and I had to redo a keyboard assignment cuz of the wretched rat that tripped it last night
still trying to find that one
Itâ€™s above me tho
Not to mention I can get away with writing random stupid shit on the board
I borrowed a non clarke residents marker and for some reason within an hour of entering the 11th floor radius the marker died
THE PAIN OF SUBMITTING ALEKS 3 MIN BEFORE THE DEADLINE WAS NOT NEEDED WTF
did you. do it last night?
i just woke up oh my god
missed two classes
Why the fuck is phys 121 so empty
Iâ€™m here for shits and giggles cuz of Alex but itâ€™s so damn empty compared to 122
Phys 122 how we feeling about this test
Unfortunately I donâ€™t :(
He said it would be this Friday but idk
I didnâ€™t get my score yet so weâ€™ll see
oh yeahhhh
@brokenbladeofmystery last lab next week!!!
arenâ€™t there two more
nope!
the worksheet is due IN the lab
I can help with it tho cuz I think I have a p strong understanding of E&M
is copi a good or bad one
Idk
the rate my prof looks good so im not worried but
I think fernando for 122. I heard it's his last semester though.
124 only has copi unfortunately
His hw is hard but itâ€™s easier to manage studying for his tests and quizzes
im in 123 rn and i actually kind of like going into depth about stuff other than the general mechanics subjects so its sort of just my wish to continue that
I wouldâ€™ve realistically taken 124 but they donâ€™t offer it in the fall, and I need to try and max out my credits as much as possible every semester so
what j happened
or rather, itâ€™s still happening
god jake paul is so fucking punchable
Yeah I've been debuffed with short stature
i want to see the height comparison between clarisse and i
I feel like I have but it also could've been the other Muhsin
Idk
I talked them outside of school during a retreat
so it definitely wasnt me
the floors above me in clarke makes me want to throw myself out of clarke tower
Iâ€™m gonna mcfucking lose it
rip clarke tower
I MISSED IT NOOOO
Why is it bad
So your cycle didnâ€™t matter
They just wanted to not have their website crash
Idk how foolproof this is tho
The opposite of shake is still
youre still only showing that the opposite of shake is still but not hte opposite to milk
I refuse to live in this reality. Your wrong
you still have not incorporated the opposite to milk
if u associate meaning into an object past its regular definition then you can certainly find opposites
â€œOne cheese still with a side of English frozens pleaseâ€
war could be a verb tho
i mean certain nouns dont have an opposite traditionally (what is the opposite to tree?) but reasonably anything can have an opposite if you apply a set of definitions to it
My band director from high school would always say the opposite of hate isnâ€™t love but indifference, but I feel like thatâ€™s wrong
Huh so like we canâ€™t find an opposite of a word only if the English language doesnâ€™t have the word
We donâ€™t have the opposite to the word â€œtheâ€ bc itâ€™s not in the language
Well passion is strong feeling for soemthing while indifference is no feeling for something, two different sides of a spectrum
but you can still think of passion as a strong *positive* feeling, and indifference as a lack of feeling, which still appears as not truly opposite. i see what u mean and i think passion and indifference are opposite in nature its just interesting to think abt
does anyone know what happened in taft / is everyone who lives in taft alr
what happened 😭
yo what happened
What happen
uh oh
isn't that 4 trips in the past 48 hours (3 from clarke, 1 from taft)

bruh stop burning shit
I DONT COOK SHIT HERE LMAO
@reefrider i cooked your mother tho
I realized I can't go but I really don't want to be locked out of registering for classes lmao
Did you end up getting that code
does anyone who has taken math 201 know where the classroom is? i'm trying to decide if a 15 minute gap after a rockefeller class is safe
i would imagine math 201 is also in the quad or nearby
have u taken math 201?
ah rip
No unfortunately
They are both on Thursday tho 👀
Nah I was able to get one for Tuesday luckily
we only need to get 5 and 6 explorer credits in the next sem as the deadline
where do you find this
there's no fucking way
this is fucking bullshit
yeah no shit
this is fucking bullshit
Another thing is that you need to attend specific categories
it's still weird tho that yours didn't register at all for general credits tho
mf acting like i'm mad for no reason
and it's not allowing me to do shit now even though i've done what i needed to do
fucking bullshit
Omg itâ€™s snowing on Thursday
NOOOO I HATE SNOW
Wtf
Illinois never like this 💯
Nope we are part of the midwest
I live there wtf dym

Nope
Not worse?
Havenâ€™t been here long enough to judge

need to learn the entirety of this physics unit before friday
Donâ€™t be cooked

Do the cooking
Canâ€™t cook that good and ends up getting cooked
How does this happen
For me it lowkey doesnâ€™t matter if I lock in or not bc Iâ€™ll fail either way atp
Never
Like Iâ€™ve done everything in the past but it ainâ€™t enough
You got into this school for a reason
I need sleep
Guys why is the binary walkway closed again
idk
If you need to go to the quad just go through Adelbert hall from the side facing Adelbert Road
another bird shit and then die? 💔
I forgot to set my alarm set night, can anyone in math 124 please send the notes
Do you want me to wake you up on MWF at 8:00??
Fuck yeah
I need to do my phys lab
who needs ice charts
what the fuck is this
just fucking pour out my entire shampoo bottle on to my bed
ngl wish this was longer
Also unrelated but is coffee supposed to make you anxious
idk
I avoid coffee cause i donâ€™t like the taste and it stresses me out
i can't drink coffee without falling asleep even faster
Now I'm feeling the dread I used to feel before I get a shot when I used to vagel and almost pass out
wrong
Because it doesn't have a stomach or blood to carry nutrients to different parts of the body
Also the amount of applications open on my laptop rn is unreal
Wtf
okay i cant judge emails i have 14k lol
oh it's bad lmao
Someone could text you that someone died and you wont know 😭
if i dont text my grandma back i get yelled at
also i'm just bad at responding to messages in general so
unless they specifically call me out i dont respond
my mom hid that one of my favorite dogs growing up died for two weeks because i had midterms
i would lose my mind having that many notifs
i cant judge i have chipotle in mine lol
I donâ€™t use the app if Iâ€™m not on campus lmao
even though chipotle is everywhere
the chipotles back home have lost my trust
valid though the other week they ran out of chicken and steak and black beans 😭
Last time I had chipotle was in February when i was in San Antonioâ€¦
and then get mad when people walk up to order
charge your damn phone what are you doing
this actually happened to me at the gym
me when i was playing HvZ and smash into the ground so hard my water bottle is permanently dented from it
Front left bottom floor
I'm the loudest one, you can find me
That makes me want to eat chunks of my rosin
cause I edge
do it u wont
I DROPPED A CLASS
i completely forgot about it and am busy
I got pulled on a board and this guy just stood in the middle of the sidewalk as we went fast so I had to crash land
Ok Iâ€™m not saying we werenâ€™t also in the wrong, but normally you go left or right and not just stay in the middle when you hear / see fast moving vehicles
Then the reason we crash says â€œaaas a medical assistant I wouldnâ€™t recommend you do that, you could get hurt just like thatâ€
Aw man, sorry to hear that
Fair enough
Also Kyle Arnav didnâ€™t try walking to Schmitt right
I donâ€™t think he showed up though
So I was worried that he would come after the review for whatever reason
Been so for the past 2.5 hours
arnav is a fucking specimen
fret not, i will study with yall
This will be me after studying math
i swear tmrw morning im gna wake up and remember nothing
All you math 121/122 people got this tomorrow, believe in yourselves
math 121/22 folks
you're supposed to be positive ||even if they're all gonna fail anyways|| its about the illusion of hope
Haven't you heard? Delulu is the solulu
i need god to believe in me for this to work
math 121
oh im chilling i j have a massive migraine but cant not study
brother you wont remember anything
there is no point in studying anymore
but I need to memorize those mclaurin series for the 122 test
I think I'm good but don't want to get caught off guard
Wait the only thing we've gone over in Math 121 is the Riemann sums to the right side right
Not the left ones or middle ones
I hate having to do riemann sums because trapezoidal sums are just way better and easier
I am so fucking cooked for this physics exam
I basically need to learn everything we covered over the last month because none of it has stuck
everytime you talk about physics youre in the worst situation imaginable
i hate this error analysis euqation
idk if i need to do it but
Could be worse ngl
There is no "we're back" this time sadly
math?
have you not studied yet 😭
how many prayers yall need
I've been too busy writing up epic d&d content to study
ive been too busy worrying about work to do work
Iâ€™ve crashed out 4 times in the last hour
what do you work as?
Iâ€™m so fucked for math 122
like work for class
me too i missed the polar equation area lecture and i have no clue how to do it
chem majors how does this make you feel
sorry i am tweaking
chat i cannot do this anymore i cannot lie
i am giving up studying and going to sleep
mid november got me feeling like this
How many hours do we have until break again
Bros counting the hours 💀
Legit tweaking and can't take it anymore
lowkey dropped a class
Math tomorrow
I thought I would be more prepared but I was so wrong
i hate newton method and graphing
Lowkey miss English class (I won't as soon as I start AIQS tho)
Kaavya you missed so much
i shit u not i dont go to class half the time
It was one on the review sheet with someone named Pamela
oh!
no its a monday
Oh
long week huh?
sir its monday
That will make it officially 11 hours and 30 minutes until the math test
i wish for happiness and good vibes for you all
didnâ€™t we both say weâ€™d sleep now
yeah gn for real. I forgot to put away my laundry lol
Focus on studying, not on the amount of time more
go to sleep
Is it gonna snow on Thursday anymore
whatsapp message type shit
THERES GONNA BE SNOW THIS WEEK????
OMG
so i didnt know this
i miss snow so much
Apple weather isnâ€™t
So idk!
Omg Alan
Its the midwest, the weather is what you see outside, dont try to predict too hard
Northern Midwest weather moment
what is predictable weatherâ€¼ï¸
Itâ€™s not supposed to accumulate
Aw man :(
Itâ€™s rain and snow
Its gonna be raining
it happened when i was walking back from track practice
i was so mad
i was like why does the rain hurt
Wtf
Why dont the dryers work
I hate this place
i am no longer a psychic but i am gonna be manifesting at least one day of sunshine
Didn't the Cavs beat them
wishing everyone well this busy week
I canâ€™t help it
Chem 111 exam 3 scores dropped chat
oh.
ALL MATH PEEPS
DONT LOOK AT TOUR CHEM
Saw this and wanted to start laughing, I think my brain is officially fried for the night
I did better than i thought (says a lot about how i thought about the exam)
UNTIL YOU FINISH YOUR EXAM
ive taken too much psychic damage this week
Honestly tho why did he drop the scores so late at night
like it's neither impressive but not bad
Or early in the morning ig
can't I have too many essays or projects or exams coming up
its been a long week
i didnt know the submission was on the 20th
cuz im a hoarding gremlin
dw I don't know a single CS person who's even started it
Plus I think I might just download the LinkedList class from the notes because mine is on Notion and it's probably broken
THID WAS SOMRHOW MY BEST CHEM GRADE YET WHAT THE FUCK
idk how he does any of that tbh
(i say that as i do the same thing but worse)
idk then
i'm being so stupid rn and my brain isn't doing the resonant frequency correctly ;-;
He seems super cool tho
I'm impressed by his guts to even touch the water 😭 That stuff lowkey looks nasty
bruh my toothbrush fell on the floor
Rip
I mean i guess hes cool, idk, dont know much about him tbh
also the dorm water dispenser filter status has been orange for the past few weeks and I've been having a perpetual sore throat
Rip
too many of my friends are sick it might be over for me
me a week and a half ago
I swear everyone is getting sick then they get better then they get sick again
worst sickness I've had in a decade probably
worse than covid even 😭
Its just being close to so many people all the time, spreads fast
besides the beginning when i hung out with one of my friends in her apartment and she got me sick
my roommates gotten sick at least 4 times alr
i felt like death was approaching me for a day
math test tomorrow
im so stupid
I still need to do my lab report for shm
When's it due?
i rly dead ass forgot angular freq = normal freq times 2pi
I did the last report the day it was due and got a 60/60 Iâ€™ll be fine if i do that again
i donâ€™t know why on gods green earth yall still up like
few weeks back i thought i had a sore throat from allergies only for it to be covid that had me bedridden for a day :(
Reef you don't see anything
Isnâ€™t it 2 hours past your bedtime Anna?
i feel like iâ€™m gonna have to prescribe yall with melatonin
closer to 3 hours
im the only one who should be up lmao cuz i dont have a calc test later today lmao
I dont either
I donâ€™t
I was going to say if you don't sleep you won't grow taller but then I remembered my place
Not that hard
damn there are people smaller than clarisse?
Ik someone in my diff eq class who is
damn lmao
6â€™0 still growing
unfortunately
iâ€™m not even there yet
short
oh shit
okay there's one person i don't think anyone here is taller than that i know and that's one of the guys from kendo
like i can FEEL my neck scrunched back when i look up at him tall
yo i want a krabby patty now
Iâ€™m not taking a math this semester lol
one more part left chat
I woke up for class and got there earlier by a whole 2 minutes than usual
Ill take a nap later today thatâ€™s so fat that lard would feel like water
The internet has broken my humor, I saw m&m advertising the m&m tube on my Spotify and my mind went â€œthe cylinderâ€
Exam 2 was my lowest I think
gl to all the math 121/122 kiddos
Yo can I eat my lunch during the math test
Shit
Tho if I were you Iâ€™d grab smtg and walk and eat after the test
im gonna crash so hard after this test i had a redbull for breakfast
just realized I probably got one wrong because I stayed at n = 0 instead of n = 1
oh what 😭😭
I prob got the sum wrong then
my process should be correct though
that was the only one I didn't do
ran out of time
rip I should've known
so yeah the only ones I know I got wrong are the polar area one and the 1/(3^n - n)
just bc I couldnâ€™t remember the right test for it.
If it converges? I think you can reasonably show that 3^n - n > 2^n and then use direct comparison is how Iâ€™d approach it at least. Thereâ€™s probably an easier way but this seems like a reasonable option. 

In particular
3^2 - 2 > 2^2


3^(n+1)- n - 1 = 3(3^n) - n - 1 = 3(3^ n - n) + 2n - 1 > 3(2^n) + 2n - 1 > 3(2^n) > 2(2^n) = 2^(n+1) 
So 1/(3^n - n) < 1/2^n. clearly also bounded by 0, so convergent by direct comparison
Please donâ€™t waste the bannanabans
ok FW 16 users here, does your trackpad not click as correctly when you hold your laptop at an angle?
I have to try that out when I get back to my dorm in 2 hrs
Just tested mine. It's normal even while upside down
or maybe it was getting stuck v temporarily cuz it was slgithly cold?
idk

Well I picked a bad time to go near tink
Oh I forgot about that
Welp we tried lol
Not yet

i guess believing that civilians shouldn't be killed is antisemetic
damn
however rlly bad news has hit osu football  so idc as much
I need to get on that
theyre due next week...
you dont have to
i mean u also need to print them
like whole thing including adventurer is due monday
gl dude, mine took 3 hrs to cad
I already started them and they aren't too complicated
oh then I probably have until tuesday
Expect to spend many hours toiling on the hw each week tho
just have both, assembling is next weekâ€™s class
drew meyer is a god for making the exam last wednesday and not this wednesday. I would be very dead.
But the cold is so nice
I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll actually snow, like it says 0.05 inches
OH
BUT THE TEMP DIFFERENCE GONNA MAKE YALL SICK
If you havenâ€™t tried it yet you should. Good stuff
Slept in, my body felt like it was gonna collapse for a brief moment earlier today
Just havenâ€™t quite slept enough in the past few days
Iâ€™m gonna lock in for the remainder of today on calc and pray I can get an 80 on the test tmw
Fun fact: you can actually leave whenever you want, you just face the consequences
Breaking news: muhsin has fucking obliterated the sun
Bro was hungry
Fucking piece of dirt in my eye god dammit feels itchy
They ran out smh
Crying
My guess: 4 am
i then live on 4 hours of sleep
they are all for training I need to use the 3d printer
Sh*t, forgot that was today
oh
okay that was longer than I thought. within 15-20 minutes Iâ€™ll be back and send them.
sorry lol
yes, trap yourself in the elevator /j
(if you do it enough times it will make the elevator think its broken and not move)
Oh damn lmao
dont do it and waste someones time getting yo ass out
Dyk what happened to song of earth from Mahler
Bro why are there 4 peoples food here at leutner late night theyâ€™ve been closed for an hour
Not anymore
I wish it were snowing still
Itâ€™s the account that was banned tho
I should not be awake right now
for "letting me know about an important assignment I need to do at thinkbox" or some sleep depriving bs
someone mentioned christmas
christmas? only a week away...
only a week away
what the fuck
Has anyone taken eths251 with hickner
oh
God I got fucking flamed on the calc test
rip
how i feel as well
oh does 121 also have a test tomorrow
take my luck, if the way the last 123 test was graded is anything to go by, I wonâ€™t need it.
For the physics 121 people, do any of you guys understand the spool thing? Both the clicker questions and Z01 from the practice problems?
is that like the falling disc with a string wound around it problems
oh
idk
Just static I think to make it roll tho
I just can't figure out why
newton's second law: Î£F = ma
for rotational motion: Î£Ï„ = IÎ± (I is the moment of inertia)
tension force (T) acts to the right and friction force (f) acts to the left: Î£F = T - f = ma
tension force creates a clockwise torque and friction force creates a counterclockwise torque: Î£Ï„ = Tr - fr = IÎ±
torque Ï„ = Fr (where r = distance from axis of rotation to point of force application)
torque due to tension is greater than the torque due to friction because the moment arm (distance from axis of rotation) for the tension force is larger than the moment arm for the friction force
thus net torque is clockwise thus it rolls right
unironically i think it rolls left
I feel like it should roll left becuz the torque applied literally makes it roll CCW
I vaguely recall seeing this example as an unintuitive thing but I canâ€™t remember what the right answer is
I think it was that pulling it right makes it go left
You can test this rly easily too tho
Literally just curl up smtg soft and pull it towards you and it will uncurl itself away from you in an attempt to stay in place
thing is i think it would roll left if it was pulled at an upwards angle...but rolls left if pulled horizontally
tension force T acting horizontally to the right and creates a torque Ï„1 = T x r (counterclockwise)
friction force f from the table acting to the left and creates a torque Ï„2 = f x R (clockwise)
equilibrium condition for torques: T x r = f x R
thus friction force is related to the tension by: f = T(r/R)
F_net = T - f = T - T(r/R) = T(1 - r/R)
since R > r, we know that (1 - r/R) is positive, making F_net positive (pointing right)
if there was no friction, the spool would just slide without rolling
friction enables the rolling motion
it opposes relative motion at the contact point
yeah essentially then tension torque causes the spool to tend to rotate counterclockwise
so the bottom of the spool will slide to the right relative to the ground
since static friction acts to prevent slipping, it must point to the left to counteract this tendency
i think.....
this problem took me 3 tries and nearly an hour (i read it wrong and made it way harder on myself)
the assumption that the tension is small is likely important
r x T gives you a torque that tries to rotate it counterclockwise, which would make it seem like it wants to roll left

however note that there is also a frictional force at a larger radius, R. it can be assumed that f > T or at least R x f > r x T.

R x f is a torque making it rotate clockwise which makes it move toward the right
friction opposes the attempted direction to movement so if T is to the right and it wants to roll left then f is to the left trying to roll it right
though there was a page before this where I completely forgot about the 49x and had to start over
which adds a few steps on top of that and isn't even the right answer
i dont think you can simplify the motion to T = f; this would be true for pure translation
uhhhh a way to show this doesn't work given this assumption:
for translation: T - f = ma
for rotation: Tr - fR = IÎ±
for rolling without slipping: a = Î±R 
as you said, by substituting T = f:
Tr - TR = IÎ±
T(r-R) = IÎ±
this can't be right because if T = f, then a = 0, and if a = 0, then Î± = 0
if that's the case, this gives us T(r-R) = 0, which is impossible since r â‰  R

instead, you should consider that the **angular** acceleration to start is 0
thus Tr = fR
f = T(r/R)
[and so on](https://discord.com/channels/1198835515911327934/1198835636883431495/1309333762999451658)
fuck i'm done w physics 🥺 why am i doing this to myself
oh im blind af
Yeah and it doesnt specify rolling without slipping which is why i just went about T = f 

Which feels unintuitive tbh because your way - again- is favorable to think about the problem but i guess without the assumption we cant quite go about it that way
yeah given the lack of information about the rolling condition ig you cant assume a = Î±R 😮â€💨
also we lose info about Î± whfuehchiebxhe
Wait the ALEKS isn't due in 38 minutes right
no way u forgot
I'm gonna take 106 next semester tho
oh
Idk if I'll regret it later tho
do u need 145 for a bs in cs
Actually idk
nope
Engineering needs 145 yes
And no chem 111 has no aleks due tonight
stg you guys are AWFUL at keeping track of your hw and project due dates
Itâ€™s so damn long as a title lmao
still cant get over how dookie that was
it's so damn good
idk anything about it
i've heard of it before but not much else
doesnt she like take care of the dude living alone?
becuz it's clearly written to be nothing more than a literal cost saving measure, cuz fun fact, in japan, it can be more expensive to cook proper meals over convenience foods while still being the same amount of healthy
i've actually skimmed the light novel and i eventually plan on reading it properly (when i improve my japanese to be able to read a lot more kanjis without romaji), but it takes close to like 80 chapters in the light novel to get to that point they have an actual relationship where they're going out
vibes and they both agree to the financial part of it of paying half of it, and he does the cleaning of it
i dont think it's super popular in japan lowkey, when i went to japan, all i could find was a few bookstores selling the lightnovels in one small corner
what lindsey wants /j
i thought you wanted someone like douma
lindsey wants men who actually arent real
close nough
i just dont
cringe
unrealistic
cringe
and did i mention?
cringe
tho i may lowkey make others feel lonely lol
It all goes back to this
and that show is... a rather hard one for a first ever anime... especially while watching it with your ||ex who kinda ruined your mental health soooo||
fruits basket was aight
never bothered watching after the first season tho 😭
it's a very slow show but that's kinda the point of it, not rly meant for binging thru like an action anime, more like telling a story with multiple moving parts all at once
it doesnt' rly come along till the end
if it doesnt make me cry then i dont want it :3
its short
45 minutes
movie
I FELL ASLEEP WATCHIGN IT
tho it does require understanding of the whole show before it of rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai
i wanted to watch dreaming girl but idk why i didnt watch it
just takes the god damn cake
i remeber when it came out on digital i had an exam season
so i jsut never got to it
sigh
then the 5th is apparently caused Rascal does not dream of santa claus
which sounds like a fever dream
THEY NEED TO STOP-
"knapsack kid" WTF
the title sounds so much worse than it should
Whatâ€™s wrong with that? 🤨
who the fuck is talking here when they simp on the arguably most hatable character in demon slayer
wrong
no hate only love here
it's more accurate to call it a school bag from what she's carrying so
@wanningswontons get fucking outvoted here
i didnt say it was *bad*
School bags
i really need to watch fruits basket
limit yourself to just a few episodes per reading or watch session, cuz it's a very slow burn of a show
isnt there like 75 episodes
aw man
put it on in the bg while working so the animation didnt phase me
i have thought about reading the manga but my friend keeps on glazing so i just never did
he's the reason i didn't drop bl s1
im so glad no one has tried to come up with shit like that
HOLY SHIT
okay tho lowkey underrated manga i found recently
i aint hear anything about his personality from u
oh he's kind of a piece of shit
that doesnt matter though
toxic poor revenge thirsty guy
he needs the biggest ego
i just remmeber him hitting those crazy ass curved shots with the water effects and shit
I think the system will get mad at you. Just have the back up in your cart just in case
FUCK
I GOT THE CPR/FIRST AID CLASS
im really salty
I GOT WHAT I WANTED
I couldnâ€™t get into psych
gotta say this is probably the worst enrollment semester bc we're last picking but we're not just all shoved into the same giant freshman lecture classes.
I HATE SIS
I HATE SIS
I HATE SIS
I HATE SIS
I HATE SIS
I canâ€™t go back to sleep until 7:30 😭
I will never forgive them for the way they planned bio labs during last enrollment
Yay...I guess?
the one math class I got starts at 8:25
Wtf
ive gotten all my STEM classes so far
mf is about to experience the out of body experience that is a 12 hour day
my fucking god
math 122 at 9:30 had only one spot left
thereâ€™s math 122 at 9:30?
oh is that the discussion section
This is awful
people out here crying about having to take a few 8:25 classes that attendance isn't super mandatory for
THURSDAY USED TO BE MY SLEEP IN DAY
thatâ€™s not too bad
itâ€™s all driscoll isnâ€™t it
also hope your equipment doesn't malfunction too
lab isnt a problem
WHAT THE FUCK ITS LIGHT OUT
also why the fuck does each lecture for phys 121 only have 28 seats per lecture
I HATE THE SUN
lowkey the equipment suck so much the tolerances are wack
all the TAs for phys 123 legit didnt care about the error 😭
pull it to the left then right (or vice versa)
ouch
if anyone's looking for breadth (A+H) that's still open and / or wants local and global engagement credit, ORBH 320 is still open with 31 seats!
I got the blinds closed tysm 🙏
That is the worst reason
I TRIED to sleep
if you attend class that is
leo I hate the suspense
Your stomach is half full and half empty until it is opened
kyle I hate waiting for classes
that sounds like you're gonnna rip my stomach open to figure that out
BRO ITS SO STUPID
TBH I ALMOST DIDNT 😭
Noooo donâ€™t
I want bed sleep, but I am denied it
dude go to bed early tonight
i just gotta study for the final at this point and pray i get an a
I have 2.5 hours of eng 130 classes every tuesday
One isn't
i have 2.5 hours of ENGR 145 plus another hour of engr 130 on tuesday
it wont be that bad
but if you already know how to code it's pretty brain dead
though I do not want to know how many points I've lost for not using the designated comment format for all my functions
Do I ask for a regrade on the math test because I got points off for accidentally swapping the problems (I did end up indicating that I swapped them, although maybe not explicitly enough) or do I give up
It wouldnt hurt
Iâ€™m gonna be so fr I donâ€™t know what sekai means
I didnâ€™t know drew meyer actually screams clicker question go
@mudrocker showing up astronomically late today
Leo looking mad different today
if only this wasnt a 7 pm class
i'd  take it if it wasnt at an abysmal time
400 level video games & US war industry class looks so fucking based
i need to take
but i cannot find a 5th class
iâ€™ve taken one every semester since my sophomore spring
oh yk what
i didnt even notice it was once a week
i cant find him on rmp
shame
Lol. Sophomore year is worse. Sorry to break it to you
once a week 7 pm class or twice a week astronomy class
i need to take 6 classes because im only getting 9 credits this sem
Isnâ€™t the minimum u have to take is 13
so i need to take 18
so im going to end up getting 9 and taking 18 next sem to get the 27 req
18 is still in the range of sane credit totals
I donâ€™t like ruth milne
I presume you didnâ€™t get into 222L?
of course the one homework problem I paid attention to was on the test
BRO I HAVE SHIT TO STUDY FOR WHY NOW 😭
yea it seems broken rn
It jusr went down for me
it was working like 5 min ago when i was on ot
I guess this just happened
guess i'll fail my exam
mine is working but iâ€™m also not on campus rn
Mine just came back up
That's to be a sophomore by credits, I don't think you necessarily need that to advance in the first place but could be wrong
THATS WHY THEY DIDNT RESPOND
THEY NEVER EVEN GOT IT
uh oh
Fair enough but I don't wanna be a sophomore and not be a sophomore at the same time
Insane I thought since they didn't tell people when they accepted the credits they wouldn't tell people if they didn't accept them too
But no they just never got it somehow
Trying 18 credits isn't impossible or anything, but if 12 was treating you rough this semester then it may not be any better
Nah it wasn't that 12 was treating me bad
I learned the hard way
Math and cs aren't for me
Agreed, Iâ€™m considering pass/no passing calc 3 rn sooo
and Iâ€™m still trying to figure out completely how to balance stuff
Don't bother p/np for a class you need for your major unless you're going to fail
Iirc it wont count toward requirements if you do that yea?
Oh fu-
If you p/np a class then you don't have it count towards the requirement to take the class, just your total credits to graduate (presuming you pass)
Long Tran, I donâ€™t rly like it
I am so sorry
Iâ€™ve never been the best at doing mathematics unless the teacher/professor was able to show some good tips and tricks for it and Tran doesnâ€™t do that
Fair
Tran doesnt like teaching calc III is what ive heard
But he just doesnt like calc III
Like reason I got a 5 on calc BC cuz my teacher in HS made sure we did only the hardest problems to ever exist and over prepared us, but Tran underprepares us imo and barely does the stuff I need
I took Tran for calc 3 and I thought he was a good professor, I think that managing a 100 person class is infinitely harder than a 30 person one. Also the secret is that no math prof really enjoys teaching calc/diffeq besides maybe Chris
@roguish_raven I was able to actually enroll!
remember if you didn't get a class, you can always submit a request. worst they can do is say no
Very nice to everyone who got the classes you wanted, and for those are still struggling, just remember that there are many roads to graduation, and the one you planned isn't the only one
bc my 8:30 am phys lab will prevent me taking julius diffeq if I pass the calc 3 proficiency exam.
Itâ€™s not like airplane food tho
oh slay me too
Idk the names
Unfortunately
at this rate I'll finish before I die
because I've written that section so many times and it's so confusing to work out. but I THINK I've got something going.
It did get taken eventually though
i swear i took mine
A salad with a bunch of croutons is just a bowl of cut up sandwiches
Because you didnâ€™t make crouton and vegetable sandwiches and then cut them up
I've been up for 20 hours 💀
why donâ€™t yall have some sleep
I want to sleep too Iâ€™m so tired
Iâ€™m tired, and my body hurts a little from kendo
Said by the man working on psych notes at 2:30am on a Saturday
Jokes on you my sleep schedule is already wrecked
+ i need to be up before 11
i forgot about my fantasy draft until too late so my team is hot ass
i don't even know who i drafted
so im either gonna cruise to the championship or end up below .500
didn't even realize i had sga
cp3 fell way off
insanely old to be fair
funniest shit i ever seen
*guttural internal screaming and crying intensifies*
who in the fuck writes 0.36 as 3.6*10^-1
I can't see his name without remembering arnav's horny crash out
if you don't know I envy you I wish i didn't see that
yeah no i don't wanna know
arnav isnt healthy
Yeah no shit
The issue wasn't even necessarily that. He just refused to stop when people complained that it was uncomfortable. Blatant disregard for boundaries. ugh
Oh thatâ€™s so stupid because on the pdf thing it says no daily limit
I also haven't been to BRB in years, they nerfed it when they got rid of taco bowl Tuesday
They donâ€™t even let you use two
I tried to get two slices of pizza last week and they yelled at me sadly
Doesn't have any apparent social skills
Omg what
i dont go anymore bc they legit gave me food poisoning first week of the semester
They need to change it on their pdf
Omg what was it that gave you food poisoning
i went once, got a sandwich that apparentlyyyyy wasnt included so it was like $17

Even if theyâ€™re raised humanely theyâ€™re still killed just for their flesh 😿
you didnâ€™t miss much
then again I wouldnâ€™t know. I was all but sleeping during class.
one of my friends texted me that this was the worst chem lecture of the semester so idk
Why did I have to end up in the stoner dorm
Someone in a room next to mine has been smoking daily for like 2 weeks
People really shouldn't be smoking inside of the dorms
I don't know who it is, that's the thing
i don't know the room number either lmfao
idk
Kerr was biased tho
He can fuck himself
the third movement is entirely normal and then the last note is engineered to sound as terrible and discordant as possible
fair
so close
Will finish tomorrow (itâ€™s due tomorrow)
color palette for what tho 😭
i don't even like coloring i just have them bc pretty
Out of curiosity, has anyone tried using the Hulu student deal with their Case account and did it work?

I thought that was you but wasnâ€™t sure
So I didnâ€™t say anything
I wasnâ€™t sure 😭
Missed opportunity
i bumped into jaeden, yechan, and max last weekend
Everytime i lock myself out of my room i lose a year from my life
alright looks like I'm taking ellis' card everyday so that they lock themselves out of their room.
Did u know you can unlock your room door with your phone through my housing
If you left your id in your room and you're still in the building
akrught im paying to see ellis eat a fucking door

GLOBAL WARMING ALREADY HAS MARIAH CAREY DEFROSTING EARLIER AND EARLIER EACH YEAR I DO NOT NEED FOR HER TO TAKE HALLOWEEN TOO
It's time to set your hour and half alarm to go to bed at a decent hour!
I am already tired of Christmas-posting lol
I've never been a Christmas celebrater, the holiday means nothing to me
I spend so little money itâ€™s scary
I have ate 1.4 meals today
I ate like 1.2 meals yesterday
Not eating > mental health is bad
Bad mental health > not wanting to eat
They compliment each other, yes, but they donâ€™t need to coexist
Mods kill this bot
Or trying to, my connection is so spotty I tried to delete the message and nothing happened
I think you successfully banned tho
Also just a heads-up, but there's supposedly going to be merch given away at the Winter Wonderland thing
Wasnâ€™t that last week?
It was snowing earlier today but it just stopped
i'm a little worried about my flight back on sunday if it's gonna snow
don't wanna get diverted to toledo or columbus 💀
"haaank don't abbreviate cyberpunk haaaank"
i don't use the steam version fortunately
i prob wont buy any games cuz even if i buy them i wont have time or energy to play them
and broke
uh oh
The Duo authentication recovered for my other accounts I used it for, but now it's stuck in a loop for Case
get your old phone and verify it thru that then??
So I do the call thing and it works on the redirect, but it doesn't actually work on the app
It got wiped already ;-;
Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s the same textbook used for math 121
who enjoys CBT btw (closed beta testing)
bro who in the fuck in my dorm is eating popcorn for all of their meals this fucking break
sorry for your loss
you need to branch out 😭
Time to go to sleep in an hour!
The only reason I'm still up to text you all
I can't believe I forgot about Chicago time, my bad
No need to be sorry
Unfortunately I canâ€™t sleep rn
Just canâ€™t
That feeling when brain says no?
I'm sorry to hear that
I feel like I should say this is how sickness happened when you fell asleep at your desk...
Leo got sick, likely after falling asleep at his desk doing hw late at night, or at least it definetly didn't help
Iâ€™m not tired lmao
Just doing mentally bad
Maybe work + bed combo would help you sleep?
As in that wouldnâ€™t work?
I canâ€™t rly work in bed
Iâ€™ve tried before, it doesnâ€™t work
Back and neck starts cramping to hell. Also the fact I canâ€™t focus in bed on work
So basically you wouldnâ€™t get tired nor would you be productive
â€œThe weather outside is rizzy, but the fire is so skibbidi, but since  Iâ€™ve gyatt to go, Ohio Ohio Ohioâ€
I have bright pink hair u cant miss me
it had been snowing on and off yesterday. havenâ€™t looked outside today but it probably will today also
Like didn't go home for break?
Too cold outside
no i didnt go home for break
I am at the airport picking folks up for free
Hawk 1: Yo, you wont believe it, I met einstein today!
Hawk 2: The bagel guy?
Hawk 1: No!!! The stone bruh
Hawk 2: Uh
I have to get up at 4:30 am for my flight back holy fuck
Iâ€™m getting up at 3:00 am for the drive back 😭
Yeah but you can just get in the car and continue sleeping
jfk isnâ€™t
last time i went to jfk, they were under construction, and caused a huge delay that made my family miss a connecting flight
jfk iirc used to be better than laguardia, but the latter has been through so much construction its basically a new airport
The terminal is nice don't get me wrong
But the controllers have no idea what the fuck they're doing
They have too much traffic for the space they have
You can disagree but that's the long and the short of it
They need to improve everything that isn't the terminal itself
i wasn't on spirit airlines either, it was delta airlines
cuz they didn't have open gates for us
My inbound flight on Tuesday got delayed by an hour because of traffic congestion at lga lmao
oh!
It's fucking huge
Wait my bad that's denver airport
I really should sleep before I collapse on the subway tomorrow
literally the other domestic only airport in dallas is comparable to lagaurdia
like damn lagaurdia, you are being outdone by a puny ass domestic airport
narita airport jumpscare lmao
jesus i can't spell
never been there so i don't have any opinions
Is surprisingly good considering they only have 2 runways for insane amounts of traffic
nashville international airport looks a little awful tho
and LAX looks clean af
Truth or Consequences Municipal Airport
Planners basically said "fuck crosswinds" and put in 5 runways lmaooo
bro that airport reduces the lifespan of any ATC worker by at least 15% just by being near it
i can't believe that's a real airport that looks like hell
solid 6/10 of pain
doesn't look like the worst but still is bad
a little awful but still not comparing to truth or consequences lmao
what in the fuck
like what in the fuck is that sort of mmethod
"united 211 taxi via alpha alpha golf india 7 zulu 4 hold short 33C at victor 829" or some shit
fuck LAX
tho tbf i've only used LAX twice
LAX caused me nothing but pain and suffering every time i flew there
once when i was 5 and second when i went there earlier this year
absolutely awful to navigate
especially for people who arent ablebodied
like it looks more or less like any other decent airport
once when dropping off my brother to LAX it took 40+ min to get in and out of traffic
fuck that airport bro
nah its not supposed to snow
dont
damn
NOT YET
cuz he's gonna hear christmas music during his work
I'm gonna be absolutely exhausted by the time I get back!
I need a 45 for a B so Iâ€™m fine Iâ€™m gonna do a solid lock in so that I donâ€™t choke on the exam
I just have to really lock in for this and go through notes and exams
about damn time
How hard is it snowing rn
Not super bad
Are the roads bad
I don't think so?
It doesn't look like thrre's much snow rn, but it is snowing a bit and is very cold
why are the ALEKS so annoying now
i don't want to do the titration ;-;
PSA to all chem 111 folks: ALL of the ALEKS are due Friday
i hate titrations and galvanic cells
Idk
I have 38 I think but I havenâ€™t checked in a while
oh dear.
and itâ€™ll probably go up once I fail some in the final knowledge check
the final pie thing though
yea but everything we do for the rest goes into the final pie
OMG HOORAY!!!
Leo has gone insane
He has lost his arch nemesis and is now without purpose
Only 11 and youâ€™re already going mad
idk
Fuck you mean you don't know
"hey drew meyer so my internet was down and I don't think the aleks stuff I did went through but I did get a screenshot of it..."
Praying that drew Meyer does ask any questions like "how did you do it if you didn't have Internet"
Now you have no other option except accepting my language as  equal linguistic partners as English. Whoâ€™s the alpha now huh?
I'm scared
The class itself is apparently slightly less difficult tho
only slightly though
oh okie
I have now figured out why I suffer so much chest pain and itâ€™s just fucking emotional pain goddamn lmao
Nope
how do i study for chem 113 final
Why does chem 113 seem so inexplicably difficult
it's so stupid
Itâ€™s like the easiest lab idk why we have a test
apparently it's super easy, as long as you have an A rn you can afford a 60%
idk i have mine on thursday
I think youâ€™re not allowed to do that except for the IR spectra thing
he said we couldnt past our dlrs or dors
can i see someone's experiment 5 calculations? i think i messed mine up and i just want to make sure i used the right stuff
youi will lose it
Which is why you donâ€™t procrastinate
30 left
I think I'm starting to get equilibrium
where was this before exam 3
you ass hard boiled
my chest is still hurting a little every now and then
wrong
wtf-
Itâ€™s still concerning
health counselling did jack shit for me when i went
bro they'll give me meds for when im sick but when i called them telling them my chest was hurting they were like "just keep monitoring it"
Nothing
it's not consistent either
So I actually havenâ€™t been paying attention in class
Bro it would just randomly reset my fucking math modules even tho i got them all rigjt in the module check
that one was hard
i dont do meth
I donâ€™t know when I need to use the ICE chart
nah even i had this issue but it wasnt that bad
Oh we need to check that??
whenever you get the molality you find out what's limiting or not
that ones also annoying
I know and I hate it
Not bad
I heard the string one takes longer
Tbh my TA was chill with us not doing every trial because we couldn't even get like 8 nodes for some reason
But you still need 116 which is the same labs as 122 just all algebraic
Oh 💀
Iâ€™ve had chest pain like 8 times in the last 16 hours
I wake up and the south korean president tried to declare martial law
but it seems even his own party thinks itâ€™s a terrible idea so weâ€™ll see how it plays out
Jjust what we need, more wars
If we die we die
MAD
(Im so scared)
The email (and frankly the bill) is poorly worded (I mean is that surprising for such a stupid bill) 

But I am pretty sure that single occupancy gender neutral restrooms are still fine, just multi occupancy ones are not, but it doesn't define what is multi-vs single occupancy so Case could probably argue that those bathrooms are technically single occupancy and are therefore exempt.

The bill also does not contain any sort of enforcement mechanism or penalties for breaking the law 
(Because it's a stupid bill written by stupid people who just want to create fear) 

In general the whole thing is performative fear mongering so stupid bigoted politicians can say they did something about the problem they made up 

But the bill is completely ridiculous and unenforceable even if a school wanted to enforce it and Case does not want to enforce it.
Still it's extremely that sad we live in a state where the politicians are spending their time stoking fear of normal people instead of actually legislating to fix any real issues that actually effect people
the only time ive ever judged someone for being in a bathroom is when i watch them walk about without washing their hands
So real, they need to not
The bill doesnâ€™t affect single stall bathrooms I think. And also what if I bash governor deDickheads skull in with a bat
im mad he gave in considering he vetoed a bill banning gender affirming care for minors but the republicans got mad and overturned his veto
yeah I was just talking yesterday about how they really only care about trans women and gay men because itâ€™s easy to fearmonger about big scary â€œmenâ€
They have never experienced a trans lady promising death and destruction on you and your family the most pretty dress
same people who turn a blind eye to abusive priests 🫠
did anyone already have their chem 113 final today
I donâ€™t like Texas v much
Now this is the kind of stuff that really needs enforcing
Apparently https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precordial_catch_syndrome
Good to know it shouldnâ€™t be too serious then
Dont
I will now try and make it so much worse
Step 1: tons of caffeine, 0 sleep for 48 hours
Please don't
I wonâ€™t
My friend said that the experiments do take a while and some people didnâ€™t finish it
Jk I wonâ€™t I legit donâ€™t think my body can handle anything like that
Uh oh
they need to give a seminar about this at every high school and uni
would save so many ER visits
common enough apparently that ben knows immediately
donâ€™t
if someone doesn't know that they have it and it suddenly appears i feel like its still worth a doctors appt (source: my dad had a heart attack)
Thereâ€™s a heart on the back too
I canâ€™t tell if this is meant for someone or if itâ€™s just there for anyone
The temptation is understandable though
Iâ€™m so curious now tho
As to who left it and for what purpose
i don't agree
colorado doesn't have egg bagels though and it makes me so sad
how many fucking states are there 😭
unfortunately i have work to do
lame
its still bland 😭
damn 😔
I DIDNT DO ANYTHING

idk
Sorry to say but L opinion
~~but he's correct though~~
holy shit yes
one of the most annoying people I know tbh
had the biggest ego in the school, which is saying a lot for someone from Tenafly
Really anything goes
im from the place where on youtube there was that meme going around where the temperature was 10000 degrees and everyone was dead
He also applied REA to some school and also applied EA to like USC and def broke the agreement
oh!
oh damn I didn't even hear about that
I just know a lot of people in my school were pissed off cause after he accepted his offer from Harvard he didn't rescind his applications for other competitive schools
Dude I hate group projects
DUDE I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP
im so sorry holy shit
If you want to be bored out of your mind go visit McKinney
I ainâ€™t going to the sun 💀
Embed fail
Clarisse go the fuck to sleep why am I going to bed earlier than most people now
I can't figure out my math hw
I won't sleep at like 2 tho I promise
Dw I won't
I think I'm starting to get sick so
How the fuck do you even change the name
so u can search it and find out
Highly stupid and a dead brain thing to do lowkey
yeah bro fucked up he shouldnt even be saying that
Maybe donâ€™t??
not as bad as that 💀
holy shit
Phys 121 exams are released on Thursday :(
Luckily I guessed dog
I guessed dog because I thought butler was a dog person

I hate aleks
I finally passed the stupid solubility one
shoutout for leo for informing me it's due this friday
but start now and don't stop until friday
If you need help lmk
Oh dear
Not yet
I ate instead of locking tf in

anyways i need to lock in
chem exam 2 summary session packet
20 more left
I think itâ€™s stuff that needs review
no i didnt fail everything
but this is doable before friday cuz ik it
What I feel like im going through rn
you guys ever feel the need to jump over the moon to walk to work on a sunday christmas evening when your dog is telling you his life story during high school when the chair had a remote control car that attacked the astronaut? and because of that barack obama started installing galvanized square steel into your apartment as a way to give back to his community during the 1900s? gosh what times when time travel became a thing
it only became a thing after my shoebox started talking to me like my sleep paralysis demon telling me about how he lost his long lost love
when itâ€™s shivering cold
and i canâ€™t sleep
Is your heater working?
i might be sick
Oh no!
i maybe shouldnâ€™t have walked 5 miles in this weather
Consider checking if you have a fever rn
Yeah no donâ€™t do that actually
As hot as is it is, you need the higher temps to fight infections better
Donâ€™t bake but donâ€™t just subject yourself to trying to cool off too much
because it keeps sliding off
i cracked it tho cuz i hit another persons staff way too hard
chat i don't think im gonna be able to sleep tonight
spent 40 minutes laughing my ass off at poor translation attempts by an AI from japanese to english in real time
oh no
stupid reef is now sleep reef
You're not stupid
nope
saw footage tho
and was sorta near 💀
Omg this
am i wrong tho?
there's another poll
Donâ€™t sacrifice your health for the bit
it sounds like someone doesn't want more polls
You need to sleep
what if i dont
Health go bad
but mine is already bad
The health get worse
but what if i make it worse
The funnies can be done in a way that doesnâ€™t damage your health
Is it really THAT bad?
Study
damn
I need to transcribe all my equations 😭
omg im literally doing that rn
Oh jeez
It really is bad out there
Iâ€™m getting no more than 3 hours tonight
Have you gone to sleep yet?
Thereâ€™s genuinely like a blizzard outside
for like 2 and a half hours
i wasnt trying to sleep
holy shit its snowing
i saw the snow at 2 but i thought that would be the end of it
Itâ€™s so bad
its so cold in my room bro im wearing a sweater 😭
Oh wtf I just looked outside
Gotta clean the driveway 🤩
Omg I am so sorry
Have they started even cleaning around Case, out of curiosity?
And the roads throughout Cleveland suck
Hoping and praying too 😭
Wait I still have a psych test today crap :D
wtf
Idk
Wtf
But apparently it gets worse from 10-3
I wonder theoretically if school were to be cancelled what would happen with that tho
fuck
Itâ€™s the last day of classes for many courses
Ooo joy it feels like -2 degrees F outside
I feel like thereâ€™s no way I can go to my 8:30 right
wtf
The weather outside truly is frightful
The feels like
Donâ€™t jinx it
Aw man, I hope it gets better
ive hit the point where im tired and i want the semester to be over 😭
Just gotta get though finals
I couldn't focus earlier this morning but also I'm basically cramming for my psych test (again)
i havent been home since the semester started 😭
And I was proposed the idea that I study, sleep for 3 hours, study, and then sleep until I need to wake up
I just can't remember if I have a haircut later today before psych so I was like I'll just get in the sleep I can
Atp I'm just gonna pray tho
Sleep in till when?
Idk
Atp I'm cooked either way so
Is it my fault I didnâ€™t start preparing earlier? Yes
If my math quiz gets cancelled today Iâ€™ll jump in hot
Why has my 8:30 professor not emailed yetâ€¦
Ots so bad iutside please
Hopefully they'll have mercy since they have to weather the weatehr
same but i dont trust myself
I feel bad for commuters
I wish you luck with what you do have today
Omg is that the final thing
yes i hate it
I hate it
its so close to finals man
i have like so much shit to do i started studying like yesterday
i wish the final was a project like in bio lab
Are you worried about Chem lab?
Ngl I promise itâ€™s not as bad as you think
Itâ€™s really not too bad donâ€™t worry
Does not seem likely
Ok I actually need to get some sleep in now
i dont think classes r cancelled i saw a car drive by
wake up early
Go outside itâ€™s literally blizzard core
The sky hasnâ€™t changed color
Someone email kaler
Idk
don't wanna walk down there and then immediately back up
like i am legit risking frostbite going to class in this weather
Itâ€™s horrible out there
i dont think they gaf 😭
They cleared up the sidewalk 15 mins ago and now itâ€™s fully covered in snow again
Supposedly the snow is supposed to stop in 44 minutes
i have nothing to cover my face with other than a scarf tho so my nose might get a little fucked up
Oh no ;-;
idk
someone lost their size medium gloves when crossing to binary
(Please donâ€™t make me go to accounting today, I donâ€™t wanna leave the dorm)
Then simply don't go
Oh do you have finals rn?
My MechE/music friend was saying how thereâ€™s like 2 10 minutes sessions for finals post break
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ do what u want man
@mism0937 if it makes u any more confident the test wasnâ€™t bad
But not bad
Gonna cry a little
(Itâ€™s not that bad just it sounds different and I donâ€™t like it)
Do I need to print out the ir stuff?
I forgot to
oh no
Itâ€™s not bad like I said, it just changes how much volume my instrument can make
Idk what ur talking about 😭
I guedd that's not horrible but still not ideal
They didnâ€™t give us one
Well that could have gone better
How much do u need to  get an A
But idk
I didnâ€™t finish an experiment though
Shit really
Oh
The thing is I didnâ€™t get around to writing my reactions
Youâ€™d probably lose like a max of 10
I think part 1 went as well as it could have though
damn it seems most ppl did that
i didnt wanna do 6 😓
I donâ€™t think I saw anyone choose the one with magnesium
it seemed longer than titrations
The chemical reactions didnâ€™t even work out for me the day we had lab for it
I didnâ€™t trust myself so I did titrations
I rushed it idk if itâ€™s really accurate
i want to undiscover this
that is so sad
when i took it i felt Awful about it and needed about this grade for an A and ended up with a 76% ish. i promise itâ€™s probably fine
i wasted like 40 minutes bc i didnâ€™t realize the meltemp i was using was broken
Something similar happened with me but not nearly as bad 💀
I initially used the wrong setting for the MelTemp, the one that takes forever to heat
I wasted decent amount of time trying to figure out what was wrong before the TA came around
Nothing close to 40 minutes though
my fucking aleks
I don't remember what it's called or about
Apparently cwru owes me 10k 💀
Theyâ€™ll deposit it if they want to
tfw when you realize you could just not even show up for the phys 122 final exam and still technically pass the class (i will not do that for very obvious reasons)
They wont do that probably, i dont have a permanent address lmao
That happened to me once when they owed me 1k
Idk your particular situation but it could happen
It shoild be put in my account tho, since i have direct deposit
Idk how exactly they will resolve
But I mean, I have direct deposit set for work and they still gave me a check in the mail
naurrrr i forgot my calculator in the lab 😭 not yusuf having to put out an announcement about it
i think i still have it
Growlithe drawing but worse
when the founding fathers said life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, this is what they meant by liberty
had a room with a window on that side on 8th floor last sem
I hate 8th floor so much that I think smtg in my body would discombobulate if I figure out what person on that floor is making all the noise
aw poo i missed the sunset
I missed it cuz I was performing and yapping backstage lmao
(the dead snowman in the corner)
The opposite of correct is left, right?
idk
A character who is 100% dead on the inside
yeah one could say im missing out heavy
rain
and rain
Oh no ;-;
im not trying to get frozen like a popsicle on the way to work
Rain + cold = misery 😞
I DONT WANNA BE AT WORK
WILL NEED IT
the DoD can't spell ofc
Just asking so it doesn't look like im intruding
do we get wepa money back? im assuming it was put in our fees
Anyone know where to find the schedule for Math Gala
Oh I'm not
I'm gonna murder this fucking software
my computer screen is gonna kiss a hammer if this keeps happening
uh oh
I barely studied for math 121
That feeling when youâ€™ve reached day 1 of finals
Who is putting finals at 8
I need a nap
You just need more sleep lol
5 hours before the math 121 exam
I mean until the math 121 exam
I mean both work
So yours isnâ€™t?
Which is def for the better because Butler hasn't finished grading our third exams 💀
Oh dear 😬
Which is quite interesting considering I see half the class blatantly cheating during exams with no repercussions as far as I know
Oh man
What Butler does is she makes us do these weekly InQuizitive quizzes which suck
And then we have three on-paper exams
And you earn or lose points based on if you get the question right or wrong
So if you get a question wrong when you had a confidence of 100 points you lose 50 points
i mean i dont have anything to do thursday all day so
but what if i slept late, and slept in the whole day
I need to study like all of chem today
And youâ€™re saying his isnâ€™t already?
How bad is it?
With the exception of last night, consistently usually less than 6 hours
Except with less caffenine
why do I have to do both an essay and study at the same time
Didnâ€™t get less than half points so Iâ€™m chillin
didnt do as well as i hoped but it oke
Still an A?
To anyone taking a calc exam, this should hopefully help â¤ï¸
this either makes no sense or I'm extremely confused
math 121 starts at 3:30 right?
Also tfw you realize you accidentally forgot to hit the submit button on your hw so it never got submitted
SUCH A STUPID THING I DID TO MISS POINTS ON
Damn
like those are the grades i need on the final exam
i could just not even show up and still get a C in the class lmao
i should be fine, i can scuff the exam p hard imo
the exam grades tho
they are CLEAN
im gonna miss fernando 🤧
"have you guys seen that tiktok where i said i wanted to kill myself?" - Fernando
it's cuz he's a physics major
we gotta check in on fernando in like a decade and we're gonna find he's lost like 50% of his hair
eh i dont know if anyone recorded it
damn
I'm studying so hard for chem rn
LOCK THE FUCK IN
hard task
and pray that the person who triggered it isn't getting their asses hunted
Truly a horrible punishment
i don't think he's a bot but
they must be really ramping it up for finals week
did he really type the pKb into the calculator wrong TWICE before getting the right answer
well, I might be cooked, but at least it'll be pretty hard to bomb this hard enough to fail the class
well, here I am in the chem 111 room for the last time
But i can do it now i dont have a final till monday
i wanna mod 😗 i want power
The cs math major to discord mod pipeline 💀💀💀
You guys might be my friends but idk which of you i should mod if any 💀
u saying u want to be mod?
I never said a thing
he said ping him if you want mod
(he didn't)
I feel bad for him lowkey
Anyone want to like do me a favor and make a server icon for the 29 server
Bad mods iirc
Bonus points if it spells cwru wrong (I recommend crwu)
Scroll all the way down until you see the weird icon among the server icons to the far left
This is what has stopped me from going on the CWRU hub personally just out of privacy concerns
Fair
I don't see it
The class of 26 server and moderation sucks. 
I complained about them never banning bots frequently enough that they made me mod, but if I remember correctly on that server mods don't even have the permissions to ban people, only the owners do, 

And then some stuff happened with people just acting really weird on that server and the whole thing just got so bad and uncomfortable I just left the server.
That sounds horrible
Oh I don't have that
Are you on your laptop
Ohh I see it on my phone now
Is it still active at all?
kill
the artistic vision was to make it feel like it was made by hand, and embody all mistakes made (hence why no eraser was used)
I can already feel the excitement the class of 2029 people are going to feel as soon as they look at that logo and go "wow, this is my new community"
either they're gonna be scared or join the chaos nearly instantly
Background needs to be brighter though
Idk, I left. 
The last thing that was active was just people harassing some poor  guy.

And I tried to DM him and was like want me to do anything about those people? And initially he was like no, 
And then it kept happening, so I made him a mod so he could maybe deal with it directly if he changed his mind and left the server and then a bit later he DMed me that he left the server because they went too far and he had gotten tired of it
One of the mods kicked me as a â€œjoke between friendsâ€ and he wasnâ€™t my friend
Also they made a secret second general channel that the mods couldnâ€™t see to train a few of us for the mod revolution???
The reason I made so many mods here is that I was expecting serious shit to go down like in the past so servers, but about all weâ€™ve gotten is like 2 people and a bunch of spam
Don't be the third
Yeah sorry I havenâ€™t been super active
A couple of freshmen were trying to become uncomfortably close to me, so I decided to become less active to avoid more of that happening
man itâ€™s snowing so hard
So I backed away for a while
Sorry to hear that happened
Oh well, nothing came of it
FUCK THE DRIVEWAY
anyways clarisse go fucking study psych
Oh yeah, wish you the best with that Clarisse!
i will be chilling on vc tonight if anyone wants to just hang around while they study (or procrasinate or whatever people do when they don't have any super pressing finals)
Study!!! (I am not studying)
Everyone who has a final tomorrow needs to be studying rn
I told myself lots of studying would happen today
Guess what did not happen
i'm a god at phys 122 you can't make me stu- *gets shot*
Alex youâ€™d be disappointed in me, I have an 89.93% in manifolds right now
Rip, can't be that dissapointed, I don't think I'm getting the A in diff eq
if i get a 90% or above on my calc 2 exam i will consider becoming a math dual major
how does it make the math majors here feel knowing i'm ending calc 3 most likely with a C
I leave that mantle to you now
hes gonna die 😭
he will be dead 😭
(this will never happen 😔 )
couldn't possibly see that going wrong lmao
oh yesss
more or less a similar vibe to this should work
tho i think the homework channel should be maybe held off on until the mods are more suited to do stuff?
Yeah and also they dont need a homework channel until they start classes
oh god i never wanna see APs again
My arm feels v itchy
have u tried hydrocortisone
like this doesn't happen in the mornings or afternoon
oh its bumpy
because if its like. a bite or something that sorta line is really bad
FUCK YEAH IM GONNA DIE (no thats not good im very aware)
like it feels like a line of very small little bumps that happen when ever you get little bitchy bugs that bite and then leave a mark
i dont think so
i am just used to being sick and having weird symptoms
unfortunately the btd6 stream will be gone for now
they dont need to know how
Aleks would make a humanities major cry
It makes everyone cry
We get to work towards brining the boom
Iâ€™m air cooling it outside
god i think my body is rly just saying "fuck you" right near the end of this semester lol
what happened to you
Did you ever end up going to the hospital???
The rashiness is moving all over my body ;-;
Starting to feel more and more like an allergy
are you alone in a double room?
But my old roommate still has to move his stuff out
Oh is he leaving case?
No hes just leaving dorms
go flood it and cause Alex massive pain
damn lmao
but then again spring admits prob want to room with other spring admits also incoming
idek how this is gonna work
honestlyyyy im chill w anyone as long as they dont get on my nerves
i'm really sorry lindsey - i was hoping they would just give you the room to yourself
KEK they might still?
maybe they realized they cant admit so many students
oh my god I can't believe they made a new one already
I'm really close to the server limit
impossible to be active in all of them but like. how else am i supposed to see the rotaeno patch notes
IF ANYONE LOST ANYTHING IN TINK OR WANTS TO GO LOST AND FOUND SHOPPING THEY'RE HOLDING THINGS ON A TABLE BY THE MAIN TABLE
2029 isn't a real year guys
this would kill a medieval child
Wtf is Drew Meyer on
im not asking anymore give me your grades 🔫
cuz wtf is drew meyer on
Writing those finals really took a hit on Meyer I suppose
why cant he do that for 111 :(
Theres still no Titanfall 3
i've never bothered reviewing exams after turning it in xd 😗
Are exams scores out?
Does anyone know what happens if i don't submit a project for csds 132?
oh it would
@reddishlightning how do i apply for head mod
Sorry
I have not taken it
the projects arent for a grade
since thereâ€™s 3 other 25% sections
I've been talking to a lot of people who took 132, and 
- they did not have a 5th project
- all of their work was graded traditionally
so I don't think anyone knows.
Charlie is probably less so but geneds and such still overlap
how many ru taking a semester
More than I need to
do you guys act n shit?
... or they act and shit, major difference
geminid was visible last night!
u tripping i think it's gotten worse
