get rid of all of it it's all bad
no sorry
sorry it's not yag it's dyno jesus we have too many bots
here :) 
can u please give power to this one 
sorry
oh is that what happened?
i need to sleep tbh
@.bugcatcapoo sorry for putting so much stress on you
it was also just not really set up well for ppl who arent familiar with discord and we had some discussions of things that should probably not have been discussed
I feel like a ü§° for registering for a 3 week calculus class
i know that cwru is flexible w majors so im hoping this shouldnt be too hard
after u get accepted, it won't really matter what u applied for
u declare a major at the end of your sophomore year
yeah
i mean
as long is u don't go overtime with your time in college
I mean you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exactly need to do that if you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t declared a major yet/ started classes
so the major i put down on my application doesnt matter?
Nope
nope
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand the stuff on case√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s website
instead of them disappearing into history
I think they are currently working on changing the setup and this is the makeshift one
What the fuck hahahaha
Its can go either way
Lol I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going through Khan academy Chem because I probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t survive bio without it
As someone who loaded up on AP courses in high school, I felt like I was prepared for the course load this past semester. Still, there were times where I felt overworked and stressed out, but that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s college. Also two of the classes (Calc 2 and Gen chem 1) contained content I had seen before in hs, which helped. Bio, some of the content was from AP, but there was not so much overlap compared to Calc 2 and Gen chem 1 imo
I honestly wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t survive at all without khan academy üòÇ
Sal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voice is embedded into my head
I would say the classes won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be awful as long as you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re keeping up, seeking help when needed, and utilizing your resources
Well not actually √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbad√¢‚Ç¨ as in failing but I was not getting the grade I wanted so I had to cram hard for that final
Same here. It took me half a semester to get back into the groove of school
Gen chem 1 is about half of AP chem content? So if you want to review content earlier, I recommend reviewing AP chem material. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be a great place to start
adding to that
study before and for each lecture
and **write notes**
Up to you really
What do you mean... if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re only taking bio then you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to know chem........üòÇ
In bio, you hardly touch on the chemistry of the processes√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù literally they may be minute details but nothing extensive at all
If you have to learn about the energetics of a process, it will be about what happens and what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s involved (like ATP and GTP), but  you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to know chemical equations and such lol
@moseslee does that answer your question? Sorry if I misinterpreted what you asked
but then again don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t most people take chem with bio
OH are you saying most don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t double major in chem and bio?
Because general chemistry for freshmen is spread out over two semester-long courses and isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t related to biology at all.
But as a bio major you still have to take freshman-level chemistry
And don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t double major for both...?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m strictly classical though (have been for over 10 years) but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m looking into jazz
~~not that 10-year part though~~
Sorry I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see this at all! Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how I missed it. To be honest, no we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learn much. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not the same without the hands-on experience
I figured :/ hopefully this pandemic doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t last for long
do u count y tho?
@sprinkles2108 I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m avoiding putting the link in the server for that reason but I have an open invitation for members who want to get in to send me proof that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not randos
gonna be deleting the server in half an hour but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotten a lot of people in by that already
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one already :v
23 server is open but we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get random people tbh
I replied to the wrong thing rip
But what I mean is whether it's okay with the moderators here if I advertise this server in places that CWRU students read like r/cwru. I understand that they don't want trolls, but there's a line between not wanting trolls/non-CWRU people and making it too difficult for CWRU students to find this
Well what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m currently doing is having people directly messaging me and answering at set of questions and that seems to be working so far, I would say advertise it but don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give out the link freely
Nope
RIP old server
i was asking more specifically on how many of those students get into cwru√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s own medical college
That I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure if there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really an advantage of going to cwru for undergrad if you want to go there for med school
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping that perhaps forming relationships with some of the teachers, getting good LORs or doing research w medical school professors could give me an edge
From when I talked to the pre-med advisor here he said they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really keep stats on that but obviously making connections with anyone is good for med school
shadow isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in this game it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a travesty
Sonic games were so much better when I was younger. Replaying them I realize how glitchy they were. Damn there unbearable
Still love sonic riders tho
you run faster than the camera can move and like half of the walls can just be directly run through, causing you to fall straight into the void and instantly die
also all of the buttons are mapped to like 20 different things and the hit boxes are really finicky so most of the time you try to talk to someone you end up launching yourself 50 feet straight to the right
I still have sonic adventure 2 and I cry on every mission for knuckles
hot weather area
oh my god all us California kids are going to step outside once and instantly die
I already find it cold here during the winter season.... Imagine us in Cleveland... The snow looks so pretty tho üòÉ
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen snow in
except in the distance on mountains
@mortonsalt1195 i love grey's too!! i literally started it a few weeks ago (im so late) and on season 4
@livlavluv OMG ITS SO GOOD I WANT TO HEAR ALL OF YOUR OPINIONS GO
I miss Mcdreamy and Mcsteamy

that would be the zoo, its a bit further away but good for a day trip
*when rona isnt here*
Btw I forgot who is learning asl but every year at zoo there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s deaf and hard of hearing day (just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be the stereotypical hearing asl student....)

But idk it may be possible?
i basically want to do avionics
yeah, I just don't like ME as much even though i'm better at it
especially when i thought i broke a 1.5 million dollar robot
I don't know how many applied, but 30/215 (14%) of the people that matriculated to CWRU med school in 2020 got their bachelor's degree here https://case.edu/medicine/admissions-programs/md-programs/class-profiles
guess we gotta go fetch him
Haha no I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very bad at support
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have foreign parents but a really good friend of mine√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s parents do that with her and me
no i always do you're not alone
i also have done it a few times at school and then i feel super awk ü§°
OH SNAP
I grew up bilingual but my parents only speak English, so I had the reverse issue which was when I was a little kid and hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learned that English and Spanish were separate languages I would speak to my parents with a combination and get confused when they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand what I was trying to say
my brother had it worse, since he picked up extra spanish from me and from his preschool, it took him even longer to learn how to separate English and Spanish
My sister is less fluent in Hindi than I am because my mom wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t always around when she was younger
zhanda never lies
this mix sounds like shit
In college
I HATE SNOW
Nothing is real
I miss vine

the games are nOT SUPPORTED ANYMORE. THEY CAN STILL BE PURCHASED, RUN ON A PC, AND OPENED BUT BECAUSE THE WEBSITE NO LONGER SUPPORTS LOGIN FOR THESE GAMES THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY BE STARTED
this is a fucking outrage
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so mad
fuck
trying to find a workaround because the data clearly still exists on the disc
if i had a pc on me i would be willing to hexedit the shit out of it
might be able to reverse engineer
@sprinkles2108 I am fineeee I just hate the cold üò≠
>  I just hate the cold

you can't just walk around campus naked
and the dorms dont have ac

When were there for most of the time it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold
So they just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have ac
Where is the school spirit peepeepoopoo?
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they compete a ton
*no, it doesnt make sense to me either*
KPop is good don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate brother

I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listened to much Kpop therefore I will not judge
it's all of the bad parts of normal pop
Really?
i don't like it
it's just boring
Kpop stans tho
No need for the /s
If you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been addicted to a hard drug are you really a musician?
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we all
Don't hate kpop
kpop bad
but u shouldn't hate a music genre
i'm fine with bluegrass because it's like sophisticated country but country bad
ur bad

i don't really like kpop but i'm not gonna get it banned or some shit
johnny cash is not bad
older country in general isn't bad but new stuff is
if anyone wants to steal my internet accounts you're halfway there
forgot discord doesn't like lenny
I spent a whole day trying to make my pass phrase
dude case password system is broken
Shit i have to change my pass phrase

lol why does it look like they haven't updated it since 2005
> if i had a pc on me i would be willing to hexedit the shit out of it
@_zacc  didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see this but after digging around on the internet I found a .exe that everyone else who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s run into this problem has been using. someone managed to find a way to false positive the login system and get into the game. hopefully it will work :cri:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna cry that took SO LONG

im dead
oh my goodness
i hate auto emojis
on laptop ofc
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still awful
me too, i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think the people were critically injured thankfully
that's scary
My biggest fear is like getting injured or something bad happening when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a holiday or traveling
oh my gosh...
oh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so awful
> have wanted to get out of the suburbs for so long
um well
fair
shit smell like cigarettes all the time
and case is surrounded by rich ppl suburbs and poor ppl suburbs
theres literally no one outside ever
but you should still come
ok no cap i hate the reply feature on discord
although i go to a super preppy school in NC we are in a sketchy neighborhood and have had to lock down because people have robbed nearby places and run through campus
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe this I anticipated that cleveland was gonna be a super classy city full of people living the high life and going to operas you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re telling me that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold and there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s crime
crime isn't real
you aint finding classy inside of america
@_zacc shit true
you ain't finding classy period
yea well other ppl dont do that?? i still get pinged??
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why people are really wondering whether it was a terrorist attack. If they really wanted to hurt people, that warning wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have gone off. And why at 6:30 AM on Christmas morning?? No one was around at all pretty much other than apartment dwellers
you will be walking to dunkin donuts in the freezing cold on a monday morning
its annoying
kai, i wonder if it was for property dmg, like not to hurt ppl, but to hurt structures
shaker heights is a wealthy area tho
on mobile the pings are the only way to tell if someone is responding to you because it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show the message being replied to
unless there is an update I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten
seems abt right
oh idk
oh I was on the wrong tab
oh
my hometown is 77% white hehe rip
apparently my city is supposed to become a "silicon prairie" so we're about to pop off in a few decades
rip
sorry
my dad is on town council actively trying to convince all the boomers to stop being racist and let them build low income housing
without telling them that the reason they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it is that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re racist
is he still married
I say my dad is on town council what that means is he was elected in a non-presidential running year by like 100 millennials trying to get rid of a 90 year old woman who thought cell towers were giving children HPV or something
yes my parents are happily married I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry to say
my dad was also one of the only san mateo county officials to read the entire police policy manual and he wrote a 14 page dossier on everything that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong with it
yeah town council meetings are kinda funny to sit in on becayse my dad will be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthis country systematically discriminates against minorities√¢‚Ç¨ and then some crazy old person will stand up and be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmy neighbor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s begonias are poisoning my grandson and making him worse at reading√¢‚Ç¨
saying that he cheated on his wife and shit
but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t prove that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s him so I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t force him to stop
also he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already been suspended for sexually harassing students and my school has a thing against expelling seniors so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d need concrete evidence to go to the school saying that he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s harassing the spouse of one of their math teachers by yelling false information about him in a public forum
I fucking despise this kid he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s honestly possibly the worst person I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever met
ik a republican who believes white supremacy isn't real √¢≈ì¬®
but he himself isn't racist
but he's lost
And that racism doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really exist anymore....
oh????
"racism doesnt exist it's literally illegal to discriminate based on race" fucking cocaine is illegal but guess what
ppl still use it
yeah minorities have been subjugated for all of human history but like that was in the Past that's all Gone Now we Got Rid Of It
my school just hired someone to do that a few years ago
AND THEN WENT,
IDK AARON
I would argue that if they're equally qualified you should hire the black woman because she's more likely to have had to face resistance in the process of getting to her position
i didnt doxx him there are literally millions of ppl in this country named aaron
fair
oh no now youre gonna find him because i gave u his extremely common first name i cant believe it no please dont harass this literal incel
too late i found him üëÄ
i cant believe u would just
sorry
https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/taylor-hawkins-son-drummer/ cant believe they spelled zacc's name wrong in this article
and i don't play drums either
ok for real though that kid kinda looks like an 11 year old me
wtf
you forgot about zachary
average height slim, average height heavy, extremely short, extremely tall
and then u have buzzcut or bowl cut and dark hair and light hair
you forgot the skater kid preset
you need kids with even longer hair than bowl cut
skater doesnt hit until age 12
fat af
> fat af
> average height heavy
11 year old fat kids arent just fat they're fucking ROBUST
i was fat af
*still am, but was as well*
fat 11 year olds are like
if you kill their parents u r legally allowed to adopt them
actually that last one is unironically pretty suitable to me as an 11 year old so maybe that one shouldnt count
when are we getting school roles back
lol I joined the server it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lonely üòû
Oh what there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a CWRU one?
Oh
Apparently there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a CWRU one but idk the IP

Who would want to be Quaker Oats
my high school was the koalas üò≠ worst mascot tbh
i feel like at least half of all high school mascots are panthers
koalas arent scary tho
idc tho the koalas is so lame
But we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go down in history so F
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
My school is panthers and this enemy school is cougars
my school is panthers and the enemy school is... drumroll please.... also the panthers
I think a school near my county is a well
our other rival is the GATORS which makes NO FUCKING SENSE
They need to be more reactive these days
Is there a school with a mascot of Sphinx
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dead üíÄ
At least y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick an indigenous person to be your mascot
ME IN PRE SCHOOL WTH
only valid version is what my history teacher had us do last year which was he would assign each of us a character at like a "congress meeting"
damn evan go off
i feel like usually that sort of thing happens bc it's like
like when my mom was like "hey can you stop forcing the parents of female children to make entire meals for boys in their grades they don't know, it's mysoginistic and it's creepy that you're forcing our children to act out archaic courtship practices" the school was like "we get what you're saying but it's sort of a tradition at our school" like YOU ARE LITERALLY IN CHARGE OF THE SCHOOL YOU HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THINGS THAT IS YOUR ENTIRE JOB
your mom is a bad bitch and i love it
my parents are both badasses they have basically spent most of my life going up to various versions of the establishment and being like "why are you doing this very bad thing"
We need more of your parents in this world
i mentioned this the other day but my dad was the only person in county government to read the entire police guidelines for the county sheriff and he wrote a 14 page dissertation of everything wrong with it and said "either start fixing this or i'm going to the new york times <3"
if you have tattoos of hate symbols, racial/ethnic or homophobic slurs, etc...
my town isnt really big enough that you can totally calculate living expenses because all the grocery stores are in other cities
but i will say that a house in my town just sold for 32 million
my family was extremely lucky with our timing buying my house because if we moved here today we would not be remotely able to afford it
OMG ITS ALBERTOOOO
@chandachan answer carefully, wrong response will result in a ban

Oh the wires suck
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t type is out. I sent it by mistake. But Anjali somehow got it
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re joking rn
I mean if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what you wanna do, you should be able to do whatever you want with your body
They aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even inherently sexual, people just make it out to be like that
And then act like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong
When it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not wrong whatsoever
wtf is this
Clifford could destroy raunak if he wanted to in a duel
Steal my identity if you want as long as I get a degree bro

@raunakwastaken are we still virtual friends
His family doctor said it was a bad idea
No he hates me
None of my friends will be on campus tho
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m used to it
Being told directly that they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna be friends with meü•∞
Anyway I had Hitchcock. Even the name sounds lame
No people occasionally play on the weekends but it got shut down fast because someone purportedly had covid in the group
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have a group
Awww dang
You think you can hurt me
But too late
Awwww noo
Dw about it I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m used to it
Raunak never hurts me LOLLLLLLL
This some juice.wrld type shit
What type of 1st grade crap is this
I could never get in between zhanda and raunak
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m Indian so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hella into bribes and shit
Bruh I thought you were jeff bezos√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ daughter don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even
I promise you nothing will break my threshold of what I find offensive
This dude really thinks making fun of my humor is the worst thing I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been toldüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
When did I think that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the worst thing you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been told
I can imagine people saying worse things to you
I am just making observations of your sad and cringe sense of humour
No need to imagine bro I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve likely been told them all√¢≈ì¬®
french ftw tho it is a bootiful language
but i dont think thats french
ur tired??
why are you tired??
my teacher is √•≈í‚Äî√§¬∫¬¨√§¬∫¬∫ and she's always like "god evan I wish I knew how you managed to go 6 years of mandarin classes with me and speak chinese like a train announcer instead of like √•≈í‚Äî√§¬∫¬¨√§¬∫¬∫"
im trying to translate
I think it's because i watch so many taiwanese dramas I speak with a super inauthentic clean accent lol
in middle school someone was like you can take french and i was like im literally fluent in spanish why would i learn the same language but worse üíÄ
pain au chocolate
i also went to france but that was long ago
The class sizes are super small; this semester I had a 12-person class
I DIDNT KNOW WHAT ENNUYEUX MEANT I WAS LIKE DID U JUST CALL ME A EUNUCH :eyes2:
is this some kind of slavic spelling joke im too bad at slovene to understand
"just chinese" cant you speak both cantonese and mandarin
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count dialects
According to my Japanese friends it never happened so
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what is time management
If you think you procrastinate, just remember that I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do over 2/3 my work at school until the day they were due
given i dont know either yea
but i don't know what specifics
But they just changed my major on paper to music and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if I have to audition
Because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m already an admitted student
i believe you might need to do an audition if u want to do music
if it doesn't say what school you were accepted to then you were just accepted to the university as a whole and your school is undeclared
i assume i was accepted into the school of engineering bc even though I dont recall seeing it on my app letter I did recently get an email from the head of the engineering department saying welcome to the engineering department
i dont exactly know the process for switching into nursing tho bc you get directly admitted into the school of nursing
@.bugcatcapoo did you enroll though?
i didn't enroll yet so maybe that's why i don't know? idk
Cuz you know it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s competitive
i was ED so i had 1 week to enroll before they told everyone else that I was a cuck and that they shouldnt trust me
ppl usually switch out tho
Isnt switching to nursing hard?
ron says she was messing around inside a body
Sorry I know I need Jesus
we also have community health nursing so we give like flu shots and health lesson plans to ppl in the greater cleveland area
and a soc class
To be fair I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just flown to Pittsburgh and do all my classes online but I just had to change my major and that takes some work
and all thru the years we have clinicals so like we are in the hospital working with patients from our 3rd week in first semester
for reference most schools dont start until 3rd year
Rip
i happi for u! it seems mucho coolio
and yea i said before anything below a 73 is a fail and u have to retake the class
and since every class is basically a prereq for everything else, this effectively puts u behind a whole year

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m kind of an idiot. is CE chemical engineering or computer engineering?
Oh Computer engineering

Idk why
My dad is allergic to cats and dogs so I cant have one
oh my

@everyone who wants me to donate a building in your name
@everyone writing my pregnancy announcement in #planning-bunker if anyone wants to read
either that or just writing a lot to build up hype idk
if anyone wants to hear the story about homie not drinking water and going to the hospital, I promise it did happen. I'm undefaned now and will be taking questions, although I may have to go soon.
That was me I forgot to drink water and my skin started turning flaky but luckily a dam found me alive in my room and he is a firefighter so he broke down the door with an axe and carried me outside  üòç and then thrrew me with one hand into the back of his pickup truck and drove me to university hospitals where I was able to get the proper treatment now me and him are happily.married with 3 kids
I'm sorry
heck yeah you are you failed csds 132 sorry
oh?
Wtf did u search to find this
damn I was trying to find that one but couldn't
What you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t kiss the homies good night anymore?
"this is a public school server"
I kinda just want to voice this rant right now: for someone who really wants to go into medicine my experiences as a patient is significantly negatively affecting it. Currently in the emergency room for like the 100th time this year because I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t move my neck and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in immense pain. Had to overdraft my card to order a Lyft because there were no ems available. Lucky me to be sitting in the emergency room on one of the most busiest days üòç. One side of me really wants to help others like myself but the other part of me is growing to hate the hospital.
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a bad idea at all xD
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry to hear that, I hope you feel better!! When you go into the field of medicine if you still choose to do so you can be the change
fuck, lupus is scary
feel better please!
What! It was supposed to never be lupus!
guess it's just taking a while then
its going i guess
it's cold, but sadly not enough for snow
lowest we get is being able to see our breath outside
is it within the possible? my clothing doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t declare the location
Idk I think it gives off the vibes of the t-shirt you receive when you check into summer camp in 4th grade
People in cle don't understand hiking boots unfortunately
wtf is wrong with everywhere outside of the west coast
they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand hiker boots
wtf
this is what happens when you live in a state without hills
Rain boots which are nowhere near as comfortable or practical
Cause they thin
imagine wearing literally anything except for hiking or work boots
How tf am I supposed to onewheel to work in a button up shit and slacks?
but real west coast kids would say how am I supposed to electric scooter my way to work
I literally don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even live in a town with electric scooters and I would still say that
Yeah my town took the electric scooters away and I am v sad
YOU DONT KNOW ABOUT THE UNIPIPER
oh my god one fucking second
All my homies hate robotics people
"uhh yeah we need 16 hrs of 3d printing done in one night for a part that has to be installed tmrw"
see u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t run into this problem if you just steadfastedly refuse to 3d print anything literally ever at any time for any reason
3d printing is for desperate times, as much as I love it it's a pain in the ass
one of my mentors was always trying to get us to 3d print things and we were like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very endearing that you think we have the patience or wherewithal to press a button on the screen and then do something else for a day
also oh my god last year we got a laser cutter and when I was doing a virtual tour of the thinkbox the tour guide said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t laser cut polycarb because of the toxic fumes√¢‚Ç¨ and I
laser cut polycarb lol
Yeah they don't let you laser cut food either
It also sucks, the thinkbox laser engravers have safety features so you can't play laser chicken
wish my mom would do that
like mom don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t u see, the problems come from other ppl moving my shit around
I would know where everything was if ppl stopped fucking with my system mom
Its scary when I know where everything is
oh god that reminds me I still have the battery beak
I took it with me when our team ignored the school telling us not to go to Fresno and left with all our shit only to immediately get the competition cancelled. ah, march, when we thought people were overreacting to covid
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still in my bedroom I might never be able to get it back on campus
leave the lanyard dangling out of my pocket the way ppl do when they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re flexing their car keys

I'm stuck with using a multimeter and saying "well, that's close enough to 12V"

My family usually drives to Florida for the winter but by then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already left
Omg tyty

Miami Beach is more dead skin than sand at this point

when the defendants in courts swear they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll speak of the truth and nothing but the truth they were referring to me specifically
I shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have challenged myself with a hard word
then find someone else for the babi role, i'll just take the money
word meaning, study of
aunt mology keeps trying to study me :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat:
she wants to know where you come from
> when the defendants in courts swear they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll speak of the truth and nothing but the truth they were referring to me specifically
@moseslee  they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say they speak OF the truth they say they speak the whole truth of the truth would mean truth-adjacent which is not a good way to run your system
gosh is this what the Californians who don't come to Oregon do
you dont want any
no I don't
tastes terrible
> gosh is this what the Californians who don't come to Oregon do
@christmaslights  also js it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s almost possible Silicon Valley teens smoke even more weed than oregonians im ngl
maybe I just want to admire it on my shelf
Oregonians don't smoke weed
rip the school bathrooms
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have blunts that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dumb

one of these happened DURING COVID
***I KNOW LARGE GATHERINGS AND FIREWORKS ARE BOTH ILLEGAL AND IT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢S THE MIDDLE OF THE DRY SEASON IN A STATE THAT CATCHES ON FIRE QUICKER THAN A FRAG GRENADE BUT I WANT TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT IM GONNA IMPOSE THE GENDER BINARY ON MY KID***
the straights are at it again and this time it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s killing people and ruining lives
give everyone multiple reasons to visit the hospital!
water park near my town went bankrupt bc of it üíÄ
the state of California was like are you fucking kidding me???? we need that water to make almond milk
In Fresno my aunt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s plants all died lol
She started a vegetable farm and they all just dropped dead
almond milk is really bad for water conservation
if you are lactose intolerant don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use almond milk it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very bad
WHICH I DISCOVERED BECAUSE I DRANK SOY MILK AT SCHOOL BC I LIKEF THE FLAVOR AND THET ALWAYS HAD AN EXCESS BC THERE ARE LIKE 5 LACTOSE INTOLERABT KIDS AT MY SCJOOL but then I was like why do I feel like actual garbage constantly
just drink milk tho
abd then I stopped drinking the soy milk and suddenly I was healthy abd not feeling awful constantly and I was like oh
but our ice cream is milk substitute becayse otherwise my dad gives himself heartburn and then he can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep and then he bitches about it
also they make this vat grown fake milk that has some other sugar in place of lactose and that shit is actually really tasty I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ngl
they torture those poor innocent almonds. that milk is for their babies you monsters
maybe I'll study them in college
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure Australia is worse
A true patriot: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always someone worse√¢‚Ç¨
we only got rain
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t heard about fascists at least but it is my understanding that they are racist and their parliament is run by batshit insane libertarians
also u know ur country is bad when no one lives in the entire middle 95% of it basically
> they'll be adopted almonds
@christmaslights  oh well in that case go ahead shelter almonds need homes :(
oh Jesus why are there so many people in Florida
someone remove all those people from Florida
i dont believe they have an accent
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very upset by the fact u think I talk like a valley girl
also you forgot deep midwest
should we just cut off North Dakota and give them to the Canadians then
she hasnt been relevant since '99
Then you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist obviously
Wasn't the "I can see Russia from my house" line from the parody?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve sobered up and now I kind of wish I went to sleep before when I was sleepy from the booze
I don't think they're allowed here either but man is it loud outside
no they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re illegal except for commercial use and particularly during spare the air days and high fire danger days which means basically never anymore
and when the entire state isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in maximum lockdown they have fireworks shows on the coast over the water but like you know
oh for CHRIST√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢S SAKE SOMEONE IS SETTING OFF FIREWORKS
YOU FUCKING IDIOTS STOP IT :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat:
this year one of the fires was close enough that we could see the glow on the other side of the hills
basically everyone in town evacuated so that they could be in a place where they could breathe the air without inhaling a pound of soot
Ben Shapiro tts robot Im never using another artificial voice for anything ever again

Except I guess when @raunakwastaken calls me a snake he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Fr
Nah I dont want to talk

I need to remember to fix my profile later

I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even say anything worthy of being kicked
I just said I play splatoon 2 and then I said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t laugh at me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m being serious√¢‚Ç¨ and they booted me
Lol. Splatooon slaps tho
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe they would treat a prospective student like that classic msu
WTF

I still am not over them banning me wtf that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so weird
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lowkey the funniest thing that happened tonight
i miss the den :sadcat3:
they're closed
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have dunkin in my state which is honestly such a shame
California doesn't have dunkins ?
except actually they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve started to impose themselves
Damn that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sad
vs whatever the fuck u guys have instead of in n out
All we have is five guys and other crap
oh it seems to be evenly split
still like a hundred people yelling go white
at this college
dear liberals,
                     if plexiglass is used for "safety",
  why isn't it allowed in the laser cutter? :cutethonk: 
bevn shapiro

I have a strict no wimps allowed rule near my engraver
Sometimes I don't think the laser is working

Howdy is never offline

and a terrible mod :cursed_flushed:
Yea Evann hates brown people
what u think i cant afford the legal fees
You broke
my money
wtf
Sorry but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mine now
howdy keeps profiling me as a valley girl and it makes me uncomfortable
wtf how even dare you
someone doesnt know where DC is located
Cry?
cant do that part
sad
damn i didn't realize ohio was that close
adam, theres a reason seniors go to dc for a field trip
its close enough to pack everyone into a school bus
in california they just ship you out to DC as long as ur school has enough funding
put u on a plane
We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have valley girls here so I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
You can actually never do that
Cause it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s relative
not far enough north for a NW accent
Evan do you speak computer
"Stuart?? Euuuwhater you doing herre?!" is a meme at my school
they say "the 201" like fucking psychopaths who says highway names like they're exclusive that's so weird
you have no idea about the highway I live near
so it's not like i gave u information u didnt already know
oh what the fuck it's called I-280 but it literally only exists in silicon valley
I = interstate smh my head
i thought 280 ran longer than that
looks like adam has a bad case of the zhanda's rn
oh it's because once you cross the bridge I-280 turns into I-80 and then runs into nevada
i tried to fix it and i made it worse
oh no i mean the [REDACTED] bridge in Seattle
so sad u redcated that otherwise i might have found out about the one bridge in seattle you know
you are always allowed to shit on your hometown, however I will judge you
everything else about sf is pretty much exclusively terrible
every time i want to go to some kind of an event like a drag show or anything i have to drive an hour and then spend another hour finding a parking spot, then step out onto the gray lifeless streets and breathe in the smell of tobacco and millenial depression as people vape in my face and run away startled if they see someone smiling
i tried to join the boy scouts once and the scout leader essentially hate crimed me
no servers to mod when your plane crashes
plane crash survivor discord server
unfortunately the boy scouts are run by homophobic bible thumpers so
no... plane crash servers are ones will dirt, trees, and poisionous berries. Worst of all there are no costcos and a lot of hills
i had actually never
been inside of a costco
until last year
and it's not even because im rich there just isnt one in my area
I DONT EVEN SHOP AT WHOLE FOODS
i would not even fucking hesitate to roundhouse kick jeff bezos in the neck
im allowed to still hate the 1% i've spent my whole life around them i've seen pretty much everything wrong with the bourgeois
fucked up system i benefit from i dont like him very much
nop, we arent valley girls
but there is nothing i would love more than a man who negs me and then calls my sons the f slur because they're bad at soccer
cant guarantee that's a jake paul move it just seems like his MO
havent you heard
nah, its the working side of college, you wont find a single girl down there
yeah adam didnt u know women cant get jobs in IT??? estrogen chemically interacts with computers and makes bad things go wrong
dont you mean gender studies
It's to prove estrogen doesn't make computers explode shhhhh
evan, thats far too outlandish, i think you mean the gender gap doesnt exist because there are no genders, there are humans and lizard ppl from mars
I mean, CS majors are pussy tho
FUCK the gender binary, im going to jupiter to get more stupider
girls dont exist
that sounds like math
math bad
reject math
sad
oof ouch ur bones
ouch your mom
ouch it is so cramped in this womb oof owie

OH SHIT
I DIDNT EVEN FUCKING INTELLECTUALIZE THAT AS A POSSIBILITY

soooooo boring
@raunak that didnt even make sense
*should* be but my teacher's voice has the same endless drone as a fly pathetically smacking into a wall as it reaches the last hour of its life
don't fite kidz
Awwww
:clifford: i hate this one
@kaori_flute wants the cat gun to herself
i need to find blurryeyes
omg
Bruh we need thicc thanos

one time my pal tied to stress a √â‚Ñ¢ and I was like sorry bud can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be done
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you have finals coming up?
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean to call you out like this
the u in that sentence???? a fucking √â‚Ñ¢
why dont we acknowledge him
√â‚Ñ¢ is so fucking powerful dude
the u in fuck is also a √â‚Ñ¢
oh my god the shit that comes up when you search √â‚Ñ¢ is so blessed
a lot of this content seems to be korean i wonder if there's an underground movement to write the korean vowel [eo] as /√â‚Ñ¢/
dude dont even get me started on √â
Pls don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
√â doesnt even have a name
wtf kind of a name is near-open central vowel smshmmsmhm
im not smoking anything except for the good news of √â‚Ñ¢
english language could survive without √É¬¶
also √É¬¶ doesnt have his own name
for those of u who are uninitiated bachelor fantasy is a game where you watch ABC's *The Bachelor* and *The Bachelorette* except with the twist that you've selected 5 people for a team and get points when they get in catfights, wear culturally insensitive costumes, get drunk, or cry
it's fucking incredible
how many brain cells does the show make you lose though
sometimes it means you have a drinking problem altho after the incident they don't let them get as drunk anymore which btw made the show a LOT less entertaining
i know its bad if i cant tell if this is a circlejerk or not
the reason bach fantasy exists is because eventually people realized that making a drinking game would result in alcohol poisoning
they havent had interesting seasons since the incident
which makes me really sad
and then they were like uhhh chad got drunk and threatened to murder chris harrison and then immediately afterward an intern sued us for being forced to watch two contestants have sex SOOOOOOO you can only have one glass of wine every hour and now it's like ugh
no queer men allowed because being a gay man isn't sexy for straight men to think about
math suc
im the only person i know at my school who plays bach fantasy altho some people do seem to watch it unironically which is beyond tragic
teacher im TAing for didnt give me her zoom link but watch her get pissed at me anyway
how did i end up TAing a class with the two only other ppl named evan in the entire school
turns out the teacher doesnt respect me and wont let me do anything and i literally hate her so i am going to rework my entire schedule to TA for a teacher i actually like
so they brought in a new guy to be the bachelor instead of bringing back someone who was already on the show once
he said like 3 words the entire episode and had a very vacant expression I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not confident about my team anymore
i dont think that was ever not considered
which I would die for
i don't play fantasy anything
I find it really weird how the maga protestors aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t getting the same treatment as blm... not that any protest should get that but ... interesting how this country work :pensiveok:
Hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it started calming down?
doesn't mean it's going to stop
Rep Omar suggested she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s drawing up articles of impeachment already
I want Trump gone yes
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re 2 weeks out
Ah fair fair
Even when Trump is gone, he has really left a mark on this country. Many people are still gonna be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTrumpian√¢‚Ç¨ and will push on his kind of attitude towards politics
To be openly stupid and racist
They won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listen lol
make it so they are the only people left that aren't educated
It will be IMPERATIVE that Biden's promises come to life. If the Dems waste having the presidency, House, and Senate and don't deliver on their promises, GOP is gonna have a big comeback in 2022 and 2024.
The fact that Georgia went blue completely is insane, and they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t waste it
if u want history to b recorded, u gotta record it
yeah if u dont write it down no other record of her election will exist
i want this lady in textbooks
they dont keep track of these things
you jest evan, but its shocking how much history can be lost
hell, i didn't know what juneteenth was until summer of 2019
think what else we could all be missing right now
oh we're def missing a lot
im extremely lucky to have gone to such a boujee school because for the past two years i have been learning people's history lmao
like when i was in the public school system they were basically teaching me the exact opposite of what ive been taught at my high school
last year was us history and instead of learning about like
wow the founding fathers uwu
with the goal being that because you have been taught about these things u wont fall for alt right propaganda
just pretends didnt happen
also, that sounds like us hist 2, over here it was broken down  into 1/2s first 1/2 being origins up to civil war
these tech people.... they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re having so much fun making AI they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not considering that soon humans won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to find employment at all anymore
can't teach a robot to be an EE
at least not yet
horrifyingly close to that
also you know shits bad when I agree with rand paul on something
the only decent republicans left in the party tbh
it takes some serious cajones to directly defy your party like that
Literally wtf happened today in DC I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m lowkey scared about it
As in i know what happened but
Im actually so scared because after trump there will be someone even worse down the line
and once he's gone, it'll all go away 
*hopefully*
But yeah, this has shown that people can go this far and nothing will be done to stop them
clearly they will stop at nothing to hold on to their sad pathetic remnants of a disgraceful era in American history
I'm sincerely holding onto all the hope I have that once they lose their fuel or their leader, they'll essentially go away
nah 4 years of hyping them up? won't go away for a while
they may never replicate Trump's charisma as well but they exist
I think Hawley, Blackburn and the other 11 should be tried for treason
it's a shame the death penalty only applies for treason
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m like the air bud of pointed rebellion
turns out I got a D+ in AP physics last semester which is a fail
nah I just feel lazy
oh damn
that seems like kinda an extreme measure?
my school is the CEO of extreme measures
damn Pennsylvania teachers be on some next level shit
that kid deserves an oscar if its fake tho
I didn't even play video games at that point, but I knew what I had to do
another guy got alien hand syndrome and ended his presentation with pretending to strangle himself with his hand
it's him trying to stick the remote up his ass for me üíÄ
lol. It's still 100% more entertaining than jake paul or shit like that, therefore I accept it.
Does anyone want to write my math essay
why would you write an essay in math
it's 10% of my grade and if I weren't worried about getting into college, I'd just not do it
history teacher didnt actually sign me on as a TA or reply to my email but I showed up to his class and he was like
"god damn it evan"
someone should copy and paste the thing evan found a while ago
I want pizza
ah wait nvm i can't acces the options now since leutner is closed
oh
and sth called stir fry
someone told me that theres only tofu available if youre vegetarian
these arent that bad
i guess so
but it can get very repetitive if u rely on that after sometime
they don't sound bad but the quality will not be good
you can't legally marry yet beta
sigh
im not sure tbh
i think they're normal swipes
cuz cafe bonappetit is just campus food
forgot
should i be worried? :Monka:
ipod
oh my god i just realized how old they were
so basically nothing there is accurate?
if u keep scrolling bruh it gets worse
oh man all of these are super old
i mean a lot of this seems like stuff that really could describe any college but idk man it's pretty possible this is just like a group of buds who decided to raid urban dictionary in 2005-06
and not the virtual school mfs üôÑ
holy shit this guy is PISSED
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m far superior in helping
idk
ik it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhard√¢‚Ç¨
class selection
some classes are some classes aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. for me personally it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good balance of a challenge but not like death
i get worried when i read shit like, unmanageable workload
some profs should never be allowed to teach but most have been really really good. i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had one bad one
he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a math professor
he bad?
just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t teach or spell
i took AP Calc AB and got a 5 but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember much so i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t skip
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had bad math teachers my whole life btw
u just gotta like know your limits. like don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take too many classes or get into too many clubs. find a nice balance
is it bad if i just focus on academics first semester or smn
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna miss out on anything
but i rlly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to overdoe it
not at all! a lot of people i know didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do clubs the first semester
i think there should be plenty of time for me to become an EMT, research/volunteer/shadow and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to rush into it
yeah don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t burn yourself out
i get worried when i hear unmanageable because the worst thing for me is having to prioritize between classes and which ones i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢mma skip hw for or studying which is a bad strategy
like people are dumb and go get drunk instead of studying and then say it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unmanageable
Doubt neuro majors would encounter fidalgo though?
Yeah neuro doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t require that
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what most freshmen do. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one semester. Wont kill ya
Ah damn I have to take them both
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
I have so many math reqs
No more actual math til senior year for meüòé
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
Even though pscl 282 and engr 131 are quantitative classes
Imma pretend I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read that
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t comment on physics yet
Since I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take it seriously in hs
Math is really important for CS though so it would be very odd not to have a lot of math requirements
lol y'all think CS math requirements are bad
CS actually requires more math classes than the EE major; the differences are that EE requires diff eq and CS requires discrete math and linear algebra. The EE major classes are very mathematical though from what I've heard
you need linear algebra for ee too
there's a girl in my class who took all three of these already in hs :blurryeyes:
she was in BC freshman year so she got to enroll in all of our post-ap math classes she's lowkey a genius
actually she's like a DND character that poured all of her points into int and none into wis because she was in diff eq at age 15 but also she said she wanted to try bird cheese and she didnt know that butter had dairy in it
Guys @nobelium19 is a 4th year PhD student in pure math, so if you have any questions concerning mathematical concepts in your courses, please feel free to direct them to him as he is a2lwaus obliged to respond to you
it doesn't because it has no payload
my dad left me alone in the car while he went to get our takeout so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m being a public nuisance

cause I think it would help if the mods were given a role color so they could be distinguished from everyone else if someone needs to ask for help or has ideas to help make the server better
(If you need help in doing that kind of stuff Im really experienced with running servers so I can help)
which idk if its pingable
tho it should be
moderation isn't required just yet
sucks to be me
be annoying and kept pinging ppl on the server
zhanda never stops
sorry meg
yeah we're not looking into putting mods in a distinctive category because it's not worth it yet. Since this is a very small server there is no need to do fancy stuff. If arguments happen or someone is trolling feel free to ping us!
and ya theres hardly anyone in here so i dont think its as big of a deal yet
i dont disagree but i also dont think theres a lot of need to be pinging a mod now since theres not a lot of stuff happening
again i'm not sure there is a need for that yet because this is a very small server
fair fair
The only ones that I'm actually semi-proud of are Newsies, Les Mis, Comedy of Errors but in the Roaring 20's, and Loves Labors Lost but in the "surfer dude" era
well half a year i guess
i dont have access to the 25 facebook which is where i feel like any others would be posted as well
i feel like if u have a bigger server with not very many mods thats a decent amount to manage tho
again, like meg said, this is a very small server and we don't see a need for that yet. Shall the server become bigger and we feel the need to add such features, we will do that
i dont have a reddit account though
oh what
cuz randos joined apparently
no other cwru server has had that problem before so idk what happened w that one
only prob is im '25 so i cant access the '24 server lol
theres no rule saying u cant
we don't have a verification system there tho so lol
even tho we should've
23 doesnt either
our server is mostly dead tho
unless ur just planning to fail for many many years
exam on the fourth
is this a j term class?
oh what class
tbh this quiz is basically an ochem and basic bio review so its not bad but like uhghgh
which is an 18 credit sem and i dont feel like
besides taking this class now makes me not have 2 8:30ams and a lab after an 8 hour clinical
cuz the 3 credit class i had planned for then, im taking it this semester now
which would suck major ass
9-1 class
idk if i said this before but my clinical site is on a colorectal surgery floor üò≠
Oh that was me
every time I look at it, I feel this horrible urge to go listen to the jingle
It's still weird looking at the reverse order after having kids4kars for so long
like a cheap knock-off of a car
and college students because man would ramming someone with a cardboard kar be great
Then the college administration people have to figure out how to stop campus road rage
since someone will inevitably get beat up because they rammed someone or h O N K E D at them
Kar parts are smuggled into campus in the late hours of the night
The poor students try to make an actual car but no, the mysterious buyers are looking for cardboard monstrosities
After getting used to the idea they come together, engineering students using their knowledge and skills to make the grandest, most terrifying cardboard kar anyone has ever rammed someone with
Said battles become the most popular event on campus, but nobody can actually prove they happened because the parts are always cleaned up by morning
Elite crews are hired to find the most efficient ways of removing all evidence of the nightly battles
Yet their grades still stay up, because the underground market for cheat sheets and other methods has grown substantially
However, they can never come back, lest anyone investigate the reason behind their disappearance
The battles become increasingly cutthroat: a path to becoming a legend, but one misstep leads to you leaving campus forever
A new business sprouts: those trying to find out the identities of the participants
All while the professors work to uncover their secrets
A tired admin worker who seems to always be one step behind the kars community
I so wish there were, that'd be fun to do
not always tho
that i can't predict but when i appealed to northeastern they gave me 5k/year more
I wish you luck in that
Public school tuitions are much more attractive in this regard x)
Yeah, affordability has been my biggest issue in applying to colleges. Case was really generous, but I'll still need a bit more to go. My EFC is five times what my family can actually pay, so I've been relying on merit.
My plan's been to load up on scholarships and hope that makes up enough of the difference
May we both get the money we need
waiting for the fUCKING MAILMAN TO LEAVE SO I CAN GET MY MAIL
he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally just sitting in the car

These quotes make me feel smarter
Quoting Marie Antoinette who got freaking beheaded
for like 4 straight seasons it was UNREASONABLY BORING
i'm just awake at 3am :cri:
Oh oop, didn't notice the role
I want full tuition but competitions scare me
that's scary
I'm submitting mine in like an hour
haven't thought about it since
its as easy or hard as u make it, there are jobs out there, but they *usually* wont come to u. The school provides a "handshake" account which is supposed to help w/ job searching, but I havent had any sucess with it. This may be due to rona tho, idk
I won't just be an IKEA shark
That movie gave me my first ever nightmare it was horrible. I was in kindergarten I think
considering switching to going by my middle name in college because as much as I like my name I am getting really tired of people either misgendering me or THINKING they are DELIBERATELY misgendering me as female because they assume I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a trans man
would it be internalized sexism if I switched to annie though idk
Poor girl
Who wants to go to the temple w meüòÄ
lol idk what that is
Oh no
rip
rip
you are a beauty prinkles
no need
we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re probably gonna start panels soon bc ed2 is out but if u want a party @avocrados there are options for that :tyrone: :tyrone:

The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Start.
imagine required PE classes in college
My highschool doesn't require PE class
We have to do an after school activity though
If it's a required after-school activity, could you count that as technically still being part of school?
i guess
this time at least pge didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deliberately shut it off it went down on its own
wtf, don't hospitals have power backup for that?
@an_old_moose idk but the school is on the same grid as me so class might be cancelled unless they manage to rejoin the internet
we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re running on backup generators but the internet is down
our school doesn't have backup generators for anything but the on campus datacenter
Rip, no school sounds fun tho
@an_old_moose hospitals have backup power but it lasts for 48 hours and shut offs can be up to 4 days
damn... :// that's not ideal
How do you go for 4 days without power lol
yeah PGE has gone bankrupt multiple times but they keep getting bailed out by the government
what the fuck am i doing with my life
fair warning: college snap groups die QUICK
why didn't you make it infinite
like a link that never expires
so ppl don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spread it around
oh shit now my cell might be down too
ok he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s up just very slow
aight fuck this school shit imma play animal crossing
yeah stop worrying about college
well looks like the school√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s power is still up AP physics is running smoothly with half of its students not connected
Omg who else got the goods
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry but this is a waste of trees
I feel like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going through an indoctrination process √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe promise an exhilarating, intense 4 years of intellectual expansion and self-exploration√¢‚Ç¨
Tbh it feels like such a scam
Like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so mad one of my friends goes to John Carroll and the dorms are nicer and more affordable

Tesla probably wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t into vampires
*I dont blame you, the current series have been awful*
oh my god I completely missed the following paragraph
like hold on let me carefully inspect this pigeon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cloaca to check that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not gay that I literally want to fuck it
\*kinkshames greatest EE to have lived\* 
\*Goes to kinkiest engineering school in country\*
weird enough shit that ppl in cults and conspiracy theorists groups and alternative medicine circles
Idk duddee.
history didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t prove
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not saying Tesla wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a genius my entire argument is he was very smart and had many great ideas but he was also a nut job and I totally believe he fell in love with a pigeon
Don't make him crazy
Need citation
Generally you don't trust crazies for that stuff
I don't see your argument
tesla waa a genius inventor, an incredible engineer, and a brilliant scientist. he also used his Tesla coils to bubble ozone through gel to make therapeutic mixtures, believed that running an electric current through the walls of classrooms would have medicinal, therapeutic, and psychic effects, claimed to have invented a death ray that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist, and most notably he demonstrated the concept of a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthought camera√¢‚Ç¨ (which supposedly took data from your memories out of your retinas and projected them onto a screen) at a birthday party he held with his friends
and I followed that by sarcastically saying that I would not put it past him to fall in love with a bird and somehow you turned it into a debate in which you tried to dismantle my personal fact-based opinion that nikola tesla was simultaneously very smart and competent and also totally crazy
Im not telling you to defend anything I simply gave my opinion and you felt the need to answer it
every time I said I thought he was both smart and crazy you responded by saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwell but he was smart√¢‚Ç¨ as though I was arguing that he wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t smart, or that his intelligence should be disregarded bc he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s crazy
I don't think I was so clear
I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t kinkshame him if I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consider him my pal
No need to defend yourself
about CRAZY SHIT because he was a LOSER WEIRDO and I ADORE HIM
stupid little GOBLIN MAN
I just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t love things without also getting really involved with their flaws and vehemently defending them by making fun of those flaws and that can send mixed messages to ppl
I imagine I'll fall.in love w. Something as stupid as a small bird
Sorry for the wrong signals on my end then
Idk
Poor guy had a tough life
idk he pretty much was about as eccentric as you can get
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGenius inventor Nikola Tesla was kicked out of an apartment after he spent an unreasonable amount of money taking care of pigeons and ppl complained√¢‚Ç¨ god what a sentiment. I aspire to that energy
wolfram alpha and I are in a committed relationship and if u seduce away from that path then you WILL regret it
R u trying to kinkshame polyamory?
Damn
and mostly they will regret it for not CLEARING IT WITH ME BEFOREHAND stupid wolfram alpha what a slut
I literally hate all kinks sorry
Might have missed it
I need it for hw
Damn.
difference between polygamy between consenting adults and one person in a relationship cheating on a monogamist and honestly given that wolfram usually has all the right answers Id be dismayed if he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that
Damn straight. He takes tangents on my curves all day
Nah I'm bad at english
I'm sorry; is there a right answer?
idk how many c√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s is ur thicc
damn true
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably why there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so much miscommunication in texting
bc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like I DONT KNOW WHAT TONE OF VOICE U USED WHEN U SAID THAT :crii: :crii: :crii: :crii: :crii: :crii: :crii:
Sadly ya. So try :(
Oh no
I grew up speaking Spanish and English and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been studying mandarin for the past 7 years
having gone through the entire first 5 and a half and a half levels of HSK I can confidently say I am barely serviceable at mandarin
that language has so many nuances of speech you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learn out of textbooks or from 20-year-out expats so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just embraced that I sound like a slightly robotics train announcer
Technically translates to i don't not not not not not ... Not want to eat
It's terrible for being specific
SO U WILL EITHER BE EXTREMELY LITERAL OR RIDICULOUSLY POETIC AND NO INBETWEEN
I write simplified I can never remember which one that is
I don't have a Chinese kb on my phone :(
Chinese make some sad tho honestly
The characters don't allow you to know how to phonate other dialects
You're stuck w the same character set rly
but they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t change it now bc they put an insane amount of effort into spreading literacy with the current system over the past few hundred years and if they changed systems it would decentralize the language and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not the sort of thing that the CCP wants happening in their iron-fist Orwellian language control
You'd be surprised to know french is the same unfortunately
it SOUNDS like how a snail moves AND IT MEANS WORK COW ITS SO BLESSED
Cuz they sound excellent
I LOVE THAT WHEN OLD LADIES DROP THINGS THEY SAY √¢‚Ç¨≈ì***TERRIBLE***√¢‚Ç¨ IT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢S SO BLESSED
Wasn't learning that word
pencil fell on the ground? zaogao
fell in a hole and died? zaogao
Sorry it was a sketch I watched from SNL
like now when things go wrong im like THIS IS AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER
I literally use mandarin words in english when english sucks too much
i just feel like there's something really visceral and wholesome about treating everything like a worldending threat like somehow it manages to make everything seem less dramatic
to be like "this is the worst thing ever" to literally everything because it comforts you to overblow it
You speak English in mandarin class?!
For shame!
like my friend ansa and i when we were talking to each other in robotics we would speak pretty much in a pidgin without even fucking realizing it bc the languages are so different that put together they  cover pretty much every use
I mean OUTSIDE OF CLASS smh dummy
ACTUALLY MY SCHOOL OFFERED A TRIP TO CHINA bc we're boujie ignore that detail it doesnt matter
U went?
BUT WHEN WE WERE IN CHINA TG ANSA AND I SPOKE SO MUCH MANDARIN TOGETHER AND WITH LOCALS THAT WE *FORGOT HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH*
like we went to get hotpot and one of my friends who doesnt speak chinese was sitting at our table
and i said "use mine I got so much that it's not enough one person"
Sadly
I can't think in language nymore
so like i had a 30 minute conversation with a very sweet old chinese man in a tea shop and then realized halfway in that my friend didnt understand ANYTHING we were saying
I don't think in internal monologue and afaik i never have??? but like i simulate internal monologue by generating characters who talk at me and they usually speak english
but i imagine if i lived in china for long enough it would transform into being in chinese
Idk if you went to any villages there
And holy shit it's 10000x
but like among the older generation ppl are really polite and patient and among young ppl theyre like you speak like an idiot and i dislike that you're trying to communicate with me in a language you're bad at
see im like a more boring white person bc i have dark hair and my glasses hide my pale eyes
BUT I HAVE TO SAY when we broke into smaller groups I was in a group with a mexican guy with a long braid, ansa who is half-white, myself, and our Chinese native friend chelsea so that must've been an exciting mix of ppl to interact with
we went to Beijing, Xi'an, and Shanghai
and the last day in Shanghai we went to a village out of town floating on the river
It gets sooo hard
there's such a tragic dearth of chinese tongue twister content on the american internet
the guy with the guitar lowkey has a really bad accent it's kind of tragic
I mostly learned working in china
my teacher loves the guy on the left bc he sounds like a beijingren trying to get someone to buy his knockoff gucci belt
Ppl usually thought I was chinese over the phone tho
I want to take russian lolol
im trying to collect all the language groupps
Russians hard
altho learning hindi could be useful bc a friend of mine speaks urdu
my friend speaks urdu and if i want to marry her
i will need to speak urdu as well
well i need to keep my options open albert
maybe not as hard as chinese but still
ppl i speak chinese to who are native speakers have a hard time with my accent in chinese bc it's 75% fake chinese that no one speaks outside of Tdramas shipped overseas and 25% confused american child
sorry moses but I'm only learning useful languages üôà
apparently all the slavic words left over in slovene sound super archaic to ppl who speak other languages
i'll probably still do it to stick it to my racist grandma who i hate
Sorry for being nosey
altho maybe it's mean to learn slovene just to spite her becaus ethe fact that she was shippe dout of her country of birth for having germanic heritage isnt her fault
your grandma probably will hate that more
most people in europe hate poland
bc yugoslavia had kind of a casual ethnostate thing going on after the war that ppl dont really like to talk about
and u might think "wow but she's rich so it must've been a real american dream story for her!" BUT no she just married a man with a lot of money in hospital real estate
and then abused her three children and told my mom that if she was lucky my dog would eat rat poison and then spent 8-9 years making my brother cry
and it's like does her childhood trauma explain her behavior? yeah. does it excuse it? no, fuck that woman
she's racist and she's a bully and the results of her parenting continue to have effects on my generation even though we didnt live with her as children
and it's because of her that my dad is incapable of processing his own emotions and instead just shuts them off and pretends they arent there which is literally only something he can get through functionally because he's intelligent enough to approximate empathy intellectually
if we were lucky, that he would eat rat poison and die
i dont give a fuck about her and i dont like being around her and when she dies i will feel nothing but a sense of overwhelming relief
and that is a level of passionate hatred that i have never applied to anyone else in my life
im sorry for oversharing but i HATE MY GRANDMA SHE IS SO AWFUL
ANNIE'S GRANDMA HATE PARTY
and to be clear this isnt me like having a super emotional meltdown over my grandma so u dont have to be like oh i dont know what to say just say lmao yeah ur grandma sucks #anniesgrandmaisoverparty :uniqua::uniqua: because honestly that's the appropriate energy
ive been learning slovene online and i tried to learn russian online but the thing is russian is a language with conjugation and formality and honorifics and it's like duolingo isnt qualified to teach me this
Russian hard
Tho
Is j ppl obsessed w self misery and pain
Arguably related to finish tho
idk i just think it's neat
Russia needs some alan watts
Hahahaha oh
but the only train running out of the town has stopped arriving, food prices steadily skyrocket, there's a genocide of the steppe natives happening behind the scenes and the entire theme of the game is that fate can't be avoided and that inevitably all things die
it's SO FUCKING RUSSIAN DUDE
We shld all hv more fun dying
i strongly recommend it but also don't play it it's a bad game and it takes a very particular sort of person to be able to play it and don't play it it's bad. it's a great game but it's ba
Wtf is a this? ^
U j don't want me to judge it/u
Aww √¢¬§√Ø¬∏
Where's the players pain come in?
and only 1 of them has actually purchased the game and he hasnt played it yet
Oh
Cuz u get invested
And then ur children die?
every time you die they make the game harder
they'll take away a slice of your life and then also make your hunger run out faster or make you die of exhaustion faster or something
it's part of the themeing about how death is unavoidable
Russia sucks.
you get punched in the face and you die
and then when you die the game punishes you
if you load an old save it will put you back in the time and place but it remembers how many times you died in total
and so it keeps your modified stats
because it gets you really emotionally invested in the choices you make even though ultimately they have no impact
if i do one choice this character might die, but if i do the other choice i or another character might die, or i might lose reputation and people will start shanking me inb the street
choices become really difficult and because the choices are hard because of their impact on your ability to win you start getting genuinely invested in it
hold on i'll dm u the video essay you might find the analysis interesting even if you dont want to play the game lolol
I feel like I'd like the game tho
I thought this chat was supposed to be dead
WHY IS HE STOMPING FROG THAT US SO SAD
dumb sadcat frog he die
it takes literal weeks
I still didn't get mine and its been like three weeks
bruh i never introduced myself just realized üò≠
:sad:
i want a cat
ur getting dabbed on so hard
idk is weir
goodbye
bye
and cuz we no nitro gang
i'm trying to not be as active UwU
so prolly won't get gifts
fair :PepoThink:
i spent 4 hours redrafting and finalizing the main character for my comic and then i drew gleb in 30 seconds and he was an instant classic
can't help doing the same
started off with one of the contestants saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sad about how the fact that I called another woman a hooker and it ruined her life√¢‚Ç¨ like wow
and then she started crying
at least it looks like he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s getting rid of her he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not falling for her basically saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so different from the person I was at the beginning of this conversation and I am extremely sad about the things I said about other people literally yesterday√¢‚Ç¨
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe other girls are fake as shit and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not his wives√¢‚Ç¨
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe house is gonna feel like shit that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gone I brought so many people joy. Matt is not the guy for me, like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never dating another Matt. Like I hate that name now√¢‚Ç¨
Needless to say I wont be anywhere near this show anytime soon
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gotten better in recent years. this year I genuinely feel like the next bachelorette could be an Asian woman but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still unlikely because ABC only recently discovered the existence of black people
Which has problems of its own
And I hate that
but yeah I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recommend this franchise to anyone who is not able to get over the placement of people into extremely reductive and problematic stereotypes because that is like the entire ethos of the show
I get really angry about it I just watch the show bc I need something in life to get mad at
oh
I hate the culture of ignorance around my race
I have so many broken fingers over the years
pretend u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand the joke
be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsorry I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get why that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s funny, can you explain?√¢‚Ç¨
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fucking
I mean also you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re [negative trait] for a [protected category] is extremely bad and an uncomfortably common form of negging but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t and never will have time to get into the deliberate shaming and manipulation of bisexual women
like the implication that some racism is ok specifically bc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not as bad as other racism is so fucking detestable as a concept
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why trans and non-gay queer ppl get so disproportionately abused and yet simultaneously told that their problems are made up
and why ppl still use racial slurs for a lot of smaller protected categories without even realizing that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re racial slurs
and also why there are like a million targeted slurs against women and the concept of femininity that are still used in vernacular English heyoo
things that are bad:
- Asians
- women
- men who I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think are masculine enough
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand why ppl will spend so much energy on being racist or misogynistic like what do you stand to gain from saying things you know are inherently hateful and untrue
if u know the entire point of ur joke relies on the use of harmful stereotypes that target ppl specifically bc of a group they belong to or that you think it would be inherently bad for them to be a member of
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t?? make the joke???
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand
also placing the fact that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re  upset about something blatantly racist that they said on you, like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your fault that they said something upsetting, is a horrifically shitty thing of them to do @moseslee
but if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re targeting a friend of mine I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let it slide
and also if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re saying things in a public space like in a classroom or smth bc I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want other ppl in the classroom to pick up what they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re saying and think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true or ok
bc usually those ppl are searching for a reaction and if they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get one they will gooooo awayyyy
I wish people were like that
Because it would indicate they know right from wrong
mostly I guess the idea is if someone is unwilling to change their behsvior when you try to have a calm conversation with them about why it his harmful
Honestly tho, I find i need triple a so much more
Fuck American Airliens
imagine having a car
Most of the time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just get in someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s car
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a 17 hour commute if you start biking back as soon as you get home you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll only miss one day of class
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll leave my last will and testament on your doorstep howdy
u might get hate crimed tho
but unlikely you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll end up dead in a ditch if that helps
hate crimed
That reminds me of the time I saw someone on reddit say √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t date non whites because I like tall guys√¢‚Ç¨
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t date non whites because I like guys who work out√¢‚Ç¨
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve lost so many brain cells
bad website
I wonder if i can still do BME
dead for the money
> dead for the money
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a thing ppl say
But don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a dickhead!
sorry that was a stupid joke even for me
idk why ppl think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ok to make it into a race thing all the time
or sorry don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like short guys
I guess it probably goes the other way too it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s similarly arbitrary
I HATE TALL GUYS PPL OVER 5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢8 DNI
women smh my head
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true all women are bad at video games
see what I mean I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know the lingo apparently
ac as in air conditioning
my house doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that
so calm the fuck down, u big baby
damn u got me there
YouTube seems to have decided that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a Spanish-speaker with erectile dysfunction anf I would absolutely adore to know what specific part of my watch history gave them that impression
so I guess if I look at it that way they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing a spectacular job
why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t everything just be a nice tepid and mildly uncomfortable 80√Ç¬∞ at all times
scream longer. breathe harder
You can!!!!!!! If you really want to
Lol I am scared because I am not the most hands on person and I feel like my brain mainly works for cellular/tissue engineering discipline because I like to learn about processes and Idek much about coding to really know computation!!!!!
AP biology or AP College Biology
so college biology
i just want to know what would best prepare someone for bme
i mean im still looking into possible degrees
Oh then a bio major!
But idk what interests you in bio particularly
@moseslee she's on mobile she cant see which messages ur responding to
Oh sorry mean bio lol
But idk I think bio may suit your interest better
khan academy is probably a good place to go. i imagine AP chem is gonna get you want you want. idk what the difference between AP chem and AP college chem is
Oh lolllll
Still searching lollll
I used it last year
@fbi sorry
I am scared too haha. But I think the biomaterials or tissue engineering discipline is more theory and lab work
yeah you seem more geared toward research than toward tech development
though the job market is something to think about
Yeah BME may be better for jobs... idk much about the macromolecule engineering thingy but it seems to be advancing
Oh yeah polymers seems coop$
I cannot type apparently
So I guess that is the difference
if i do that then goodbye leukemia
Similar courses tho
goodbye all cancers actually
very specialized equipment rather than generalized computer programming
i want to minimize physics
and math
i mean i guess im down to learn computer programming too? cuz its the future
math u will still probably get a hefty portion of in both
i mean i can manage math just don't give me really weird stuff like complex numbers
certain disciplines of bme use less math than others. if u go into computation you will need a lot more math
computation requires discrete math
teach computer how play chess math
I don't mind math as much anymore. Kind of have grown to like it. I used to hate it before lol.
as long as you dont go into the computation discipline u shouldnt have to do too much crazy math but it does also mean youll learn less complex coding @moseslee
so money is a bit hard to come by in raw bio
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrible though
Cuz their research is the brains behind multiple tech industries
unfortunately in this capitalist hellscape u get paid only if someone notices ur work and is interested in it so you can spend a long time working on something only to have it misrepresented by some conservative think tank
i mean obviously you get paid. but it's hard to get funding
Feel like being a bloodthirsty Washington DC guy
would not b surprised if she's a flat earther but idk what a flat weather would even entail
she's probably flat weather too tho tbf
but apparently
"we dont know what's down there"
as president i will live stream everything i do in the oval office
those damn penguins have it coming.
damn u really fucking owned them dude
imagine being a bme major literally could never be me
the joke (keyword joke) about bme is if you go into BME, one parent is a doctor and the other is an engineer and you don't want to disappoint either
Rip......
seems super correct nothing wrong here im a bme major im majoring in majoring it's postmodernism get off me
studying the impact of the creation of the wheel
so far my theory is that it helped a lot. havent ruled that one out for sure
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very good one next to my home and I gonna miss it
Can someone help me clean my mess :pablo:
guys üò© i forgot to share
OMG hope you all feel better Jen!!
i cant leave my room
Wallahi bro i'm so tired
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already a class of 2025 instagram but it hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t posted anything yet so I dm'ed the account asking if it was active on tuesday last week and still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten a reply, should I make a new account or wait? basically every other college√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s co 2025 instagram has a lot of posts
I made an account the @ is casewestern.2025 if anyone wants to help me run it lmk and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll message you the log in information
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think the account will need any memes as of right now
Fuck I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have nitro
my hot pocket just split in half down the exact axis of symmetry and now im covered in unreasonably hot cheese can i get a moment of silence
not raunak joining and then instantly leaving üíÄ
the cwru2025 isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t active
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already three people including me in the account and there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not really anything to do but if we need an extra person i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll let you know
So my spotify account was just hacked and it turns out that over the past couple of months thousands of users have had this issue. So if you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t checked spotify in a while or if you notice it doing things like playing music outside of your control, connecting to apps you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recognize or adding new playlists, log into your account page using incognito mode on a browser and reset your password, remove all connected apps, and then hit the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlog out on all devices√¢‚Ç¨ button @here
sorry for the ping it is important though
Why would you want to hack someone elses spotify tho
idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only premium but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see why someone would bother to hack a free account
is just extremely hard for me to imagine
Yeah that happened to me a year ago
i don't have premium so :D
*psst* ad blockers work on spotify as well
nothing > anything
Lucky for me I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have premium
i dont think im a myers (tho probs my fav slasher) and im not on a boat
I don't see anything wrong with that
also im lonely :sad:
I hope u didnt pay for it
cuz if you did u got scammed
howdy more like downy :sad:
ok so u dont believe we can classify certain behavioral patterns people portray as personality archetypes?
im just trying to have a discussion
so u dont believe in behavioral patterns
*hell, it probably was made for the same reason gpa and the sat was made, to keep jews and blacks out of college for a "scientific" reason*
do you not know about the history of the sat?
yea i didnt know abt the discriminatory nature of it
ig mbti can be a way to detect week points in you personality and work ok it
like telling zhanda he needs to shut
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already Saturday smh
Are you still in India?
Omg so early on a saturday....
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t slept
omg üòÇ
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that many late classes
Rip..
@jarvisthepooper don't you live in macau
idk :D
cuz meg excels at that
same as me wtf üò≠
can we get pronoun roles too? up to u guys idk
sorry newbies
Sorry to everyone who hops on and has to read all that
And they still going in introductions :sad:
but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sad realizing i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take it easy anymore
uhhhh i think across the country getting a 4.0 as a pre med is hard
doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get u into med school tho
since his brain power crushes everyone else int the class
rip my gpa this fall
gets you a degree tho
taken AP chem but i have no idea what to expect out of that class besides that it is tough
Can I get a rip here
neuro bs doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get a good job tho
you can still get a phd tho
lol same tho
imagine wanting to do more school after doing more school
couldnt b me
sorry to break to u howdy
but u will always have to study even after u graduate
The thought of school ending scares me.... what do I do afterwards?
no studying allowed
gotta find gay onlyfans
its 2021. we need to normalise this
normalize being able to live off of one job
bc u u do bad, its hard to come back from that
really?
idk tbh. the 80% includes those who took 1 or 2 gap years
or, if ur broke like me, you've already beeen doing one
also depending on like how hard ur field is and how much harder it gets as time goes on
its really hard for some people
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t anticipate having to work regularly to pay off tuition but it would be nice
i asked a FA officer about working to pay off tuition and he said those who work regularly only make about $2500 a year
so it wouldn't be enough
idk anyone who has but they always have winners so
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hurt tho i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure it takes a lot of time
I want that one
Yeah I made one last week
Damn I missed the deadline
Yeah idk
can you apply if you arent fonna like
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s another one that recognises artistic talent
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure that ended in December
i will cry myself to sleep now
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tho
I mean I took a gap year so
Ugh
the worse they can do is say no
looks like u dont want free money
Why would u do that to urself tho
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to maximise my chances here
so it seems like u got bunch of room to grow
even non music ppl can tell when something has gone terribly wrong
The conversation we had the other day about biomaterials was intriguing though
Pandemic fucked me up I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t access my instrument so I left a note saying the recordings were like a year old and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve improved lol
they dont know how much improvement
with nursing it's hard tho but im not discouraging you
Secondary is less work I assume
And it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that for the performance one üëÄ
worst they can do is say no
why apply for scholarships when you can simply steal money
yeah but :(( it already passed
plus i suck at cello heheh
God the ambiguity is killing me
Except for A
@chandachan rip man
RIP.... mentally accepting it already
omg genuine
but you didnt ban me did you?

i want elitist cs major role
We're gonna have this here now since we dont got #quotes

bye!!!!
a vacuum in my head
@megmcmuffin22 how do summer classes work? is there a credit limit?
which isnt true for like summer sem
and i mean when i took it it was online, so i also didnt have to consider costs of summer housing
you wouldnt want any of that COMMIE free college!?!?!?!
have you taken any summer classes ?
3 weeks
my class was held over 8 weeks
obviously when u have a class for longer ur gonna meet less times a week, my class had 3 allotted time slots per week but we usually only met for 2
like 5 weeks, 8 week, 4 weeks
yea close enough
in 5 mins?
lmao after my j term class being 4 hours a day i be sitting thru 2.5 hr lectures like its nothing
4 hours classes were hell
my class might as well have been 5 days a week bc we had labs to complete outside
im actually thinking of taking some math classes in the summer
since a lot of them have calc 2 as the prereq which im taking this sem
i feel like taking a bunch in the summer might be a lot
u also have to make sure the schedules dont conflict, which i feel like a lot of summer courses prob will
also the contestant who has been revealed to be racist is currently winning the show and I am just so tired
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so tired!
ok I had actually never heard of that before but I googled it and it looks fucking primo I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll add it to my list
it is a bit graphic tho so be warned
I will probably be able to manage it
sex and gore don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bother me it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s secondhand embarrassment that is most guaranteed to make me stop watching literally anything
its basically softcore porn tbh but that doesnt take away from how good it is
I love trash. I am such a big fan of terrible terrible trash
fuck
like drag race had the decency to cut absolutely any footage of their problematic contestant that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t plot-critical
and that show only takes itself like 75% seriously
(Except I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t...yet)
start with season 9 if you want something wholesome or with season 12 if you want your senses to be completely assaulted
actually idk if 12 is free on Amazon yet
might need purchasing
oh shit 9 is actually also purchase where did we even watch the last few seasons
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even WATCH season 11 we skipped 11 and 8
I'm taking my nightly boomer walk RN and if I don't put my hands back in my thicc gloves imma get frostbite
So bye?
The panorama I took is bad
Idk why but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s prolly why I wanna go into renewables
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t outsmartass the smartass
i wasnt talking about your panorama

@.bugcatcapoo can u make it so that the bot doesnt dm everytime i react
hey i can't react in roles :PingSock:

Oh
weird that it doesnt have the little plus sign thing but yeah
u didnt give perms for that
oh sorry yeah
i wasnt the one who set this channel up so i dont know the perms
ok u should be able to now
i fr am :Mad:
bro tried to yoink smh
ok moose looks like cooldown can't be changed but i can fix the dm thing so i'll do that in a sec
cooldown isn't too bad, its fine
also i realized the reason we didnt have add reactions enabled is bc then people could fuck with the rolemenu setup lolol
yea u dont need to have them enabled
dont' change it :harold:
yahya theres nothing you can do that we cant also figure out on our own
we dont need any new mods atm
dyno is around as useful as yag but the UI is worse
rip i c
aw I can't add new reactions in roles :angrysad::angrysad::angrysad:
so if we leave add reactions on then ppl like zhanda and raunak would be able to mess up the role emotes
yea but other emotes wont affect the role-creating emotes right
either way it's only for the laffs so its okay if you don't want to :harold:
fair :blobconga::blobconga::blobconga:
oh god damn it wait is it still dming even though i just turned that shit off

Just need something basic
Yea I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been looking at some of theirs but I see very mixed reviews. People either die for them or absolutely hate them
tbh for under 50, any of the more well known brands will leave u content
that way if you lose or break the usb connector, you can just get a new connector
Well, I have days where I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exactly√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ move. So I usually sit in bed and connect my set up to my tv so I can study and stuff from bed

It's their job to convince them to come now that you've been accepted
The days are over of you trying to convince them, now it's their turn to convince you üòÇ
pain
Bye!
bye bb
i feel scammed
i feel scammed
üòÉ  is this what it feels like to be emotionally maniupalive
fuck all pisces
ik you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re sad about getting older but you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to turn that into aggression
i still stand by what i said fuck all pisces
no one:
maggie: I hate 1/12 of the population indiscriminately
not even a pisces just sad for them
u wouldnt be sad for a pisces if you dated one üò©
u want my hemogoblin admit it
:(( we cant be friends
sorry babe
can't help it i'm a squirtle
thats fair
okay wtf i have not been playing batman
within 12 categories there must still be a decent amount of room for variation
so saying I had a bad experience with this small selection of pisces
therefor 8% of the population is universally bad
just seems like a big jump 2 me personally
my two best friends are scorpios but I hate them both terribly,
i dont fuck with scorpios
literally never spoken to a Scorpio
thats actually a fair questions
idk, i wonder what the men descriptions r like
thats fair thats fair
idk my cancer guy friend is practically a housewife
DHFSJZSFE okay okay lmao i never thought this deep with the zodiac descriptions i dont hate women i swear
sorry what was the last thinfg you said
anyway I barely fit the cancer description and I grew up feeling insulted by these things for no reason so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve thought abt them a lot
like idk it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just very stepford wife
LMAO okay you have a fair point ig i never thought of zodiac stuff like that
but that has nothing to do with my zodiac sign
i was like no miss please dont steal my bones
damn ishika okay i see you
dont laugh at my pain just because it was floppy and absurd
Sorry bb üòûüòû get well soon my guy
what the fuck
what the fuck
i wrote in my homework "the true proportion of teens who have been stupid"
because that's just not something I want to think about in AP statistics
also hey why is that in the textbook at all when it clearly has a response bias isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that against the whole thesis of the class
@kaori_flute go study
Wow I went to bed early didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I
you might b able to find it and slurp some questions from it
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that will be available till the summer though
rip
feel free to take whatever u want from it
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI am okay/sometimes okay/not okay with guests√¢‚Ç¨ was broken down in my mind as
It doesn't matter, bring a guest in your room with the wrong RA and they will :ban:  you
last year some people had their heart set on who their roommate is even when their roommate didn't commit yet, and it went badly
i mean i guess it didnt matter too much this year bc everyone was in a single anyway but
still
They are still often the first people you meet on campus tho, regardless
~~i forgot~~
when you want to find a roomate?
cuz u choose your room then
Nope üòÇ
did i miss anything?
@.fim. do you need me to apply the rash cream on you?
@chandachan @raunakwastaken you guys really need to stop spamming this server
they dont care about the dumb jokes
the issue isnt how it affects me
@pickle169 FYI: stay away from Finn, he walks very slowly and he is microaggressive ü§¢
aye is it sold out yet
Pain
it keeps happening to me its so damn annoying
We need to pick up ourself in here
won't he have apple-shaped bald spots when you rip the stickers off
Nah the sticker isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a tap
idk why am i in love with ur dog
Keeping the vets away I see
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen my dawgs for like a yearü•∫
OH
omg twinsies we both arent citizens :)))
ok jarvis i have never been to macau
My fam moved to Macau when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going elementary school
oh
It means ur mum is dead
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t intend to stay
So people who want to gamble head over to Macau because there are no regulations
Living here is really expensive tho
Idk in English
And in extremely poor neighbourhoods cage homes
I can swear in Portuguese tho
But other than that I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Damn
Damn
i got mine stolen once when I went to New York and fell asleep on a bench in Central Park
im so sad, atleast they left me the other one
NYU is wildin though
But if u are rich it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
not cheap cheap but still
or was it someone else
idk
Really
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a huge football fan tho
please leave nobel alone
OH NO BELL
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fucking with you
i cant tell if u rfucking with me when u say that
but genuinely never trust anything zhanda says esp if he accompanies it with a ping that means he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s trying to harass ppl
@chandachan leave your brother alone
Sorry
So zhanda is exchanged from a Australia college?
technically speaking they are also called universities here, a college is a smaller school within a university
Yea I did a research paper on history on American higher education development
it took two tries to get one that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t disappoint me
anyway the lesson here is to always question authority and never believe anything without getting proof first
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to take that
Why I feel sarcasm from zhanda
tbf tho anything dipped in batter and and fried is probably pretty edible
I actually think tempura zucchini is better than tempura shrimp but I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be arguing about that
why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they have a whole cucumber is it because it would look too much like a penis
evidently I have no cause for concern
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat raw carrot
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be the only person who, when a game has a party selection system, I just imagine all the unselected party members are inside my pockets
just hidden away on my person
I think this is because inactive party members literally always know everything that happened even if they weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there
i just assume that is because they are actually with me and just electing not to fight because they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re sleepy or something
My ignorance makes me feel confuse about wdym
its raining
@chandachan havent paid for nitro once
dont know why
we had to make a few basic ones for my AP Theory class last year
yo that is sick
i liearned some for virtual orchestra and i was like wtf

we did soooo many practices and i think i only got 2 correct
AHHAHAH god i felt that, and theres the contrpuntal movement or whatever that was idk it was so simple and i messed up i cant imagine doing wha tyou do
luckily i probably dont have to do any more till college
and i did ok on the AP last year
i was gonna take ap music theory but uh not enough people at our school wanted to take it to be a class
a little. since it was online they cut A LOT of the sections out so it ended up just being 2 part writing PDFs and two sightreads
though the part writing was HARD
im gonna cry
nah ive just finish the class
I took a gap year so that was all last year
GAP YEAR i wanna so i can save some money but
oh i did too
as long as you have some sort of plan for what youre gonna do they dont topically reject differ propositions

I hate to say it but it only gets worse lol
:c i am scared of student loans
so bad
I hate to repeat after nobel
Sorry üòî
and student loans can get pretty fucking bad if u cant pay them off quickly?? the interest is ridiculous and is what puts a lot of people in very bad debt
after loans its almost the same price as my instate school but its still a lot
As Abba says: If I got me a wealthy man I wouldn't have to work at all
I fucking wish
it feels like the middle/upper middle gets the least in scholarships
bc the rich can actually pay for college
and the people who acutally needs aid most times when they do get aid its a a lot and for good reason im not complaining
but middle class gets nothing
so fml
fr fr they dont
fuck texas anyways
dont even
UH i cant
OH üíÄ

oh god I was so distracted by the cilantro conversation that I forgot what was going on in my dragon age game and accidentally blew 50 silvers on a sex worker because I thought I was running a quest
all my companions are so disappointed with me now
Clinantro is great, not our fault you rolled bad taste buds
idk about clinantro that shit might be good I never tried it
Spelling hard
not feeling the love
@Deleted User we broke up on pictochat crying on my DS
throwback to my bioethics final presentation last semester
pretty much any other teacher we wouldve failed with this powerpoint but this class is taught by one of the theology teachers who is a knocked off old man who spends all of the classes talking about personal anecdotes from his youth and never actually succeeds in teaching us anything
meanwhile my school is the fucking MIT of our area where every student hates themself for not being smarter than their friends
and the smart kids hate themselves for being smart
there isn't any at my school
it's basically just work
only work
my school is the "i only got 83rd percentile on the psat im so much dumber than all my friends" school
there is a group of kids at my school don't give a shit and thats who I hang out with
doesn't give a shit about school or what other people think of him, he just does what he loves
Meanwhile my school is nothing but artist (ofc, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a digital art school) and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the funding for ap classes üíñ
she never swipes right on anyone
yeah we don't have a ton of AP classes compared to the public schools around us but they're like the core essentials
(except the calc ones because we offer AB and BC)
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t met many of them yet
well i guess you can take ab junior year then bc senior but then you have to do b twice
yeah my school you take a test for calc and u get into either ab or bc
our school cut music theory bc not enough ppl were taking it
i bombed my tests and in class assignments but then got a 4 somehow
like I had a solid C- in that class most of the year
some ppl grew up in such a pressure cooker that when they get to college they dont know how to not pressure cook themselves and each other :cri:
from what i can tell tho case isnt like that
ree didn't reply
she's pressure cooking herself by trying to like triple major or some bullshit
oh goodie
You won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get to meet the gunner pre meds because they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be too busy studying to interact with anyone :uniqua:
oh no, my 4.0 went to a 3.99
very very annoying
my friends will say they got bad grades and when Im like "lmao same I got a C- on the last test" theyre like "oh i got a B" and im like damn i clowned myself
Oh I got a bad grade " 92.4" is very common here
and she wants to finish in four years
my test avg in chem last year was 43
i don't think she burns out
well tbf she has never done 3 college level programs at the same time
we have a new principal this year who is trying to turn us into an ivy factory and he has no respect for us and all the seniors have been harassing him trying to get him to stop being such an asshole
my school fr
Cleveland state, cwru, and cuyahoga community college
glad to be leaving this year bc it's going down the drain but my brother just joined the school so üôÉ
This is my school
hopefully he'll be able to make it through with a principal who DOESNT EVEN BOTHER TO CC THE STUDENTS ON EMAILS TALKING ABOUT CHANGES IN THEIR CLASS SCHEDULES
like they dont believe in
We have √¢‚Ç¨≈ìfire Friday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s√¢‚Ç¨ and my recording principals teacher just stands there and bobs his head to musics
oh my god our old head of the upper school went on a talk show as a teenager doing bird calls and my friend and i found it and sent it around
this is so sad
Rip
And some dude stuck a gum on the camera in classroom
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really see the point in hybrid learning√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ especially while cases are rising in most areas
My school only has 200 students
Including middle school
EVERYONE the episode is june 2 1978 featuring the piedmont high school bird callers if anyone can find it PLEASE send it to me im so upset
OH IT'S ON AMAZON PRIME
My brother goes to a special Ed school and they have been back for a while (like 3 students per class) and they had like 8 cases in the first month ü§°
We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any cases for now
Idk y
all of the cases at my k-12 school have been either middle school kids or faculty
i've been here since early december lol

howdy i dont understand this particular implementation of moneybags

Then realized I actually could
im so bored
Hi so bored
I think I need to go and get some milk from the store first
maybe at some point once I am NO LONGER FAILING ENGLISH :blurryeyes: :blurryeyes: :blurryeyes: :blurryeyes: :blurryeyes:
Online school is so terrible. You are either getting a 100% on a class or failing/barely passing. I cried about getting a 65% on my first calc exam and found out that I have one of the highest grades with the lowest grade being a 24%
OKAY literally online school is so fucking weird bc
but Annie fuck eng you right
me too if its online i will fail
which is so unfortunate because I had some spectacularly bad takes that no one outside of my class would understand
Ugh I have to literally do my Math internal assessment for IB, correct my extended essay, and prepare for the Spanish oral and tok presentation! Yay
My math IA was such a joke i almost failed it (literally) it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why my final grade got dragged to a 5 even tho I consistently got 7s
Yeah it is a self study for me cause of AP calc BC
I hate how we have to do this extended essay
@ishikak892 go to sleep it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s school night
Every time I see you up you always have an essay dueüòÇ
guess who can now be legally drafted?

blinn cheap asf tho
like i shit on them but ppl doing blinn team rlly do be finessing the system
dunno if y'all get these emails yet
no id rather go to school srry
i do think that online attendance should be provided as an option for students as we go back on campus, esp in big lectures where in-person attendance doesnt make that much of a difference in the actual experience because you arent actively participating and youre basically just sitting and listening to someone talk for an hour
some professors record their lectures anyway if they dont care but if professors dont record its to encourage attendance, bc thats ur responsibility
and i get it if covid is still a concern then i think its very valid
tbh, my math would b the same if chris was projecting on the screen vs writing on the whiteboard
I guess for some classes it may work
my anatomy class did
the lectures as of rn u can choose whether u want to go in person or not
so days when u feels like it, you go, and when you dont, you watch online
when ur working, u cant just
not feel like going
I hope we can meet people without being so worried
europe gets personal days, why cant we
u dont get unlimited personal days
i hate life
our bio lab presentation was graded too harshly, so now im stressed over a dumb 1-credit class. i spilled coffee on my laptop today and kindve on my ipad but i saved them so we gucci. and idk why i have to take a programming class for my major smh
im so sorry
it's ok. others have it worse than me and my laptop is fine. i can still get an A in bio lab but i gotta be super conscious of our work. may just ask around for help on my programming labs
FYI: Priyanka's CV is longer than a tax return form
Awwww it will be ok
not me cranking out 1,500 of the worst most poorly cobbled together words over the course of multiple hours for a creative writing assignment that was supposed to be due a week ago
not this assignment that is 500 words longer than the minimum limit still being literally the worst piece of fiction i have possibly ever written
not me being tempted to delete it out of shame instead of handing it in
couldnt be me, im a good and responsible student who would not rather fail a class than risk moderately embarrassing myself, that is why i am passing english currently
RIP even I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine how tuff creative writing in case

@yyxto med school or undergrad
For my school it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s harder to get into similar ranked schools than UCs
But I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to any UCs tho
Idk why tho
No clue on med school
But UCs isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t popular in my school so I may have too few cases to compare
same most of us wanna stay in-state but i wanted to leave
yea and my hs generally want to stay on the west coast
at minimum i wanted to leave my hometown
Technically as an international students I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m far away from home lmao
But I still didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t applying schools near D.C. cuz I wanna discover other places
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply UCs cuz I want private more public
Some ppl in my hs just wanna go somewhere far away from their famüòÇ

IB Exams got cancelled üòÅüòÅüòÅ

Eat shit and die
we still have them here üò¶ :blobheadache:
i'm at my aunt's house in florida and she has a newfoundland dog
i can never escape ffs
oh
wrong meg lmao
i forgot :pablo: :pablo: to fall asleep :tasha:
im really struggling with this adjective
But hey board exams are cancelled at our school
So we just need the IAs for the diploma
we still have exams üò©
Ugh that sucks! Maybe it may get cancelled in the end
i don't think it will, they are reduced tho, only paper 1 and 2
Math and science content not reduced tho üôÉ
they aren't doing paper 3
cry
ich bin dumb as fuck
but i rarely see them so i dont have remotely a broad enough vocabulary or understanding of how to pronounce things to even approach actually speaking it
and ice cream is sladoled but that one feels slavic enough to probably be slovene
my brother will sometimes say "oh shit. ive gefallen"
Don't ask me anything tho, because ich weiss nichts
Bruh no I just got back from a class
Oh bruh
Can't; I have class at 4pm
i wanna get vaccinated ugh
there are young college students getting vaccinated and im like how ??
like these people are non-prospective healthcare people tho
Couldn't be Case
When I find Spanish hard üôÉ
I volunteered last week but it wasn't at the end
English and German are already very similar
i miss middle school priyanka
I don't think that is an adequate measure of difficulty of languages lol
i didn't think french was hard tho
tho, i am forgetting much of french since it's been 2 years since i've taken it
at least i haven't forgotten hindi
The grammar in German is worse than that in French
i wish i didn't stop practicing french
i still speak hindi but FRENCH
It's Indo-European so there's probably some things that are congruous to English
ehhhh idk about that tbh there are some english words incorporated into the hindi language
although,' bus' also means 'enough'
Nope
English: I want some coffee and whipped cream
My speaking is bad. üòÇ
i cant tell what american ppl r saying in american opera
german is basically just structured like archaic English grammatically too. like English without the bad parts
whereas mandarin and cantonese are both full of a lot of sounds that aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t found in English or Spanish at all and the romanization is the reason no one who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t speak chinese can ever pronounce it at all
OH SHIT I FORGOT MY PP PUPU
no i havent checked this server in some time
idk who you are
tho tbf like 80% of the conjugation that is taught in Spanish education is straight up never used in actual spoken Spanish I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know why they prioritize that over actually teaching you how to speak the goddamned language
I think mostly Spanish is harder than German because the way it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s taught is like straight up broken
went into the public school system fluent and after 5 years of Spanish classes I came out not speaking the language at all anymore :cursed_flushed:
*PE* oh goodness
pointless exercise, worst class
yeah we just sit there doing push-ups for an hour it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrible
I hate online PE
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally me everyday tho
i am simply trying to be √¢¬≠ less underweight √¢¬≠
I like to do it when I am not forced to and ugh PE forces us to do writing assignments online
why do u need to write for pe
sax is a really nice instrument but to be fair people who play the saxophone are universally shitlords
never met a sax player who didnt wear sunglasses indoors and make weed jokes in math class
it was good for me bc i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to play that much in marching band since they covered for me
theyre the people who wear santa hats on the last day before winter break
flute√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard too tho so if you quit bc you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it i feel you
i actually quit bc in high school band meets in the morning before class and i didnt want to wake up early
but apparently never seeing even seeing the sun out the window is bad for your mental and physical wellbeing
the sun doesnt exist most of the year here
i used to play saxophone though but gave up after careless whisper became boring
flute seems hard, mad respect for people that can play it
im classically trained on violin but have gone all over the place with other instruments
he was in the carolina chocolate drops and then left because he didn't want to play just one kind of music
missed the convo but wow we should form a full orchestra
what is wrong w full symph
maybe if the composition sucks :c you dont enjoy symphony no 9??
pain
i mean it gets muddy if the orchestra plays badly or the composer sucks shit
a lot of modern full-orchestra music is pretty terrible and pretentious and more focused on doing weird shit with math and time signatures than on sounding good or being interesting
but traditional orchestral pieces are really good, and i think a lot of music originally written for a full symphony lose a lot of their impact when theyre performed in chamber compositions instead
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to know
some people still use wooden flute
omg such TASTE
i love the moldau ive played it like 2 times lmao also shosty is so fun even tho it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s supposed to represent the stalinist era,,
what kind of violin pieces did u play tho?
it's actually an insanely valuable skill to be able to look at a score and be able to play two violin parts at once
meanwhile I went through an organ phase
it goes so hard i played almost all the mvmts
sibelius sounds so hard i could never
Just 1st movement tho
nah i don't really perform
hoping that will change in college though because i've started re-learning arrangement after spending the last four years learning to actually write down my musical ideas
this is what happens when you're a musician who doesn't talk to girls or go outside for the entirety of high school
if you don't play the sitar don't @ me /s
it's really friggin hard
stupid microtonality
it isn't?
not even true i literally attended class earlier today
Terrible acoustics tho
they do some crazy shit
one of my friends from dallas went to elementary school with jd beck I think
it was either kindergarden or elementary school
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t committed yet but case is one of my very top choices
just curious but why aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there more channels on the server for stuff
idk anyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s circumstances so i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know whether or not anyone is lying
the server used to be big w a lot of stuff but apparently a bunch of random ppl were joining so it was abandoned and this one was made, it hasnt really been expanded tho bc its still on the smaller side
ive seen on other servers that they have more channels so i was wondering why this one was so small
some arent
*i wish*
im moving into a townhouse next yr but im in an apartment rn
geese are annoying
except for the goose from untitled goose game
Who spent the entire first year in his room
well i hope my freshman year doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t turn out the same way
i want an emoji of him to use
fair
i'm also going to need space to get all my music shit together
yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really be able to practice in the dorm but being elsewhere would be easier for music in general
zacc is used to being the quirky one he feels threatened
my spotify wrapped thing crashed because it couldn't figure out what genre one of the bands was
wtf is australian reggae fusion
australian psych is when someone from down under tells you that it says gullible on the ceiling
and I looked up edmonton indie because i wanted to know what band it was
and couldn't find any results
no that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s australian death metal
idk
i don't think he is
I just googled it he lives in a completely different province what the fuck
that we just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about because we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re
god I hate sapphos
theyre usually pretty strict about it, i only got out of it bc of covid but i dont think that will be an option for u guys. i think u can also get out of it if u have a medical need that cant be accomodated thru university housing
sorry if someone answered that already
Istg I need an orientation week
giant steps on guitar is hard
but also really fucking hard
i learned the head and the chords
oh you mean transcribing nvm
that's more like 26/16 due to the subdivisions
homie just straight up changes key every few notes to mess with poor tommy flanagan
poor guy
being able to pull that off just on the spot? absolutely insane
I think they recently released a ton of giant steps alt takes as well, but I haven't looked at those yet
anyone dare take jenin away as my tour guide can fight me
She just doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna say it publicly
sorry, but i showed up to campus first
Aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you an OL tho

OMG BOB
the way that picture instantly reminds me of the many emails i got last year
@kaori_flute some people can't get enough of the metal ü•µ
iirc it was the 17th last year
uhhh i haven't heard anything about cwru decisions coming out

trying to figure out if i need to upgrade my rfid implant
https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/ if anyone wants one
gonna have to read my friends card when she gets home because the datasheet for the door didn't help
Nope!! Too scared to üòÇ
I hate shots and needles too in general
(not that dudes don't get piercings, they're just the only people that talk about it that way)
I probably shouldn't tell you about the ones that you need to slice a slot into your hand for either huh
but they cut a slot where you want it installed
it doesnt matter whether it's a rfid stamp or a bommer key chain
i will still lose it
dont lose this one
cuz its not cheap to replace if you lose ur case id
Finn once said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou can watch aot without being a weeb√¢‚Ç¨
gonna have to reread the last few dozen tho once the final chapter comes out
cause its easy to lose track of the details when u only read once a month
oh def i need to do that too
i binge read like the last 30 chapters of the manga last week bc i finished the anime so far so i prob missed a lot
pls keep your micro-aggressiveness away from this server
stop being so fucking microaggressive finn
i dont think a direct threat of violence counts as a microaggression anymore zhanda
Finn do be aggro tho
abd then I tried to go back to my other joke and now u guys are like no we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still on this first joke. you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand this first joke that you jokes
I tried to go back to my second joke
you said "knock knock," i said "hey that's a thing that you do on a door!" and then I said "the capitalists don't want you to know about outcorporation" and then you guys said "you dont udnerstand knock knock jokes" and then i said "youre focusing on that instead of joining my conspiracy theory" and then you said "annie respond to the knock knock joke"
tl;dr I did a thing where i responded to a joke by pointing out the obvious and then I said a different joke. u guys pointed out that i missed the original joke and i deflected by saying you arent paying attention to my joke, and in response to trying to move on i was once again told i didnt undertsand the joke
are trying to censor the knowledge
Bruh your tl;dr needs a tl;dr
me just trying to move on from the joke i missed by making a new joke
meanwhile everyone else is like annie didnt understand joke
fuck off
short
not in this tiny empty comedy box everyone is trying to keep me in
im trying to grow but u guys keep going "hur dur missed the joke"
im bad at joke
i have a really hard time talking in short sentences
im sorry
and u guys thought i missed the joke because i responded to a joke with another joke that didnt land it's pretty sad
im literlaly not even upset but i feel like im coming across as upset
and once again it isnt landing
guys it's like we're stuck in hell
will a hug get me out of hell @chandachan
will it end our collective suffering
u kno they can talk for hours about nothing
damn i wish i was a valley girl
i mean i felt bad for you. youre writing so much and no one is gonna read it
oh wow i did not fail my first paper
and wrote college essays
i guess thats the problem of being in a test optional year
soul wasnt crushed enough
sad
she talks a lot tho
oh god im doing it again
i cant stop
sorry
sometimes ppl read messages bc they get notification anxiety it doesnt mean theyre interested in you
raunak u cant prove a negative
don't be shy!
raunak stop harassing people or youre never going to have any friends üòî
epic fail
another sad attempt
i don't watch anime
@.bugcatcapoo is our favourite class of '25 student!
Finn stop asian hate
@united_cheetah_50453 Why do you hate Asians
I got nothing not even my acceptance letter in paper
i got like a drawstrong back with a bunch of like keychains and shit
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember receiving a physical acceptance letter but I could be wrong
Cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m living with one of my frd in my class and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s getting acceptance from different colleges in mail
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t receive anything except bobs email
Colleges mailed me acceptance packages that included the letter but case was one of the few that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t include a letter
You should. Even my class got one
Cuz I got nothing
@chandachan if bob determines that my midterm gpa hasnt increased enough from last semester to maintain enrollment can u tell him that im ur backyard friend
theres like a 3% chance that bob requests my midterm transcript and if that happens there's like a 5% chance that he says "sorry u didnt meet the terms of your enrollment go fuck yourself worm"
~~don't trust me tho im a loser~~
dont gaslight me jenin that's messed up
mhm idk tbh
go 2 sleep then smh
ur not the one out of the two of us with 4 more math assignments to do before noon
well
i won't specify numbers
but i have math lectures, physics hw and sages essay outline to do
damn
we do b crying
hell yeah let's cry :D
i just spent 6 straight hours doing calc my finger hurty
i just spent 6 hours doing nth
we're group studying
alright ive stretched long enough i have more homework to do
distance learning really did make me depressed enough to stop doing homework for 2 months straight
but its ok im a fucking GENIUS and my brain has MILES OF SURFACE AREA distributed across its wrinkles so i will probably not fail... more than. more than one class
ill probably only just fail the 1 :blurryeyes:
nah u won't fail
i mean by every other school's standards i will not fail
just don't pay attention to this and do work :)
but at my school below a 70% in a class is technically a fail?
work
but failing by the stupid standards that my GARBAGE SCHOOL has
ur school could be worse isokk
does it get really really wonky and complicated
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into theoretical stuff unless you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing smth weird and interdisciplinary
bc generally with bme ur not gonna need to know what a quark is or what strings are
@nobelium19 I went to sleep before you last night
It depends on if one is doing the biomechanics discipline. I guess for biomaterials we don't
like a bme working in something other than bme is rare
an ME working in BME isn't
still cool though
So I feel if I have knowledge of different areas of engineering, it will be useful.
ok, what is healthcare management? because I think hospital admin but I also do not think that is right.
that is pretty sick
I want to hear about this now lol
The surgeon I shadowed in hs let me like work one of the robotic surgical machines during a procedure
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything to the patient obviously
I just moved the camera back and forth once
Oh
can't type lol
You were inside the patient?
it uses eye tracking and just follows where you look without having to use a joystick or hand controls
i'm completely desensitized to human stuff from working there
And on the outside it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look gross at all
It just looks like a few instruments are inside a patient
depends on how strong your stomach is
Well in my case it was a gallbladder removal surgery so it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like seeing blood
I remember when I broke my wrist
My dad broke his arm and has metal plates inserted
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know?
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember you telling us you broke your wrist
Maybe you did and I forgot
ouch
hopefully this one will last me 7 years like the last one
i don't fuck with e-waste
iphone 12
my last one was an iphone 6
it should last longer methinks
has it really been 7 years since the iPhone 6?
It tells me that service is required
üçé needs more of my money
it was at 94% 6 months ago tho :thonk:
i've had my phone for 2.5 years now i think
idk
@raunakwastaken i wish my memory worked well in academics

Priyanka do you remember when I got my last haircut?

mine used to be just under $73k
idk
ope idk
Without aid
i havent gotten an update coa yet so i cant come in with input on what engr is like
STILL??
damn
I never got an email and the cost looks the same for me
Yeah I never got an update I am so confused
I got merit aid and never got a notification
seems like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m the only one that got it
case does it when they feel like, dw theres nothing more scary than getting an email saying, "Based on recent information, your fin aid has been altered" at like 2am
and u can't get used ones cuz there is a code or sth u need from the books
make sure u remember that, not spend more money and lose that allowance :D
*bookstore bucks aint case cash*
cuz it's there
sorry what?
why cant ?? huhwhats in the bundle??
i personally don't know sorry :/
i don't do well so i never looked into that :')
oh do they mess with your fin aid based on outside scholarships
dunno about federal
yeah idk about case when it comes to that tbh
wow good thing i didnt win any outside scholarships ü§°
dunno :D
or don't report ;)
And there's no way to circumvent this because if you don't report the outside scholarship on their questionnaire, you still have to send the scholarship to the financial aid office
College is expensive üôÉ
outside scholarships won't affect your merit aid, but could impact your federal aid
nope
Oh so should I apply for scholarships outside too then?
oh fs
Yeah, they don't deduct too much from the federal grant
the rd to come out cuz thats when you hear back about some scholarships
@everyone Go get your headshots taken by Max for 100 dollars
my friend has an iphone 6 se

I J WANT SOCKS AND A SHIRT

I got into lehigh somehow even though I withdrew my application but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m waiting to turn them down until I get my acceptance package
And a few other things I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember

I'm 21 and a half
It's bad

üò≠  crying myself to sleep
This is a pretty bad move to say to an RA
OH
ive never had alcohol in my life
We'd hate to see you be *rescinded*
once i was at thanksgiving with my family and my cousin came up to me with a brown liquid and said here drink this and i took a sip and it tasted like nail polish remover and i wanted to throw up

Oh
Then you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have Drew

We are scared for that class üòÇ
i watched several mins of that anime and it scared me
ADBSFUHEIOJASDJSVBHUEHD ok fair ill admit the dream stuff is rly freaky
i get scared too easily so that is not an option
fair fair
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no official or right one, but the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcwru2025√¢‚Ç¨ one doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to be active
theyre limited to 3 ppl + the guide tho
omg
how does that work
you sit on an erg (rowing machine) it is plugged into a computer and through the power of the internet you race people
air rowing
Air rowing is a core exercise that we do sometimes
there is a livestream if you really wanted to see what it looks like
@_zacc How much do u think would be left over to pay w/ scholarship?
i mean idk, i'm not a financial advisor
You got half tuition off
^thats not including other expenses like housing and meal plans though
@evryone my feet are cold
How you doing @1800meggo? Committed or still considering?

Ok rob sorry we cant all be you
https://www.facebook.com/PurnotaFoundation (sorry if links lot allowed)
considering my rejection streak it aint work out
my bad Gen**
ah crap
GO TO SLEEP
I sit in my room and cry ab anime
I had no friends after moving to a new country (big surprise) so I ran and built insta accounts
i was so introverted in elementary and middle school I taught myself how to be an engineer and was designing surgical robot hardware as a sophomore in hs. think about all the time people spend socializing, i spent all of it learning EE/ME/design tools
that's dope honestly. I was always into this sort of thing but never really got around to it
yeah, the secret is getting bad grades and spending all your time doing crazy stuff
I actually left the social media stuff a long time ago so I can focus on the social work sorta thing
like I got really into rocket propulsion last summer (and still am) so I built a rocket engine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRwU7fVsK0E
Flex competition im leaving
Man, I'd die to have muscial abilities
~~i can flex about my musical career too if you want~~
my main mentor/guru has a grammy and we just vibe, i've been producing bands since i was like 12, and i'm on spotify
Btw Meg, apparently nursing is pretty neat here afaik so hoping you attend! I'm near certain I'll commit here
RIP link
Man im still confused if i got in for data sci and analytics or comp sci üòõ the letter/portal didn't really mention. Should I assume first choice?
Really it didnt say??
Slight chance I'm going blind but idk I dont think so, did yours?
Sorry i swear i can ttpe im j using my tony iphone 6 rn
Im so mf stupid
IDK i thought it was pre med track, basically what you study before med school lmfao
like fuck the ivys and GT and the other top engineering schools, they're just so competitive
it seems like at case people aren't trying to beat everyone else, but genuinely trying to learn
I like the vibe at case, seems less cut throat
not yet
1 more school to get decision from
I *could* find out
it's someone on this server I know
I'm waiting on UW-Madison but probably gonna come here anyways because can't afford that gg
we have nursing school
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve heard they are hard to get tho
my college tracking notion sorted by final hear back date has a disturbing trend
idk how i got into all the schools I did considering how bad my gpa is
I got a fat reject from so many schools and waitlisted at a couple of good ones
I think the stuff I do outside of school does it
our gpa system is broken
Yeah I was wondering why there wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a major
I got Emory and umich but idk if I have any chance lol
the rest of us don't
yesss as long as he keeps his job!
Oh that sucks. Case is pretty good for financial aid
like 10.5k a year but gonna see if I can get it down to 8.5 ish because covid really hit the income hard
Seem
same except I'm not in any other disc or chat's the fb groups seem kinda bland.
or she was in mexico I forgot ngl
do we declare end of freshmen year or how does it work. Sorry if it seems a bit ignorant ü§ì
not ignorant at all dw. you declare by the end of freshman year i believe (someone fact check me cuz i heard from someone else that it was soph year)
its end of sophmore yr
but the deadline is end of sophmore yr
Oh dope someone from the warm side of the us
if any of you were wondering what weather is like in the southwest both of these videos were filmed in the middle of winter
Terrible
choosing schools which is obvious in itself ig... still waiting to hear back from a couple in April (which is so late !!) this year is driving me nuts
it's supposed to be invite-only.
i try to remove invite links after 24 hours (or a week on the groupme) but sometimes i fail to catch them because i dont actually check that often
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a groupme but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a link to it
Got it! I think I found it on the class of 2025 fb page!
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/canon/2521C002/10269346 anyone want a bare canon image sensor?

isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it illegal to record someone without their consent
or at least without them knowing
i mean i wasnt mad it was like my friend lmfao
Zoom isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the best with audio quality
i literally do not pay attention to any of my classes anymore and i feel awful about it
my professors also arent great at lecturing bc one always goes on irrelevant tangents and the other talks in the most monotone and disinterested voice ever
nothing
isnt the cia bs anyway
"I have nothing to hide, so privacy doesnt matter" is not a good arguement
Yep it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t- data is actually a tad scary
Seems like a growing major count me in
Ik ik, but actually what tho, undeclared? Or private sorta thing
howdy literally is a 40 year old man

I assumed he was 18 and they wanted 17yrs for some reason
i'm just here cuz of aa, not much else to it
I was gonna probably take a gap year if I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into case
Not because I wanted case that badly, just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really want to stay in state
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so fucking stupid wow
i didnt tho
or president or something idk
Ie I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have gone there rather than reapplying

Anyone here know a bit about the halal/kosher meal plan? Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find much info on it other than the fact it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s prepped off site üòõ
Ah shit should use the questions tab
food is crap for first years, I'm gonna be blunt
More expensive than the 17 a week one apparently. But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually dietary restriction so yehh
theyre trying to yea
i never went to fribley except for when i visited like 2 or 3 years ago
i don't know about the den and kosher stuff
i used mine on melt
ohhh i forgot about melt
i stopped eating 3 meals a day like 3 days into the semester
oh
i never went there
not the bagged potato chips either
also, if you need to buy anything, there's a campus ride to walmart and target
From what I can tell- not really a cut throat sort of environment here from the looks of it. How is the environment you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say ie the students and what not
go to as many events during discover week as possible
we don't have much of a social scene but
go to the club fair
i forgot that existed
nope
not really
if you wanna drink, you have to find connections. but other than that, drinking culture isn't huge here
i didn't cuz i don't vibe w greek life
i would recommend rushing a frat tho, every friend i have has recommended it
But I feel i may fit into the more professional sorta ones
probably STAT312, if you need to take it
all you need to know is that stonks can only go up

Fuck.

we had dorm problems BEFORE we arrived
1. 3rd floor bug net thing that goes over window fell out. we had to pull it up using my headphones
2. 1st floor water pipe burst, didn't get fixed for like 2 weeks, so we just had a trash bucket sitting there collecting water
3. Cockroach problems
4. A toilet on 3rd floor is constantly plugged. We couldn't fix it all year
but yea, the dorms here arent anything special till you hit junior yr
I hate roaches
Pain
they got my age wrong or something idk
god knows how old I'm it's complicated but yeah cockroaches suck
toilet issues dont seem to go well with your name gg

the rich get richer and poor get poorer feelsbadman
*stares in $500 laptop that my mom didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want me to get because she thought that was a lot of money* :uniqua:
shit- literally
my mom wouldn't let me spend more than $700 on a laptop
My mom wanted me to spend around $300 ü©¥
get your discounted laptop :D
gamer √¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏ laptop
laptops dont need to have a short lifespan
then died instantly
my thinkpad from 1998 is still running
my older laptop was 11 years old
the reason i did not use it for longer was bcz it fell of and split (not literally) into 2
aslong as they arent like ultrawides or something
would go for that if I went for PC but gonna shoot for laptop + 1 external
I was thinking of bringing my pc and laptop :D
I'm just using my laptop for collegr
genders scare me, don't wanna insensitive to what people identify as üòõ
Unfortunately, not in past few years. I got into live productions so into that. Got the setup because I had a marketing and management gig

so my mom really want me to go
near dc
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t associate with the √¢≈ì¬®rednecks √¢≈ì¬®
i miss ny
bro i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even see redneck flags in virginia what the fuck
When we went to Costco üòî
cleveland area is not super rednecky but i think once u start getting a little farther away from the greater cle region is gets more
and by little farther away, we mean bout 20min away
well guess what you wont like
maybe case isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t for me üôè
bye
I was ab to play a game then I remembered I said I can work Monday mornings ü§¢
this is why i only work friday evenings
become prn the hour req is literally nothing
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not staying over the summer so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find a point
and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like failing at things
thats literally nothing u could just do that and go home for the summer
Oh for realsies?
yea my friends who work in the j building have a 60 hr per year requirement
isnt that the terrible "reality" tv show tho
My boss said to text her if I wanted to return to work fall semester which is definitely not happening, I will be getting a Real Job
i work at a chick-fil-a
mine is 48 hrs every 6 weeks so dont work on my floor
i think over the summer im gonna work nights
idk man they hate me bc i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gay
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually a vegetarian so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even eat the food at work
i mean isnt it tho
chicken is bussin tho

Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had one b4
only worse
Oh we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been thru my choco opinions enough to establish I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat that anyway
smh my head ron
Sorry man
It was good shit
Crimes like jaywalking, being without a parent after 11pm
thats punishable by death
Cant have da cooties before marriage
wtf do yall call them
i got my permit at 15 and a half
meg said it aint
damn
its weird its just like being able to get ur license early if u take drivers ed but u need to have a restricted license first
curfew, only being able to have fam member passengers, not being able to drive on specific parkways/highways
really??
I mean I think ours was with a permit you had to drive with an adult with a license for a few months then you get the real boy license
we just do drivers ed √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù> permit for 9 months √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù> license
except for the highways thing
that must b cuz y'all dont got any farms in ur state
all my homies hate federalism ü•∂üòàüí™üèºüôè
permit is like after the written test, can only drive w parents or an approved instructor
why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we all just have one (1) government
Once I got my license that shit was over I was a free man
guess who it was
Dmv sucks regardless tho, wish I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve skipped that part
i went at 7am to avoid the line but it was still like out the door
oh shit i need to get a real id
not a bad idea
she dont
idk i assumed that that fact wouldve come up in our conversation about licenses
who needs a real id if you're too broke to fly
Honestly you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need one if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fly much
Probably still a silly reason tho
should i study the summary session si packet tomorrow morning or now
Ur already awake
my class aint until 1030 doe
thats p early if u think about it
I was going to text my boss that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going to be at work tomorrow but then i saw how I called in sick the last 2 weeks üòî
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just go in sleepy
if you normally have an 7am class, that kinda can b rounded to 8, and then that 8 is sorta close to 8:30, and then that 8:30, probs just can go to 9, and when u including getting ready thats already 10ish and then bam 10:30
I took 7am clinical next semester and regardless I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t regret it Bc I refuse to do 2-10pm
wtf
i feel like that was our option
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather wake up at 5:30 n chug caffeine than leave at 10pm
(ppl dont leave at 10pm)
just like how no sane instructor keeps us until 3
Oh mayb, our clinicals are pretty short rn so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m used to them using up all the time
ya 4 hrs is nothing
We usually end up chilling for the last hour Bc everything√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s done already
I miss Me√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢Chelle, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably always miss her no matter who I get in the future
The chat was quite interesting after I left√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù missed it!

*they just dont inforce it well*

someone said bring one of those things that like holds ur door closed
zeta psi gone doe
The members are still here though

cant tell me im wrong tho
BYE WES

wrong zach
zach is fiji really bad? i spoke to someone and he said they only had a rep bc of like drug use

theta chi has none tho
wtf is beta
crying
However, people literally fucking die at frat hazing at other colleges
still calling your frat beta in the year of our lord 2021
Someone at Bowling Green was hazed and died a few weeks ago if I recall correctly
Yep he died
Somebody at Penn State died
Somebody at Ohio state died
if it helps cailee literally every college has sex crime problems. the fact that case students are vocal about it is actually a very positive sign
oh?
dont be fooled its not only frats tho!!! sororities have issues too
Somebody at Yale died but she committed suicide
I've come to understand that most of the shitty things men do they don't do because they have malicious intent but because we're actual brainlets a lot of the time
Hence why I never rushed:ohgod: :ohgod: :ohgod:
yeah im like genuinely nervous about sexual misconduct tho
thats kinda awful isnt it
doesn't make it right
i didnt rush not bc of the issues but bc i couldnt see myself paying to talk to ppl ü§°
idk man i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like being powerless when that shit happens to me or anyone around me
If it helps, I've legitimately caught and stopped sex crimes before
and i hurt men
i've been able to diffuse some things before at my hs
I mean same though meg but also I heard that minorities don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the best experiences in sororities so√¢≈ì¬®
I actually wield some authority so I can swing my hammer if need be
i know but its still scary :(
ITS STILL BAD THO

This is what they're talking about regarding the intolerant left
California needs that water folks
deez nuts is terrible for the environment
So much for the tolerant left

i can throw myself down a cliff on skis though does that count?
i started skiing when I was 3, my dad really likes skiing
I wish I could have done it this year
and last one
i have issues though, because i'm on so much anti-anxiety medication that i have no subconscious sense of self preservation
so all the decisions I make on the mountain to not die are completely consious
well if you haven't gotten injured yet you must already be pretty good
not "seriously" injured, I've split helmets in half fucking up flips
don't mess with concussions kids
oh damn
somehow i've never broken a bone though
sprained my wrist on a mountain bike though
which is annoying because it was on the ride back to the house after doing a really dangerous trail
yea I broke my wrist on a mountain bike, damn trees

i feel like i should kick you for this
i just took them away
dude i had to use light mode for 1 month cause i lost odds
worst month of my life
Folks, how bad are Cleveland winters?
from what i understand it doesnt get significantly colder than other midwest areas, but the problem is that the wind off the river is coming down from canada and it's freezing
How bad it is depends on where you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re from
also get winter shoes with good traction so you dont slip on the ice and die
Ya don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t die
also get some FAT socks
Make me an admin, I do nothing and have notifs on for this server

Ya my brain broke
dear members, don't be bitches and i will love you
1/2 is a pass I feel
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a math major
Awww tyty
speaking of math majors the history teacher I TA for just assigned a fill-in-the-blank 46 country map quiz worth 10 points in total
Never should have to go past hundredths
it's like almost as bad as a prime number
Prime numbers haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t heard that in a minute
for the time being we probably have enough mods BUT if we need another one given how active u are jen u are def in the running
i have to go to work in 10 minutes
np jen you stupid lesbian
That explains the math then
only straight people can do math
and there arent research ones
and they dont know how to do math
Did you just say a bad word?
i dont think so
IM LITERALLY GAY
i hate it here
Oh no
Yea I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think words like that should be used
we need a channel just for gay people cuz the straights cant handle it
Yo wtf
yeah im never gonna be able to run for any kind of public office
190 members already :eyes2:
smh someone doesnt kno rule 1
Oh no.
I wonder how many people here won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t attend cwru üëÄ
@addat someone is going to transfer to emory
oh yeah it doesn't matter that much rn but when y'all are choosing roommates make sure to pick someone who is already committed
Although we don't have roommates, this was still an issue last year
Damn Adam has ED
Adam Goodman, Class of 2024, Mechanical Engineering BSE has erectile dysfunctin @everyone
seems like a mechanical engineer could solve that on their own
nope that's BME
Adam do you want Zhanda to fix your ED?
Thats what he is trying to be able to do
I have repeatedly advocated for moving to #deleted-channel
but i have a presentation so bye
okay sorry
isnt ED a blood pressure problem though usually
And I thought submitting 10 mins before deadline was bad
Is it tho?
Last year the deadline was 1st jan
Nah you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d probably be able to answer it
@1800meggo there is one for the class of 2025 already
it's super dead though
i hate snapchat
i cant imagine the fb group is that active considering that a signficant portion of 17-18 year olds either do not have a facebook or avoiding using it at all costs
im not on groupme so i cant help u figure out how to get in the chat
unless it's like the few overlapping hours where all of the americans are asleep
because we all want to leave here
emma aint wrong, thats why theres a bunch of nj in our grade too
he's a TERRIBLE Diff EQ prof
Very test heavy + almost no projects/group work, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcomplicated√¢‚Ç¨
yeah also dont go around being like what's up im literally a child
But like- I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
i.e. don't be insufferable
i.e. dont b annie
i hate you
i am literally 12 it's pretty sad
really hard to get into engineering school when you have a frontal lobe the size and shape of half a walnut
@howdy_. youre talking big shit for someone whose shins are exactly within striking range
Hoepfullly I don't become a business major eventually üôÉ
whatever is happening, SOMEONE is getting shaded
it's ok u dont have to know yet
you simply don't need a degree in an engineering field that is mostly mech E but your research, ECs, and the classes you need to get good grades in are premed. Especially if you're doing it because you're unsure about being a doctor as a career then you shouldn't be a doctor so why get a "just in case" degree
yeah most bme jobs dont require a med degree
You need an engineering degree to be a patent lawyer
oop, didn't mean it as one
I guess we all have different things we find  boring hahaha
yeah just wanted to let you know
turns out people are bad at things they think are boring/uninteresting
yeah legal fields need to be full of ppl who enjoy it instead of people who are like "god i wish i was doing anything else"
It's happened in several instances and I guess college is to explore that too lol
damn beat me to the joke
they made someone else do it after they realized i was important
i still helped people not drill through their hand a lot
so i just had to sit there in pain like hHHhhHHH GEORGE WHEEERE IS THE BANDARIDs
one time we didnt want to put a piece of polycarb under the mill when we needed to cut a bigass hole for the RSL so we just used the largest bit size for a hand drill we could find and then we used a deburring tool to expand it by half an inch
the fuck
but I never ended up doing it
i've been doing it since 3rd grade. my dad got me a bunch of soldering kits for christmas and my EE career has kind of spiraled from there\
we almost didnt use the hand drill but one of our mentors walked in just as my boy dimitri was about to try to punch through polycarb with a drill bit in one hand and a mallet in the other
WE HAVE A DRILL PRESS WERE NOT FUCKING IDIOTS
electronics just tries to find ways to not have to get safety checks for powered machinery
when we arent all tied up in the bureaucracy
it also means that electronics on our team has a reputation for responding almost exclusively to the motivation to no longer be in excruciating physical and/or mental pain
this year and last year i was alone on electronics
FRC EE is actually really boring IMO
Me on the left
we manage to find ways to make it interesting on our team maybe you guys just suck shit
but we used to work out of a shed behind a barn
and it's really COLD
we used to work in a normal size classroom and it was dope
it's like doing work in a museum
I was trying to use it for class stuff but the latency was brutal
yes, and that's not even my actual room just my work space
If you want low latency for using dslr for webcam try investing in a hd60s or even a cheap capture card from amazon (they had a price hike like all things tech bec of the vid19)
Sorry had to geek out üòõ
Annie what you majoring in- I forgot my bad üòÖ
I actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I ever said while you were here!
what if i hate it
case is giving me so much money but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go somewhere that i hate the environment of
Idk if bigger case people can come UwU
I literally forgot this server existed and it was dead
And I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spend 24/7 here dw 
I have another server to mod ;)
Apparently the crime rate is pretty √¢¬¨‚Ä†√Ø¬∏√¢¬¨‚Ä†√Ø¬∏?
My bad, what I meant was apparently the crime rate is above average here
Apparently pretty well above average
I don't think campus is really dangerous unless I have the wrong impression
just dont go to east cleveland ü§™
scary but
just dont <3
Hey I grew up in the Bronx, doubt it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse than that?
Also got robbed at weapon point before sooo. Just trying not to die.
so bad lol
You just have to make sure not go out alone late at night and all
aw
unfortunately i will not be visiting
Same did you take the virtual one tho?
Maybe try that? Atleast you get the see the uni a bit (says the one who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take the virtual one himself yet)
yeah i got bored of it for a little while, but ive been getting into doing dsc and stuff with friends again
like my bad for liking bees i guess
oh its been awhile since ive played minecraft
im the type who would fuck around in shitholes like 2b2t lmao
it was down since like 2012 and then by chance he ran into one of the old mods on a big server and they decided to put it back up again
it would be fun to fuck up p2w servers by duping the shit outta the valuables and crashing their economies
back in the old days i had a mc husband but then he broke up with me because he was a terrorist
you dont have anything to hide
Also woodside damn so you're near silicon valley
Damn
if we had moved here this year we would not be able to afford my house
holy fuck
damn
most of silicon valley is either san mateo county or santa clara
except the aquarium im closer to the aquarium get dunked on
it's literally so fucKING INCONVENIENT
palo alto is all designed by stanford traffic engineers so its literally like just a grid with too many stop signs
Ah fair, the image in my head is palo alto so I'm probably being too harsh
I don't go that far south very often (ironically I'm in santa Cruz rn so bad example) but I went to the Facebook headquarters once so that's my image
Damn nice
like you have a conversation with them and you dont go "this conversation feels wrong"
and also that they arent allowed to go to therapy even though they clearly have depression
is that like a butterfly who was cut out of its coccoon so it didnt have to force its way out?
a butterfly who is like "mom i would like to leave the coccoon" and the mom says "no you have to stay in the coccoon because if you dont stay in the coccoon you wont get into stanford"
those things are slow, i dont like driving em
i love living in the bay area because a 2 bedroom house costs a million dollars, half of every graduating class has been hospitalized for suicide attempts, all the rich kids have giant illegal parties without getting in trouble, and everyone's parents went to stanford or berkeley so if you do worse than that youre a failure
Personally tho I live in strawberry which is on richardson bay and no one knows about. Its the cheaper tiburon
and also for half of the year you cant go outside without an n95 mask unless you want lung cancer
wtf
And pg&e doesn't help
OH ALSO I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT LITERALLY EVERY CA TEENAGER ALIVE AT THIS MOMENT IS LIKE A FUCKING *EXPERT* AT MAKING MEAL OUT OF ACORNS
FUCK pg&e
bro isn't PG&E just a governemnt scapegoat
or sorry not privatized
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting there in an hour
im just out here vibin all the time, don't have time for garbage
yea but my understanding, was that government refuses to do shit about the stuff they could and push it onto PG&E, although I hate them it is not all their fault. I may be wrong
the problem is that pg&e is incompetent and the government just doesnt bother to hold them accountable for their failure to function on a basic level
thats how the oil companies got their stranglehold on shit
and that's why our cars don't primarily run on hydrogen fuel cells yet
pg&e owns all of the power plants in the area, both renewable and non-renewable. their upkeep of power lines doesnt have anything to do with cars or the oil industry; the problem with pg&e is that they can't keep their power lines from setting shit on fire and so they will just stop giving us electricity for like a week at a time
and honestly compared to most areas in this country the CA government pretty much has their shit together
it's just they refuse to do anything about the fact that this very bad company keeps killing people willfully
that overhead keeps growing and growing and growing until it causes society to collapse
fuck that imma take my millions and buy a classy mansion
I actually earned on factions but man the whole environment was so damn toxic
u don't know toxic until u step foot in 2b2t lmfaoooooo
I owned one of those power factions that just turned the whole server useless and yeah ik 2b2t. Tcr gave it mainstream relevance unfortunately then other youtubers which fucked it up more
oh
Never played it tho because they had 1.9 pvp, rusher haha
ye i dont do abbreviations
But I miss those big ass group calls
im all over the place it really just depends on the mood
@tasfiqurrob i unfortunately do not have many rap recommendations i mostly listen to indie/alt and kpop :cursed_flushed:
not bad actually
bro listen to the VA11 HALL-A soundtrack if u need some study music
is my shit omg
it happened a long long time ago after all
True but the galaxy might've been too far away
Unfortunately I hear there's already lore explaining that line, and it has to do with the perspective of a certain alien species. I could be wrong tho, I'm like a tertiary source
it really shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be nsfw flaired
honestly might get rid of it before long just the creation of the channel seems to have caused people to be less horny on main overall
idk the concept is odd to me
To be completely honest I don't know how I got "valley girl"
the entire western half of the country is in serious danger of flooding
why do you think they call it death valley
bc ppl die there
Death valley: famous for flooding
it is death valley because people often die of drowning
that red circle is death
Also I just need to say that I'm in a number of college discords atm (cuz I suck at deciding where to commit) and this server is my favorite by far, y'all are awesome
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m only in this one and stanford. can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to leave stanford on april 9
sorry i was reading hannah's message and i got confused
i dont type good
WHY ARENT YOU GOING TO STANFORD RYAN
I didn't even apply to Stanford
I have uc berkeley in my blood even if I wasn't smart enough to get in
So I could never go to Stanford
My dad went to berkeley and then taught there while I was growing up so it's the only college I actually have a vested interest in
I applied but got rejected unfortunately
i didnt bother to send in the app but i listed stanford on the common app website so that my dad, who works in town government, could cite conflict of interest when boomers start being like "STANFORD WANTS TO LET PEOPLE OF COLOR INTO OUR AREA AND THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE"
not literally but a lot of rich kids in CA think that racism against asians isnt a problem and it's genuinely infuriating
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally just a stressor in my life that means nothing
SOMEONE BESIDES ME WHO SAYS OPE OMG
uh oh
someone never heard of the midwest
u cant blame him he's a valley girl üòî
It sounds like Japanese tho
i think you are pronouncing it wrong
ope sorry lemme just squeeeze right pascha there
i used to be friends with someone from michigan and ope migrated its way into my vocabulary during that time
Even they always sold out their donut
omg
Yeah idk wtf "in a around pronounce" means @jarvisthepooper
The Dunkin in my area always sold out their muffins and donuts
They only have coffee left
Wtf
And u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to type ur pin
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve not fking idea why some places need to type ur pin
U need to be big
That's too hard, I'll stick to case western school of engineering
genuinely tho if ur active and uve demonstrated an ability to not be a complete jackass u'll be considered for mod
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a basketball school
how much is too much to pay per year for college
also aside from jenin and @howdy_. our mods going forward are all gonna be 2025 ppl sorry boomers
generally speaking if they ask you for a blood sacrifice they probably arent a very good fit
ok jokes aside it depends on how much youre able to pay
wtf that reminded me of lil nas x's satan shoes LMAO
dude i would die for lil nas x
i wonder if theres anything put in the blood to make sure it doesn't dry up
i just think he's an iconic man and exactly the kind of representation the queer community needs
so far case is my cheapest school by far
Is that a money flex
1/2 the cost of my state school
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a no money flex
damn rly?
Cuz gov is useless
bro it's a single drop of blood inside the sole it would be weird if it didnt dry up
meets 100% demonstrated need
in state is cheap but still only pays for part of it
Middle class get more cuz √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re more likely to be success cuz their parents√¢‚Ç¨
surprised i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get bodied by need awareness tbh
Fair
depends on how much u make once u start working after school vs how much it cost to attend school
if you dont think you would enjoy yourself at case then no, i would say it's not worth it. you should attend because you want to attend. you shouldnt attend anywhere if you dont think you will fit in
Same omg were twinning
pain
I hate folding clothes
i gotta build some shit there
I can't with that low level stuff, I need high level software that's consistent across platforms. The whole "now run it to see if it's fried" attitude is not for me lmao
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t boo me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m right
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ten hours away
I committed without virtual or physical tour
oh ic, its cuz u can test shit on all different machines and it'll be compatible on them
and if i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into any of those i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m committing to case
bro san diego is so fucking HOT ALL THE TIME THO brO
cold > warm
I really hope I get off the uc santa Cruz wait-list tho
I agree im sick of the heat i wanna go somewhere cold
I am waffling cause I got a full tuition scholarship from ISU (so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cheaper than the SUNYs I got into) and 15k merit a year from UMN-TC but I kinda don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like either all that much
yeah i can't do humidity cuz it fucks up my skin and makes me feel like shit
otherwise temperature doesn't rly matter for me
cuz the vapor pressure of water is higher
also u need to factor in that if you go to sdsu you have to put up with 4 more years of your power getting turned off and breathing in the smell of burning plastic @hoping1 üíÄ
I feel my skin growing mushrooms
@hoping1 my ex goes to UCSC and according to him literally the entire school is either stoners or goths
also they were going to make a banana slug vtuber idk if that's still happening
That tells me everything I need to know about UCSC
honestly any school where the student body collectively elects a banana slug as their mascot is probably a school that vibes pretty hard
that temperate rain forest
there are like a million ppl from NJ alone lmao
I would be tired of life too if I lived in DC
i never said cwru is short
Fair
Cuz too close to the gov
cwru is too damn long
longer than ucsc
taxation without representation is literally their license plate
Rip
w is technically not longer than c im sorry to say
oh no xcrittyx
sad
My trick for remembering cwru (yes I need a trick) is to say "double-u" in my head but pronounce it dubber-u like I'm four, and turn that into dub-r-u
"in **case** you want to show stem superiority"
IK IVE BEEN SAYING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE IVE ONLY EVER HEARD "CALI" WHEN NOT IN CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU TYPE CALI THEN AUTOCOMPLETE SUGGESTS CALIFORNIA FOR YOU REEEE
if someone says "cali" u immediately know theyre a tourist
ur just jealous bc no one wants to go on vacation in ohio
Bruh my name is too long it can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show my major
Sad
and you cant vacation to a place u already on
it does on the computer version dw
I'm on my phone and I see it...
My only experience of cleveland is that as a bay area boi I'm supposed to hate your basketball team
rip
i dont follow him on instagram it's just that everyone at my school was like "why is steph curry allowed on campus and we arent"
not wrong
howdy im teaching him slang it's literally an important part of functioning on the internet
disagree football is boring baseball is the only one that's fun to watch because it's so completely batshit arbitrary
I can never keep up with all the stats tho
SHIT U RIGHT
do u get points for putting instrument in mouth though
if u dont it isnt sport
my head hurts
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the athletic or intellectual capacity for this discussion
I can die now
Die beef and die potato
Die potato die!
RIP Ryan 2003(?)-2020 let us honor his greatest achievement, getting quoted on discord
I'm gonna do an internet
You're leaving me
Hes never seen the og
I have multiple times fuck you
Wtf u on
They're still getting made so ofc I still watch them
theyre STILL GETTING MADE>/??
And im so sorry for u
Weather about to die
Its gonna be mixed rain n snow
dont slow down in east cleveland or youll die
U missed the only good day cleveland had
Why Canada can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call themselves America
i mean technically speaking it doesnt make sense to call it america americans just do that bc we're really bad at english
actually ontario is a territory it doesnt have representation yet bc it hasnt joined the union üòî
dude isnt british columbia the same thing as washington DC?? :cutethonk:
alright i gtg i have homework
this idiot doesnt even know georgraprhy
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an Asian and my nose is quite short so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not a liar
It needs more trash
Shit where did horny jail go?
Sad
Fair enough
Sleep for 4 hours or pull an all nighter before my 2 exams tomorrow
dog go to sleep
Idk in us
Honestly if I cant find halal meat options vegan/vegetarian go brrr
so far haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen a lot but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s eh
honestly zucchini goes hard
Omg we should have Indian food too!!!!
I LOWKEY CANT EAT INDIAN FOOD I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tolerate spicy
If you want to come to campus there's a ton of italian restaurants in little italy
im quite the opposite, i kinda need spicy shit to keep me going
bangladesh is quite close to india, is their taste for spicy shit also close to that of india's?
oh damn that's litty af
yeah true lao gan ma isnt that spice
Only spice I found close to the sub Indian continental taste was probably Mexican
i remember the first time i had one i lost my head for a hot hour and few minutes
still got 3 ghost peppers in my fridge from long ago
Ie just peppers alone
But I'm not on that so idk what they offer
Anyhow, gonna head to bed for 3 hours of sleep! Adios folks
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared to interrupt their conversatio
u wont no balls
I haven't heard of that one, I'd reccomend Etna Ristorante
oh no
which means protein is hard to get
and allow myself to get sick
I aint tryna shame but WHAT
bro dont knock it till u try it bugs are actually kinda tasty im literally ngl
My bad, whatever folks prefer just aint for me. Tried it in Thailand once
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m vegan and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still bad at being vegan after 2 years
Die
ALSO TO BE FAIR I AM TERRIFIED OF BUGS
ISHIKA DONT KNOCK UNTIL TRY
i could go vegetarian if i had to cuz then i can still have eggs, milk, cheese, and yogurt
i just slammed 8 egg sandwiches for dinner half an hour ago lmfao
but if the only thing u eat is white rice, u will get scurvy cuz that doesn't contain all the nutrients u need like vit c
dude get some fucking furikake on that shit
Holy lord 2.5hrs to sleep imma run
@rapidragon yo your name reminds me of bode plots, which is some shit we learned in circuits last fall lmfao
He got an exam
u will need to take circuits (ENGR 210) for engineering core
Yea pain
its a pretty sick class, and it got me to do EE instead of BME lmao
I hate circuits
Cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a boomer
Boomers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need electricity
that's sick
i havent looked
did someone ping me?????
I know someone in this damned server pinged me
he hasnt been active today but he's a class a shithead
I say howdy too often,guess I gotta leave the server
i still have the tour tomorrow tho
we aint in the inner city
my main memory of cleveland is seeing a car pull out of a gas station and casually crash into another car
doesnt surprise me
yeah cleveland seems more chill
ended up flipping the car
dunno if they survived
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still nice tho don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me wrong
oh
this isnt nyc
everything is closed b4 10pm
except for insomnia cookies
they open till 3
nah solebury school
Got nearly 3hrs gg
its so hard üò≠
hackensack is 30 mins from me
idk if i can get vaccinated in hackensack tho, im from ny
i suck too
but i have so many hours
how many hours in beat saber
yeah for cs 1.3k is nothing
but for the amount of hours i suck shit
but I can't bring my headset to my dorm
college ec?
damn
but then again I have nowhere near your amount of hours
T5000 isn't bad tho
570 still sounds impressive
i need someone to play cs with fr
i stopped playing mm
oml how is the ludwig subathon still not over, it was at 2 hrs yesterday morning
i dont watch him but my friend does
do you want
oh god oh jeez
im so sorry
@jellieellie paypal me fam, you made me hungry now i gotta order food smh
i'm still on the run from the coppers
Jen it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not our fault you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t control your ketchup smh
he just wont pay his restaurant bill
that reminds me of a story where a restaurant owner actually took someone to court when they didn't pay up for catering and won, so they have that case posted on their wall to get ppl to pay up lmao
Oh no
hunGry..
if i was i got shit to eat, tf yall on
you want some,,,, dont you?
Guys i think I lost some money and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bothering me a good bit
yeah i took it to pay for your fucking ketchup
so you want fries?
should you need KETCHUP with your fries
Oh NO!
oh
rip the fries
HOW SAD!
oh
fries will be the death of me...
ah right here you go, i forgot i had $10000 in my pocket
now i feel bad
so many pounds of cocaine i have dealt...all for nothing...
drug money??
nvm sadness gone
wtf is a free range tomato
wtf are you
Oh so like a tomato that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t grow on one of those cage things
tomatoes should never be caged
Oh yeah I should change my name I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not BME anymore
ikr don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we all just drink ketchup
Just order dinner. Imma miss cheap food bro
jen scammed me out of $6000 of hard earned drug money :crii:
Oh no
damn
no i havent but i prolly will
perhaps a study abroad
tho case makes the most sense
omg
Probably because you folks have an higher EFC so lesser need based? Rit gave me 19k merit and case gave me 21k but main difference was the need based aid for me
im middle class and im lucky enough to have a good college fund
well im glad im paying more so people who dont have as much college cash money can afford it
rob hasnt picked up on context clues
i have several pounds of cocaine left to sell
bad, dont feed the bme premeds
Ah crap link why won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you work üò¶
cuz its not #self-promos
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s *charity tho*
Why jen, who hurt you? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get my butter knife
from school
simply dont do school
will case change their mind and reject me if i fail all my classes
if you fail yes, if you pas w/ C's no
Jen probably the kid that makes college reaction vids with 4.0 gpa saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìomg my grades were so bad I had a B in mandarin in first semester of 9th grade√¢‚Ç¨
oh
i get worse grades in my easier classes its weird
i dont much get the appeal of those
except my dad is from bergen county
oh yeah p close
AHHH i go to school by ridgewood
wait no she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sorry
i was considering rutgers but heard many bad things
I grew up in Bronx so the term √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNY gang√¢‚Ç¨ is taken too literally üòÇüòÇ
folks i have a physics test but my allergies are acting up and i cant see out of either of my eyes i feel like this should be considered special circumstances
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in a sour mood in all my visits because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the last stop before I fly back to HK
you might be able to make it if u swim the wrong direction when youre trying to commute to case
i'm a mod i do what i want
imagine if u ended up half bull half fish thats the real loss here
without all of the things that people
just burn his eye
honestly i think korra was awful too in the beginning because she still went after him even after she knew he had a girlfriend
except bo lin
i didnt agree with a lot of korra's decisions
like korra arbitrarily chose a reason to hate asami's dad and instead of having to learn that she's being unreasonable the story actually sides with her and it turns out she was right even tho she had literally 0 evidence
okay tbh bolin is literally my least favorite character even tho i hate nearly everyone in lok
no i couldnt stand aang he would blow up at people for no reason and he was super immature
aang was ok in seasons 1 and 2 but by season 3 he was making the same mistake over and over and never learning from it
like in season 3 aang is like I KNOW IN FOUR DAYS THE WORLD WILL LITERALLY END but I WANT TO HAVE A DANCE PARTY and like it was that energy every episode for an entire season without permanent consequences
like i just really wanted to scream at korra for being an idiot but aang was not nearly as bad
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìi would rather kiss you than die, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a compliment√¢‚Ç¨
i mean i also dont like aang or katara
u mean when toph wasnt helping set up camp T__T
toph is like "look i set all my own stuff up im not gonna participate in helping you guys" and then katara gets angry with her so at night she says "HEY TOPH THE STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT TOO BAD YOU CANT SEE ANYTHING"
oh jeez
i really like how tenzin is wrong sometimes and that his daughter teaches him a lot
yeah katara is kind of annoying but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think she was necessarily awful
I hate that the live action is aging her up though because that takes away half her personality in the animated version
like i def had a crush on suki growing up but watching it back now i was like ok shes lowkey a little boring
shes still hot tho like please kick my ass suki
idk i have kind of a love-hate relationship with the series
i hate mai and zuko and katara/aang is meh
halfway through season 2 sokka transitions from annoying to the most reasonable character in the series
MAI AND ZUKO ARE SO NOTHING
yeah same here i thought a lot of things about korra were awful
even at the beginning he was annoying but at least he wasnt boring
IKR I HATE THEM their relationship is so wack
i never really thought zukka fit together as more than friends
also i dont like "shipping" the characters much bc theyre all like. children
thats the main thing i didnt like about aang and katara is like.. aang is 12. he's too young to be KISSING PPL
literally not even pubesced yet
i only really "ship" characters in romance animes lolol
i think they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re adults by the end?
yeah same here i always felt weird about shipping characters in atla except for sokka and suki because they were actually in an established relationship and weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too young imo
dude yeah ugh im too lazy to read the comics so im just starved
yeah but i thought the way they did it was awful which sucks for me
like when i watched lok korrasami never made sense to me at all until i heard about what happened in the comics after
i never finished korra tho bc i couldnt get past the spirits season
Oh I thought the show was awful except for season 3
And korra stops being awful in s4
ngl i forgot a lot lol
dont tell me anything P L E ASE
i promise i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
no T__T and i havent had time to watch anything recently
oh shit gl!!
anyone else trying to go for the david foster wallace vibe at the end of high school
(you saw nothing)
Ellie exposed 2021 gone wrong
how does being exposed go wrong
the camp I applied to be a counselor for worded the hiring letter just like a rejection letter I got so scared
Fr? Mine didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t üò¶ I was RD
oh for ea we had no confetti in the decision letter which sucked
Case has a lot of asian folks/asian americans which I find cool because I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stick out like a sore thumb haha
mine was kinda lame
awwww ing
omg*
Maybe they just wanted different kind of people. It all depends.
nope
i just happened to apply to two schools in ohio
yeah if it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t holistic i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be screwed
frick rice for rejecting me tho üôÑüôÑ
oh and northwestern rejected me for ed, rude
i think case was a hard target for me? i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t check the acceptance rate til after i got in lmao
I was very low on confidence that I kinda didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even dig into it much. Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d get in at all
maybe they are hard targets then
i only applied to one target because my other target ended up becoming more of a reach i think
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what to consider barnard. my stats make it a target but the acceptance rate says otherwise üòÉ
perhaps hard target/low reach
Oh I think since it's an all girls college it's easier to get in
my college essay was fire ngl
no i really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know üò≠
And she said that so idk
yeah idk if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d want to go to an all girls school but barnard seems cool just because you can take classes at columbia
Applied to 19 colleges üòõ i was low on confidence. Had bad grading system but great board exams + I think above average ECs so put effort into my essays and shotgunned
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like columbia for the core curriculum
if i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into barnard or any of my reach schools im going to case
sorry
oh
im honestly extreme sleepy
same wtf
I just ran a meet and am dead
i got candy from dollar tree now i have a stomach ache lol
Domestic student studying in a Bangladeshi high school that follows UK curriculum so yes and no kinda
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kinda sadüò≠
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve lived in the same house except Durning summers
so like u√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never moved?!???
the farthest i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been from home is DC
nope
WTF
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine that lol
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never moved but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been on vacations
i mean we're rich white people so we take vacations but our actual address hasn't changed in 16 years
the longest i've been out of town was like 3 or 4 weeks
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been to the midwest
My grandparents have a beach house and I wen to summer camp though
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not much here tbf
not the city city unfortunately
just the boring suburbs
Hard, I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t plan to move back to usa for uni so I basically did things I actually wanted like starting a charity so my grades went whooop. But Case valued me so yay!
Moving to a new country kinda sucks
pain. that was my dream school for a while
nooo way how come you never mentioned? :O
I DID THO
my grandfather used to work in a pharmacy in the bronx
really? i dont remember ever hearing about it ü§î
duke, northwestern, usc, austin, rice, any engineering school
i really wanted to go to a city school but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think case is
u dont talk about it very often
A lot of the kids I went to school with dropped out or in trouble or sadly, dead.
my sister goes to my state school
damn
thats the problem with applying to 19 schools dude u didnt have enough time to research and discern between them
i mean technically i applied to 9 but i withdrew all the apps so they dont count
only really had 4 i was interested in though
Only 11 schools for me- I didn't research enough purely because im a lazy son of a bic
one of my schools forgot to actyally withdraw my app when i hit the withdraw button ;-;
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna see if they have any social media manager role. I have a decent portfolio. And actually case was literally the only one I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t research much, only looked at the data sci program and campus etc not some of the other things that I really care about
dont manage their social media til u know abt the school bro
aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t robots supposed to be taking over jobs anyways
he's literally like 8 years old they cant hire him
i mean i built surgical robots at 16, if you want to work for case's publicity stuff just go bother them until they let you lol
Oh shit
come work at KSL
are leaving
i want to work at the library ngl
i dont like accs like that
oh
i hate the word females
I haven't heard of them
connotation bad
Ran by 10PMCurfew I used to work for them too when they were Hype Blv.
no they post like. period jokes and stuff idk
When I ran the pages it was fashion mainly haha
oh lololol
college tiktokers are gross
you ran a social media account called @female that was all about fashion
Idk what they did them now tho but I dont use tiktok
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so elitist i saw one call a 1370 a bad score üíÄ
oh my god the hustle culture of college advice pages makes my blood boil
getting 3 hours of sleep a week is not a flex kyle
But trust me that gig aint last long
oh  my bad i didnt realize it was complicated
idk I just play stuff I find on the internet
College application Reddit is full of people saying shit like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI have a 6.0 gpa, cured cancer, and am currently President of the United states, do you think I can make it into Princeton? Or should I settle for community college√¢‚Ç¨
are you trying to silence me
dude @female is trying to censor u rn
but once it gets above a 5 weighted gpas are annoying
I forgot that existed
SAT more like SAD
Test options goes brrr
Anyone else here that went test optional?
it sucks that you have to pay money for it
i am so freaking happy that the sat phase of my studying is over because it is repulsive
SAT more like Pay Us Five Hundred Dollars We Are A Useless Corrupt Money Laundering Scheme
I studied for 6 months for the sat and saw a 300 point increase in my practice scores and never got to take it üòÄ
but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t submit it to my hard reaches
Took it three times then applied test optional because I didn't like my score
no my grades were too terrible to not redeem myself with high test scores
I got a 1410 on the psat but never took the sat. So I'll just brag about my psat lmao
i went test optional because my PSAT score and my grades were comparable so it wouldve been a waste of my time
i studied basically every day for an entire summer for each subject test (sophomore-junior for physics, junior-senior for math II) and like two years for the ACT
holy crap dude
i didnt cuz i did well on the act so i only submitted that
took the psat online and the sat on paper ü§™
And now subject test don't really matter as much
My school never taught half the stuff on the sat üòª
wanted to see how much I could learn
Very stressful. Like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhere you go, a test where you dont have time to answer things you know√¢‚Ç¨
Ha I went to a private school that very explicitly wasn't planning on teaching what was on the sat or act
ended up getting an 800 on physics and 790 on math II, which I was super excited about but the more I think about it the more I realize those tests are just doing so many practice tests that you could write the test yourself
I feel like the tests were more about time management than learning
yeah i took one act practice and did bad so i just stuck with the sat
like the stuff on the SAT is like fundamental for all subsequent math
not terrible but not how i wanted to do yknow
I never had geometry because covid got rid of it :uniqua:
uh oh
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on a couple waitlists tho so might transfer out, doubt jt tho
dude the whole point of committing is that you dont transfer out after :blobsweat:
it was at this moment sreeja realized
u signed a legal agreement lmaoo like u can transfer but u lose ur deposit and also other colleges get notified that you backed out of a committal
oh shit üòÄ
And they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll allow you to lose the deposit and attend
and backing out of the school
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fine as long as backing out of the committal doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean anything
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just lose that $500 if you back out
nothing else
they do notify schools to let them know that u backed out tho a lot of schools wont care if they know you got in off the waitlist
So I'm in the same boat but haven't committed anywhere yet. since waitlists come out after may 1, what's standard procedure? Cuz obviously you need to commit somewhere before then
Ewww it turned my emoticon into a emoji
yeah i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it either
if it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come out by june 30 you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not in and you can continue
You commit by may 1st. If u wanna go to a waitlist you make it clear and commit there lose ur deposit here
but if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re admitted you make the choice to change and lose your deposit
nothing bad will happen, just losing that money
ok so u lose ur deposit either way
Yes that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all or you take the risk of not getting into any waitlist and lose the other offers for not committing by may 1st. In short u did the right thing dw
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when bad things happen
why would the colleges care anyways tho
then again it doesnt say anywhere in their admittance that they can pull ur acceptance back if they find out ur a dumbass so like
If you go to a waitlist acceptance that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s standard procedure don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t freak out
forgot
Why would someone do this tho
cause they pressed the wrong button i guess idk
idk some ppl are just dumb
I'm incredibly on the fence about case but that means I'm close
lmk when tho! :D
Doesn't everyone want to live in juniper?
I kinda wanted to go for suite or apt style but people suggesting to go for juniper ones which are all communal i think
i mean unless they dont like big ass bathrooms
isnt nyu√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s original cost of attendance like 90k
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even fathom 90k
but still
i knew i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go to cali so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even check
My cost of attendance is 8k but I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reported my outside scholarships yet üòéüëçüèº
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve always wondered like- there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not way it takes even 2/3 of combined average college costs to run a college and pay some professors like wtf
whoops sorry
yeah i wish mine was that low wtf üò≠
My bad
Sorry üò¶
DONT REPORT OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared for next year because my sister is graduating and it Will increase

omg u got a 100 on the sat?? bro u literally passed
getting an A on the SAT
really low res but
damn <3 isok
omg
God damn !!
aint that the pasta dish?
yeah like lowkey talking about what schools u got into or what text scores u got will just make ppl feel bad and makes u come across as shallow
Wtf what do you think I'm trying to do? This isn't a fishing for compliments thing I literally was curious which schools. I got waitlisted at a couple schools myself which I've been super upfront about, the thought that there's something to do with accomplishment there hasn't crossed my mind in the slightest and I'm certainly not being sneaky
Woah what happened here
If they are cursing nonstop I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it
I'm sorry but I feel like taking something I say and posting a self righteous monologue to make it seem like I'm a damn bottom feeder is something I have a right to push back on. This feels incredibly unfair
that's not what he was trying to do at all.
look ryan we're giving you an out here please take it this is just making everyone feel bad
A PLANE
birds arent real
i hate birds
birds arent REAL
Either as pets or fried
@jellieellie doesnt like fried birds üòî
I'll take the out even if I don't accept 100% responsibility
Ooh rly? I forgot
Sorry if I came off this way earlier yesterday I know this wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t addressed to me but I was personally just looking for advice cause I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m having a difficult time deciding between schools (especially when it comes to the financial side of things cause I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand money) idk
Lmao uh if you don't mind I'm taking myself off the platform for a few minutes
fair enough
birds work for the boojwazee
First of all, it is not self-righteous, and you're not a bottom feeder. But you don't ask people how much money their parents make, and saying things like "you'd have to pay me to live where you live" invades a certain level of privacy. There are *many* people who are just used to their common app being their introduction, and i get that you guys have been stressing about this for months.
Doesnt some major college have a chicken as their mascot?
Oh nah South Carolina
Nvm I guess I'm staying on the platform..

Hi guys!! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking of applying to CWRU ED and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m really hoping of getting in. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m genuinely curious though, are there a lot of hot guys there? And girls too? Like I am very curious. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen some stereotypes online saying that generally the girls aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very pretty so I was curious if it was the same for the guys. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m asking like in general, I know every school has some very good looking people but I wanna know if the majority are hot people, both genders. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m from Cali so my standards are kinda high.
im really shallow
Yea, if anyone wants to doxx Annie's reddit here u go:
https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/j7se3n/hot_people/
As an incredibly handsome man myself, I can say that this school has a pretty damn attractive male population. Jokes aside, I would say most people at Case are pretty well put-together, and I feel like once you're past that threshold it's more about personal preference. It sounds like you're just looking for conventially attractive people to hook up with, and based on what I've seen, Case seems to be a pretty good place for that. If you have sufficient tinder game I'm sure you'll be able to pull as many hot guys as you need. You may find some difficulty getting prospective mates to stop playing video games and/or studying to engage in romantic activity.
i'm 5' 11" idk if that's tall
Apparently that is tall there

so admission is not that bad
if you want to take private lessons, you have to pay extra :D

I had a kid live in a tent in my hallway for a week last year
He found out his roommate sold dick pics on reddit and couldn't emotionally handle that
i hope it wasnt on his bed or something
Apparently somebody else found the reddit, sent it to him, and seeing this man's erect penis with all of his stuff in the background was too much to handle
I don't blame him
who the fuck wants pictures of dicks
cuz thats the only way i could see someone paying for this
I bet he just saw the massive size and got jealous, knowing he couldn't compete
howdy trust me not even sugar mommas want pictures of penises
smh my head
anyway penises are just kind of fundamentally unappealing even ppl who are attracted to ppl with penises don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to see that
howdy just because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gay doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m homosexual
all their merch says GO NADS! on it it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so blessed
aw
we dont have that here

It's kind of expensive tho
@here why do ppl hate it when they get pinged

Nope. Are you a marwadi?
I guess you could just club me into marwadi
You won't believe me if i told you
Nah cause
Not yet, due to fin aid. If that goes thru, I most likely will
Pain
Oh it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s snowing
Damn
damn
we either have to fight or form a coalition of hannahs
There are plenty of vids about cleveland if you want a taste of a land that is not Detroit
I've seen so many tours today going in spite of the damn blizzard this morning
I miss organizing in person ones. Been too long man. But yeh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bound to happen. Especially with random orgs hosting them
also there are probably more christians of various flavors than there will be mormons in pretty much any place except for the state of utah
i was so confused i really need a nap
tbf hannah they really ought to have come up with a name for their holy book that doesnt look that much like moron
sucks 2 be them
It's not snowing anymore
Still driving over though
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been on here in forever but :dab: catch me hitting that √¢‚Ç¨≈ì*confirm enrollment*√¢‚Ç¨ button on my portal tonight
i havent seen snow in like 6 years
During my lifetime there hasn't been but a single flake where I grew up, tho we have driven to places where there's snow so it's not like I don't have experience. I wish I lived in a place where it does snow tho
there hasnt been but a SINGLE flake
like i dont think im gonna get tired of snow snow makes me so happy all the time
it snows a lot where i live and while it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nice i hate cleaning up my driveway once it snows
i see snow and im like HOLY FUCK!!!!!! OH MY GOD
Tho more so for rain for me
Oh no
The sound of rain on the roof is such a deep emotional nostalgia for me idek know why
I usually managed the behind the scenes. The marketing, media connections, stage work etc.
i used to run tech all the time but robotics started conflicting with the plays it was ANNOYING
but i ran tech for all our kazoo concerts üòä
YEAHH dude any event that happened in the theater all the techies would run up to the booth instead of sitting in the stadium and then we'd just do homework while 2 ppl ran tech
yeah every year since my freshman year the robotics team puts on a kazoo concert to raise money for charity
our school requires that clubs fulfill a community service requirement or else they will not allow them to reform the next year
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find creative ways to fundraise which sucks. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m planning to do an online quizzing comp of sorts so lets see
Just tried and just gave up
Very fair point
I feel like if you guys had more of a General concert it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d raise more but the production cost would probably be more as most schools don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that stuff
no the thing about our school is that students are way the fuck more likely to attend a kazoo concert performed by people with minimal musical talent than they are to attend a concert with any kind of production value
I missed that so much man it was late 2019
All of them were by students but we had a production company for the stage work + me and another senior
It was like much cheaper than it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be in usa tho
We turned a few thousand profits last year
let alone an unofficial kazoo concert that we didnt arrange beyond just asking to book the PAC for three hours on a thursday afternoon
i hope it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t snow in chicago bc i wanna longboard üòêüòêüòêüòê
longboard on ice u wont no balls
i go to a catholic school we have benedictine monks that live on campus
we actually had one of them perform a hymn on kazoo last year it was based
Cleveland snow seems kinda chill, like doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look too harsh atleast the one that took place today
that's spring snow. winter snow is worse
Annie will now go around breaking hips for future precautions √¢‚Ç¨≈ìif you get it now you wont need it later√¢‚Ç¨
ohio can get pretty muggy in the summers but the good news is we wont be on campus for much of it
then again u will be leaving campus during the ohio summer to go to bangladesh summer so it's not exactly an upgrade
yeah he doesnt want admin finding out about his 31 wives so dont tell anyone
a lot of engineering schools i mightve been able to deal with being in the vast minority except the thing is that a lot of those schools also have really bad sexism problems
Apparently RIT got stalking issues
Well yeah, its very low. But I meant the stalkers. Apparently it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a common thing so yeahh not gonna go to RIT

midwest grammar is hard im gonna sound like such a tourist
Oh yeah speaking of, what is a california accent? Like I've heard of it but idk what the specific differences are
my dad thinks that palo alto has its own accent
Hard for@me to differentiate accents

What you got Bobby hooked on that he keeps crashing lol
lmk if you need help programming, I have maybe 10 hours experience but it's fun
if you use discord.js then I can't help at all though
My friends prefer discord.js but I've never made a bot that wasn't a fun small side project and python is just better for that than any other language imo
I have a server that I throw all my shit on
does he bonk us for horniness yet
not yet, i need to move him from being hosted on my laptop to being hosted on one of my servers first
currently working on language parsing for annie's "does he bonk us for horniness yet" feature
Oh god a whitelist sounds hard
no the idea is he should react with a bonk if someone says something naughty
yes, but that won't be as effective
Wouldn't be fast but even a local one wouldn't
yeah, but i'm an edgy programmer who likes to live dangerously and develop his own shit to do that kind of stuff
omg bob
LMAO IT DOESNT KNOW CAPS
zacc u suck at programming
I still have to do that for mine
shut up i don't use python
oh no
poor bobbot
You forgot the most important line

bob for short
idk-?
it changes year to year
has this server turned into a bob cult
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have social skills
my system has been to just go into every conversation with the pure anxious energy that i feel at all times
that way there arent expectations that i will be able to uphold basic social competence in the future
i will literally just leave conversations halfway through
no. scary
Fun fact about me, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m way too horrible with words
but then we dont even social
i literally dont uybnderstand that
have u ever gone to the movies with a friend
i feel like you would need way more people for that to work tho
scribble isnt silly enoygh
Tee-KO has had times where i've legit wanted to buy the shirt
i see so many ppl playing mad verse city and i am dying to play it
Mad verse city is so good omg
survive the internet
i dont like monster seeking monster but i think its bc i never play with enough ppl
you need a full house
patently stupid and talking points can be good if u have the right people
mainly talking points tho
pls someone hold me
cuz everyone's gay for :bob:
Also I still want a partnership as a QPR with a girl, but not romantic or sexual

i also dont know anyone named madison
if you broke it down
idk what this megan shit is
ur num 44 on dudes tho
clearly they wanted a guy
no my parents just wanted to get to the name evan before anyone else in the family could
as long as they dont see the name Evan Hughes and go "who the FUCK is this CELTIC ASSHOLE??? im LITERALLY racist against the welsh"
crying at the fact that you searched zac the first time
i didnt get any hits for anything besides zachary

The next time I get buzzed by a person on a skateboard I'm going to throw marbles everywhere like a home alone trap and they'll fall
when I walk to work and class and to the quad.
Oh no
bobbot is kill
$bye
getting emails from case without bob makes me sad
holy shit
I just realized bob's actual name is Rob ie Robert, big oof
It seems I have been spotted
Im lost
other people might feel bad if you were accepted into a school that rejected them, or be uncomfortable with discussions of aid.
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually committed to prager u, I hope I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in trouble for violating my ED agreement :cursed_flushed:
Atleast they both have one thing in common üë©√¢‚Ç¨√¢¬§√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ç¨üíã√¢‚Ç¨üë© they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist üò©üò©ü§≠ü§≠ü•µü•µ
i went to get a covid test at CVS today
and the swab was like, 75% longer than the vial
what the fuck?
i much perfer the spit test, so i couldnt tell ya if something was wrong there
if i didnt do that the liquid would have spilled everywhere cus the cap woiuldnt have gone on
there was some scholarship that was released on the 1st, i dunno if there are any past that, u should be able to check on ur portal
Everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been quite lately it seems
you do hate it when people b quite
Yeah it seems people are sad, and sad = bad.
i am sad
Need some Netflix series suggestions, if anyone got any, feel free to drop them!
Why only ep 6 tho üëÄ
keep reading this as Annie? out of the corner of my eye and being like WHAT HAPPEN
are u still working rn ()_()
this is my job not nursing school silly
yea but tbh clinical never lasts that long
work is 8.5 hr shifts
see this is why i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad. i work in fast food cuz i can mess w someone without killing them
or like doing something seriously wrong
even tho on my floor we get report directly from the nurses not from pcnas
Nah being a librarian is like a masters or some shit
This degree is hard enough
Gotta learn all the coding systems n shit
Ugh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so much work
Guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to be a nurse how sad
settling for nursing, now you can never know the dewey decimal system
If I were young and beautiful I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone to work at my local library over the summer
But apparently I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m too old for that now üòî
One of my options was to work as a camp counselor
Over my dead body lol
Fuck them kids
working w/ kids in general
kids are ok when they're not acting spoiled and have gotten 12 hours of sleep
They no longer Fear
There was an option of daycare and if I get a call back that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t for that job I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll b üíîü•≤
There was also the forest preserve but I do not live near a forest and refuse to drive out of my way to work near one
I no longer remember what my credit card looks like
u really need to find it lmao
However it was confirmed that I left it at home
And I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll never spend crazy money for no reason
Luckily I have not created a bond w a local cleveland shop, so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still a little under control
If everything goes back to normal in the fall as Scott has promised me, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to leave all my money at home
Awh I feel sorry for ya. Are you on a co-op or something? No clue how nursing works but aye just gotta deal with it I guess
The 2024 fb page was full of boba lovers which is really sad because Cleveland is not the place you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d wanna go for that
Fuck
doesnt that place near hecc do it too
The poke place? Nah they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
huh, i thought they did rip
i guess the one by hecc doesnt
Just another reason to go back home over summer
You can never leave ohio, it is impossible
I'm Asian and I have never had boba
have you had bob-a tho
:c don't want his balls in my drink
Unfortunately not
sad
üò≠  crying myself to sleep
He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tired, please don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake him
woahhhhh i haven't checked this server in a while
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake bobbot
oh
its completely normal to change plans before you actually start college
went from polisci & cs to here already
decided i like to read and write but not that much and that i suck at coding
but it's not terrible
idk about chem tho i can check
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not *that* bad at it and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate it but i could not do a whole major in it
oh yeah. a few of my friends who took java last semester said that it's not a class for beginners
Fuck matlab.
i simply don't try in that class otherwise im sure i would understand it
actually. It is a necessary evil in my life. My rockets wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t run without it, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a garbage language compared to something like python or Java
because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want my whole life to be consumed by chemistry
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like chem either
chem bad
Physics mechanics is just super boring
i hate physics
cant handle the *gravity* of the situation
damn
dont let it *weigh* you down
not as bad as physics you can't and won't change my mind
plz ignore pri, she is just wrong
i don't care how a block moves on a surface
that class was brutal at my hs
physics 2 makes me want to smash my head against a wall
actually every ap class was unnecessarily difficult at my hs except for econ and gov
well my school doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have ap physics 1
and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in ap physics 2 and i hate it more
*cant even use emotes smh my head*
you'll hate chem here more
didnt learn a damn thing
cuz he didnt teach a damn thing
and even then i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have ap physics 1 credits and idk how case will treat that
idk how they can give you credit for phys 116 (second sem physics for neuro). they may make you take 115 and you just don't take 116
take the exam and snag that credit, speaking from personal experience
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking all my exams because my teachers will waive the final exam if you take the ap exam
i mean seniors can exempt all their finals here
cant relateüòô
sorry bbg
people in my class love to complain when we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even do that much ü§ßü§ß
hoping that most of them fail out, last i checked my ex-friend had like a c in her prereq calc class so
nurses are evil!!!! cancel nurses!!!!! get twitter hq on the phone!!!!!
bc one of my friends told me that all the mean white girls b nurese and say they want to "help people" and that only ppl who can do nothing more can b nurses
and it makes me so sad
i literally cry when someone asks me my major im like uh
üò©  i hate it here
u want a healthcare job without losing out on the prime of ur life by spending it in school LMAO
sorry to all u med students
*she's not sorry*
same here. ik it sounds mean but i hope they don't become nurses
so instead of nursing they're pre med
honestly i think nursing gets a lot of hate BECAUSE of how a lot of mean girls pursue the career
like please don't plague the career like that
alot of death prob aint helping either
that's fair, we're all human. but im talking about the energetic rude nurses
OMG
god damn it
i was hoping
would steal it away
omg i-
sorry :LAUGHING:
OMG THEY BACK
sorry L>
the emote monarch restored apparently
last time i went was a sunday
so they were closed
very sad
oh sad
me and dhnanjay had to get boring panera instead
panera indeed boring :Culture:
omg
getting a normal sleep hour
i feel like putting memes in general
lol because I heard it's harder than other chem classes but I guess it forced us to learn idk
i want a hoodie but they're expensive for no reason
i want a hoodie
bc i got that earlier
damn it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m jealous i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a package
i just want to feel loved :(
NO FOR REAL I GOT SOME REALLY GOOD ASS SPICY HUMMUS PACKETS IT WAS CALLED TACO HUMMUS IT TASTED SO FUCKING GOOD I ALREADY ATE ALL OF THEM CUZ THERE WAS ONLY 3 AND IT CAME WITH LITTLE TORTILLA ROLL CHIPS OH MY GOD IT WAS SO GOOD I NEED TO GET MORE
i dont like the texture
sabra hummus is bad
theres no trader joes near me
oh dang
theres one in my whole state and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in the town next to mine
i feel bad but
also i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even eat meat so
oh
theres literally so many other chicken fast food places
that dont donate to conversion therapy
you didnt know?
i never had it
donate a good portion of their money even after saying they would stop
one time like four years ago my dad and i got out of a concert and went to chick fil a at 10:01 and they closed xx
and we donate to charities that are GOOD and dont encourage gay trauma
except ohio is literally the epicenter of white castle
columbus tho not cleveland
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no white castle near me
sad
ok sad
lmk when u want falafel cafe
I'm trying to listen to King Lil Nas X and it keeps coming on
And I do not want to hear it
Ea or RD? Still ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get mine üíî
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still cool af tho
are you like dying it?
she has multiple colors of thread so she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dye them herself
it's like skype but it doesnt make you want to gouge your eyes and ears out
damn, is the bot down?
even bob needs sleep
Shh don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake him up
if i gotta be awake, he's gotta be awake
tirelessly working
i personally haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t decided to commit yet, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very likely that I will.
still waiting on a couple more schools
fml
The profs don't actually teach it's just grad students
the thing that makes case so much better than ivys in my opinion is the lack of competition and the entire school feeling like they need to prove to everyone else that they're smarter than them
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be praying i get rejected from the rest of my schools though
wtf is this
ive been trying to find a cool pattern for so long
Why do we suck at football? üòñüòñüòñ
nerd school :shookpensive:
can't have everything now can u?
nerd school üòé
do u want me to make one
And nah you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to
im just bored and want to make something :( so i will make turtles
there's another zach brown in the class of '25 who is a football player
really????
(maybe u arent straight then)
damn okay I see how it is
i wish i had some nuggies
i don't eat plants as much as i should
i avoid soy usually because it's terrible for the environment
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard to avoid everything that is harmful for the environment
but there are much better plants to eat besides soy if you want to go vegetarian
mass farming is also very bad for the environment tbf zacc
because we've started growing soy in places where it isn't native, it needs a ton of lime and a bunch of synthetic fertilizers that aren't great, and absolutely trash the water supply around the area it's being grown
but like meat production is bad for the environment too so
kinda fatty though
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to rip my boca spicy chik√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢n patties out of my cold dead hands
NOO i dont like boca üò≠üò≠
as a vegetarian i actually hate vegetables
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like morningstar
what omg
well i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m vegan so i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat 1/2 of their stuff
i have nothing against vegans but i do think that it's gotten kind of out of hand in certain areas
they made their corn dogs vegan then they disappeared from my stop&shop and that made me sad
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tend to tell people tbh
oh no
except the whole gmo thing is BS because we've been genetically modifying our crops since like 2000 bc
imma head out
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sad because there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing i can do to save him without endangering myself
if you save him he'll probably be chill about it
well except Monsanto products, because fuck Monsanto
wasps tho
bees are great wasps suck ass
wasps are motivated by destruction and pain
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live on the ground floor so i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take my screen off
i never open my window because bugs get stuck in it
why is your screen outside of the wimdow
in my in person sages class last year there was a giant wasp one day that was super distracting
okay this is way off topic but on the wiki for obsessive compulsive disorder they refer to the DSM-5 as the DSM-V when its supposed to be the arabic numeral not the roman one
AND I CAN'T EDIT THE PAGE BECAUSE MY WIKI ACCOUNT IS TOO YOUNG
at least the word man isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a completely different alphabet system
man i remember when people in middle school and the beginning of high school were like "i'm so ocd" meanwhile i was thinking to myself "bitch i washed my hands for half an hour this morning"
that doesnt seem very scienctific
especially for anxiety where you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwell it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad Im just a loser√¢‚Ç¨
yeah I ended up getting a diagnosis for anxiety because I was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwell I mean it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not really that bad. like I throw up like four times a day but like whatever I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just a wimp everyone else deals with the same level of stress that I do I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just a loser about it√¢‚Ç¨
oh my god like why did every ounce of knowldege just leave my brain
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s me with my chemical slurry that makes my brain work
body of a man
head of a muppet
i dunno
i've found not taking my pills makes me more creative and better at the invention part of my work, but terrible at the doing part.
if it helps jules Im bringing a 4 foot long extruded furby
just find a roommate who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have puppet fear
@jellieellie is such a good roommate im so blessed to have found someone who is not just OK with but actually ecstatic about my terrible furby monsters
I'm reading chat and I'm thinking, isn't a furby just a small plush
holy shit let me show you
oh dear god
oh shit oh fuck
he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have ears he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a wormby
I have another smaller one who is a proper long furby
but I got bored with that idea
waking up in the dead of night
soft robotics furby would be kinda sick ngl
what you really want is some custom soft robotics
idk the word for it but the snakelike structure with cables on the sides you can change the length of might work
there isn't really a word for it
that just describes the underlying mechanism though
https://polarislist.com/ if you want your brain to be broken
i got the package from cwru today and it had everything but a shirt god freaking dammit
pain.
sad
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared this is gonna taste bad

i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve tried their bacon and chicken pieces
lil rubbery but i wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expecting much because i messed up like 3 things while cooking
Atleast people ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cut throat here so yay (from what I can tell)
Yet no one out here chatting üò¶ sad tales
there's no grey heart emoji
close enough
it seems as though i am committing to case
they used to b blue and white w/ the fat surfboard mans
i never woulda thought grey üòÆ
I accidentally cut a hole on my bag
Pain
I didn't even have to cut mine. It just ripped open the day after I got it :(

fastweb seems like a scam basically

what if i want to collect ghosts
if i ever get a head injury I'll need the "case alumn" discount
you wouldn't know her she goes to a different school
i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to commit now and get in off a waitlist early
oh no I have been spotted
can we fix it?
only thing robbot would say is "I'm confused" or "I'm lost"
i dyed my brows again today and was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need vaseline, the dye won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dye my skin√¢‚Ç¨ well guess what
I literally left it in for like half an hour why is my stupid hair so healthy

he'll still talk about admissions though
üò© regular league takes too long
anyone want to chill in VC
i like salsa but only the water part i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want the vegetables so i just poke my chips at wet vegetables until they are dry
and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m currently out of salsa juice so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rly sad i have to eat my chips dry
but i dont
so close to being a vegetarian
jen doesnt eat salsa right and eat snickles
i only don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like their sausages
Only ppl who don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist like salsa juice
exactly, jen died after eating the snickle
No you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Because the walk back from work was horrible
I wanted a jolly milkshake üòî
i do it when i get food after work
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never tried any other flavor
but the thin mints never blend properly
so u get a thicc chunk of thin mint cookie soaked in icecream left at the bottom
They need to bring back the seasonal flavors
nutella isnt good
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry howdy üòî
But only for Real Shit
only brings pain and suffering
Gotta go work at jolly then
its cuz they arent university employees
as uni employeers we cant make 15
that might b workstudy tho
how does one even get hired tho
i've never seen a job ad
they were looking for ppl last semester
Yea they probably just held the same workers from last sem
i didnt grab jolly
if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m eligible for a work study
can i definitely have a job if i want one
like 75% say "work study only"
Once you have someone call u back it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s basically guaranteed
But you need someone to call u back lol
but if you work study, do the work for the monies
@eekhannah i think just dont send in the wrong resume
work study gang
god i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m terrified of going far away
or it might not matter idk
See I got my job through *Case Connections*√¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏ so I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything except email and got the job
it depends on the job, i didnt give a resume for utech, i got in a zoom call and they were like u seem cool
dont hate on the quad monitor setups
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m honestly scared of managing everything
u dont need a management job then
Like school n work n stuff?
how am i to do everything i need to do to get into med school and come out alive
O dang rip ur med student
The first half of last sem was horrid as I learned
2000/2750 applicant acceptance into opto school
college rly forces u to learn how to time manage and figure ur own shit out
With nursing we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re forced to but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think other majors have that chance
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be a neurosurgeon

I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know why but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still trying to get free summer housing to work over summer
dont even need a med school
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trust myself enough to be a surgeon i dont think
i wanted to be a surgeon but i am too squeamish lol
how hard could performing surgery even be smh
ez head stab
damn
you hate to see it
i talked with library staff, he says apparently every student he talked to "didn't have Case initially on their list"
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have case initially on my list
You guys have been active in the hour I wasn't logged in üòñ
Case was a tie for me, the tie breaker was that I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to stay near home lol
Didnt get in tho :(
damn
rip
my parents really wanted me to come here
My parents thought I would die if I went away from home
Jokes on them I died twice
shes literally going to ggeorgia tech which is p much on par with case if im not wrong like ?????
Howdy smh dying twice is an accomplishment
go to the school that gives u money
Case also gave me the most money and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still paying crazy monies
Would never catch me going below the mason dixon line
i used to live rlly near princeton
i live really close to brown
like 20 minutes away
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t paying the app fee for an ivy lmao
A friend of mine got rejected from the ivies but accepted into UCLA and was really bummed but like, that's still a great school?? I get it though.
i use a kanken because it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make my back hurt
Why would I intentionally injure a single shoulder when I can kill both at once?
im scared
it will be a ton of work
i dont want to die
i was going to be cs and then i decided that i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have enough experience
Depends on the major and profs n shit
i think a lot of people are blinded by prestige and won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like a school just because it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t considered a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtop 20√¢‚Ç¨ school
my major is so small case is trying to kill it :P
aparently they dont like people majoring in memeology
I agree. He was the type of kid who dreamed of going to Harvard or Stanford, so it was disappointing when he didn't get into either. But he would be just as successful at a state school. And there's literally nothing wrong with UCLA
just realized i shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that here for reasons whoops
like they rly dont mean anything
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into my √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdream√¢‚Ç¨ school and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fine
i just want to graduate, get a job, and not die of starvation
i got waitlisted at my 2nd and 3rd choices and now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m committing to case, and i never thought i would
apparently case committee did a study, they found Case has negative social life culture
survey in 2 weeks
that doesnt seem like accurate data then
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done it in forever
well, if u dont got rona, that should b a breeze
I honestly don't remember the last time I even jumped....
she's tried to get me to read it a million times
i like rollerblading though
My clinical instructor rollerblades to work lol
barriers: STOP GIVING ME HOMEWORK
I mean the thing is, most case students seem to be more introvert anyway, so if we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna do shit we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t no matter how many programs you make
i had a cold like a week before the shutdown
definitely wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rona though

Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call me after that

There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s many abandoned factories

i love vegan ice cream that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taste like shit
cleveland is nothing but abandoned places
tho i dunno how clean those are
also, i need a proper mug
but nothing to pour it in
I lied nvm I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not getting up for shit
Fuck ur copyright Minority Boy Communist Blood: the body is weak yet the mind is curious
i hate hpysics
I took my physics as an online class to finish my science graduation requirement, bad decision
if you hate phys, you'll never meet covault tho
"bad" decision?
OH MY god i want to meet him
Never have to take physics ever again üòé
Bad Bc it was hard
I trade my possibly physics knowledge for knowing which lung sounds mean ur dying
The ones that don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sound normal obv
oh man cpr
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s another thing i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m bad at
I will just steal the takis u didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat duh
bad motor skills go brrr
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t choke on ur takis then
because i get tired
i try to use my body weight but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a lot of body weight
i work on a neuro floor
If I manage to stay on campus and I miss my chance for that dope peds job I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going oncology
Just learned ab neuro assessment this week tho how fun
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing my physics homework rn
my physics teacher was absolutely terrible at physics
My physics teacher would literally copy homework answers off of mine and another student's answers
oh
"kill the masses" - my physics teacher
Learned more from him in a week than from my HS physics teacher in the whole year
my schools physics department isn't great either
lemme put it this way, the year before mine, he had an AP pass rate of 100% and he only had 2 4s, everything else was a 5
i mean thats not uncommon at my school but also college prep
this was a public school
my music theory teacher only had 1 person not pass the ap exam in 15 years of teaching the class
he'd bring a dart gun to school and if we answered a question wrong, he'd shoot us with it
if we were PARTICULARLY stupid with our answer, he'd use a water gun instead
damn
aren't darts pointy objects?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting a 2 on my ap physics exam because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know electromagnetism
i never had the pleasure of being shot
oh nerf guns
jen i'm disappointed
my school doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have phys c
shut the fuck up rn üòê
Isn't it called AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism though?
don't remember
my school doesn't have it which is really annoying
may 25 i take my ap physics exam
I cant wait to graduate and go work this summer
I got a 1 on the AP Environmental one last year :cri:
Bruh I suck at English APs
i wanted to take ap environmental
fuck da college board
because my school just started offering it but it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t run
For my AP Language exam my essay topic was "What is overrated?"
fuck the college board
I do not think it is worth, though that is because my teacher sucks
wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t popular enough
I wanted to write about AP and College Board but I decided against it
a kid at my school got the same prompt and wrote her essay on them
i had an old teacher that used to grade ap exams
no ap lang at my school
i hate history
them fuckers so stupid
i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken bc if it was offered
Second dose and I feel like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dying
Ok just body pain
Rly bad
i had chills and a fever
Imagine having AP classes, couldn't be our school ü§°
he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not my teacher anymore because he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the dean of students now but he has to be my ap instructor and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrible
our college counselors consistently lowball people's expectations that aren't like the top 1% of the class
I was the top 1% and they were mad I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to ivies
I have rly bad adhd and I only just found out
i wrote my common app essay about how i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consider myself smart until 10th grade because it took me a lil longer to learn to read
LMAO I COULDNT READ FOR SO LONG
Happened w my brother too
my school tried to kick me out back in like 1st grade because aspie, but my parents were not happy with that
isn't school required
and then i went on to leave that place better than I found it
Same. I was told I shouldn't expect to even get in...
Idk how I feel abt case
my college counselors told me it was a bit of a reach, meanwhile i got into literally every school they told me was a reach
fuck them.
are you gonna come though?
College counselors are pathological liars
I should have dual enrolled at jcu and they told me not to Bc they wanted to push the Ivy League agenda
i greatly overestimated my college capabilities
case just seems so much more chill than all the other schools I looked at at this tier
well thats cuz the unchill ppl are too busy partying or studying to b on discord
honestly surprised i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get hard rejected from all of the ivies i applied to
This years college process was so weird
Honestly, the only reason I was probably accepted into a lottery was because of my ethnicity. I am not qualified for that at all. I hate how college admissions have an agenda to push
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gay
i wrote about being jewish w/o realizing that thats √¢‚Ç¨≈ìworse√¢‚Ç¨ than being white in college admissions bc model minority üëçüëç
this kinda sucks, ngl
liquids and pc
i wrote about how tw??||studying the holocaust helps me connect to the family i never got to know|| ig
shame
My grandpas a Holocaust survivor and it feels surreal that I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be around if he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t survive
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I wrote a supp for case
and the reason many apply here
Did for other colleges tho but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhy do u want this major√¢‚Ç¨
Jokes on them I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want this lajor
Maybe that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give me money üòî
I feel. Mine was about baking...
Bob do u want me to withdraw from CWRU
Simple shit
last ones i wrote too
nah woodworking, close enough
I miss woodworking
i joined a shop class for wood working
but damn case' woodshop is ancient
like, the table saw doesnt have any safety on it what so ever
doesn't thinkbox have a nice one?
Alright I'm going to go sleep early bc I have a physics exam tomorrow, gn everyone
damn bro
i forgot it lol
Math is fake anyway
College is fake
aren't you bi-yourself?
I got this stupid cat during the pandemic and now he has separation anxiety
it don't
i got my cat before my freshman year of high school and now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared to leave him
i am not bi myself anymore but I probably will be soon
fuck physics
he gets upset when my schedule changes i cannot imagine how he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll feel when i leave for several months at a time
death
like a ten hour drive
oh
so not bad at all
Pain
i'm about an 8 hour drive
pain peko
I live ten mins away ü§°
10 minutes is a long drive where i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m from
want me to walk you through it?
I hate those
teamwork makes the dream work
i got everything i need right around me
Then you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll hate case
I had to drive like half an hour to get to school
Nope
why does everyone attending case seem to hate case
Nah i dont hate it
I love hate it
i feel this is relevant
Bc as an Inner City Youth√¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏√¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏√¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏ going from chi to Cleveland fucking suckkeddd
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing fun around
my mom has lived in rhode island for 57 years this woman is going to lose her mind in a car for 10 hours
They have so much shit

Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink trust me
When I went for my sad ass √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbirthday√¢‚Ç¨ last semester it was packed and very little ppl had masks
depends on where you go idk
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to be studying for my CNA
uh oh

I wish to go back home, where the homies r

I wish to go back to my creator
50 isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fast enough
AKSJAISHAH IM SO SCARED WALKING HERE IN EVENING
lol, I don't leave my house at night, like ever
man yall come from dangerous places apparently
Not a real place if there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t danger spots
i've never had the displeasure of getting mugged
Depends on the school
I want to pepper spray a bitch
I've never been in a fight
but idk why
Oh rlly??
I mean some ppl feel safer w personal defense items so
part of why I was a pack rat in HS, i packed my backpack with so much so you can't get through it with a knife
i dont think so lmao
I think people are scared of me because i'm kinda a big dude (like 5'11", 180lb muscle) and because i have aspergers so i'm terrible at talking to them
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a college campus
you can have pepper spray, but you also can't overdo it when using it in terms of legality
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an asshole but It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help
what am i going to do w/ my orbital death lazer then?
But if someone uses pepper spray they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get arrested lol
after hitting someone in the eye with it, you go back and do it again
i've been catcalled, that was fucking weird
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pepper spray regardless u are doing a bad burn
LA is so stupid
fair
This is a United States hate page
idk if id rather have pepper spray or a taser
I want a pink gun so badly
bc on one hand u have the range w pepper spray on the other hand i feel like a taser is more likely to help u
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a knife gonna do without knife proficiency lol
and i was very scared
Lol as if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll do shit
Spray has the longest range, Knife is second, followed by the taser, but the knife doesn't work as well because it's not an immediate disable like the other two
Spray has the longest range, Knife is second, followed by the taser, but the knife doesn't work as well because it's not an immediate disable like the other two. I personally prefer the taser though
knife got style points tho
never had a gun, never handled a gun
don't want to
it's empowering and terrifying in the same way driving a car is
like you know if you fuck up you could kill someone
ok yea but a car serves another purpose than to kill something lmao
when i was babi i though pellet guns were pellican guns, cuz the dude i was with had an accent
i need to somehow learn to drive
and i really wanted to see a pelican come out
i kind of want to learn to snipe tho. become the best eye doctor

i want to work a lot this summer and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like to be able to drive myself to work lol

But my heart area is sore
I got pretty bad insomnia

u dont know what ur delt is üòê
Why would anyone kno where their deltoid is, unless they do anp or work out
i feel like its relatively common knowledge
Idek how to work it out
well meg, i dont have any abs, so i cant call them a muscle
i hate it when im at wyant, and u got these average joes lifting weight machines and slamming them back down after like 7 reps
nope regular looking people
people do 1 set then whip out their phone for 5 minutes
I want to do climbing üòî
simply do not work
u just cant
Climbing is so scary
I mean wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t b proficient enough to do it without the ropes or whatever
So I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t die
The upperclassmen haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t humbled him yet
yea I will just stick to bouldering, though big wall stuff looks dope
I hate having ibs

Ya that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I left my card at home

the only thing I really spend money on is food
simply, get another job
stupid college tuition

gardasil hurt
It hurt me idk why
I only want to be a doctor or nurse so I can know this shit
The key to learning is learning from where the people who are doing the shit are learning from
Learning from the studying sources of the people learning to do the thing professionally
oh
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just been 2x speeding her head to toe assessment for the final test out
we never tested out on head to toes lmao
even then tho a focused neuro takes less than 5 min
if theyre not a 15 something is wrong
except for rob rob already judged
what is wrong with girl kissing girl why is that a sin
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know they had genders XD, and was obviously joking. A bold word to throw out just saying
handholding is the worst
idk rob is a rob
~~rob shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have called my lesbian stuffed animals sinners~~
aw come on we can't have respectful, informative discussion?
kissing is never a sin. no matter what :Culture:
*shakes ass sadly*
rip plant
i'm getting a plant in my room and naming him robert plant
It pains me to say it but can we restrict the bob-ing in general? it hurts annie's soul
i wasnt aware it hurt annie's soul
she keeps yelling at me to restrict bob but i'm a horrible parent
he can never be restricted...
he already doesn't make dad jokes in general
I got emailed by one and wanted to know if it was customary for that to occur
why does hulu have fucking ads stop showing me ads i will not watch them
Uh as a joke, I literally didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know they had genders even. Idk I guess it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t clear.
Bro I literally didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know there was anything gay there, even if there was I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care. I literally said they look super cute lol
dont take anything i say seriously
Thought you were serious and it kinda scared me üëÄ like ah shit what now
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sit well when a human right activist gets marked homophobic

im tired
Samee I woke up at like 8:20am and now its 3am the next day and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m like dead at this point
I got 2 exams in 5 hours which I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not prepped for so oof
ive never used it but my friends have
rob this made me want to pass away
How much are u guys trying in school rn
I'm not trying at all
My grades won't get lower than a low A so I'll be fine
Ok why do my AP classes have final exams I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna kms
Like we already have to take the AP test why are teachers giving us a final exam
I hate it here
I have to write an essay for AP Chem, but otherwise I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about classes
Seniors don't have finals at my school
Unless they are taking college classes
because some of my classes had 2 finals
for example, my lit class had 2 finals
My chem, calc, and choir classes all have finals.
Choir finals?
@hucklebuttcheeks I had my final a week ago
Oh ap
I have an AP bio final this Tuesday and Wednesday and I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t studied yet
Time to shit it
They shouldn't even grade it for pts @hucklebuttcheeks
It should be diagnostic tho
it was some class' attempts at killing senioritis
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the only test that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna be on quarter 4, so if I fail it, then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna fail this quarter poggers
Rip
We are just starting the evolution unit @hucklebuttcheeks
God I wish that were me

i was dying of laughter
im just worried about hurting case√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s feelings if i get in off a waitlist early
case is an institution, there won't be any feelings to hurt :nkosip:
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have a deposit so there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing for ME to lose
no school does
if you get someone you'd rather b
damn now i gotta withdraw from another school
you got till may 1st tho
dunk on them with the "After a careful review of your offer, I am unfortunately unable to accept admission to your institution.."
the problem is i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bookmark the portal
the problem is two of the schools i declined didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even acknowledge that i declined and they just keep sending emails
i already did. sorry
rip
unsub all them college emails
y'all didnt make a dummy email for college and it shows
just declined my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s school feeling good
before i realized i had sold my soul to collegeboard
another school already locked me out of the portal lol
i tried to log in and it says Access Denied
okay actually i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t break up with one of the schools
mainly because there are a lot of steps to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìconfirm your enrollment√¢‚Ç¨ and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to accidentally commit to the most expensive school i have
@everybody Jen keeps mocking my tremor tell her to stop üòî
i told them straight up why i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not attending their school because they told me to give a reason
Yes. They are. And it's ridiculous. My school won't allow in person tests, but collegeboard isn't reducing the price for online testing. So it's $95 per subject for a test that isn't even physical. F that, man. They're so scammy.
I'm not taking them this year. I'm not prepared
simply dont take ap's
the parents at my school all just started complaining until the school offered in person AP tests
I wish the parents at my school would bully the district into getting what they wanted
how does that work,,, because some tests require on paper, in person no matter what
idk if this is just a my school thing
but i paid $50ish for each exam which is still a significant burden for my family
boycott college board
college board execs dont get paid
i didnt give college board a single cent
cuz ap classes are too big brain for my smol brain
but the college board makes you have a card?? like i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even think my school gives out cards
just don't take the test
and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like the college board DOESNT have my financial information
just dont take ap classes
that sucks
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to half ass my physics exam
just spam this on the exam
i hate the concept of that test
u need to work on ur formatting
psych, calc, and lit are the ones i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not worried about
my school doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t offer bc
FUCK
we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re on 7 and my brain went to the store to get some milk halfway through unit 6
unit 7 actually isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad tbh
Legit never did those, not even Calc BC
you will absolutely HATE them in diff eq
Couldn't be me
Stop trying to hide the yam from the public
the yam ate the stop sign and that's why yamate means stop
they dont like u
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like myself even
You didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss much
555 - AAA - FUCK
no I rly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I have a huge final in mechanics and I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done anything for that class all year Bc he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rly give grades
Every time I try to study I have a mental breakdown
And it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like I was being lazy I was so busy trying to understand e and m that I had no time for mechanics and the no test situation led me to not prioritize it
if you need help with calc i can help you
Dawg I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even tell u
Like I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to even graduate
nooo you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t an embarrassment
I fucking hate my classmates
(I hate both sides don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come after me)
To the point where I am going to leave my AP test blank
Just push through until the end of the year
The most important part is finding the will in yourself to do your stuff, it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter how smart or dumb you are then as long as you can do it
Well I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so burned out on another level
And even doing it for others is not cutting it anymore
Like I do the homework and stuff
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just exhausted
I went from being a close to 5.0 student to almost failing a class
Idek anymore
Probably just that one class
I just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learn a half year of material in a week
Let your other grades go to shit, like get C√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and low B√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, and then focus all your energy in pulling that Calc grade
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m working on finishing my missing assignments rn
And ngl, working on missing assignments has helped me study for stuff I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give up though
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give up :( make take a little break but i still think you can come back from this!!!
@pinkfluffyunicorn999 LMK if you want some help. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m allegedly already carrying some of my classmates in multi calc and calc phys
Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just trying to get a medical certification and doing school at the same time and sometimes I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have time for school and at this point it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also hard to care
physics is my worst class rn
Physics 1 and Calc BC was awfully rough for me last year too to the point where I had mental breakdowns over those classes periodically
So I guess my point is you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not alone, take a deep breath, and just do your best
Calc isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad for me, but physics is some scum of the earth coursework
Mine is so bad
My bf has taken college ohysics and he was like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure this man is speaking English
No one understands shit
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even taken classes at case and already have depression
Idk I just hate the classes I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking rn and they are taught so badly
Life is pain
I hate those people
So annoying
"Huur durr bro Im gonna fail lol and get a 98 instead of 100 im so stupid and funny haha lol"
"im gonna fail, im only getting 100 instead of 106 KILL ME IM SO STUPID"
getting above a 100 in college classes is impossible
my classes give extra credit points on exams for like if they take away questions bc a certain % got them wrong
but if u get it right u still get credit for it
ok fair
says the man who got over 100
Do they still ever do multiple choice? The whole concept i never rly understood
there was some multichoice due to rona
but they like their short answer questions
i assume math and phys
Idk in general
prob depends on the class
sages: essays, and sentences *ew*
math: answering questions (was multi choice due to rona)
phys: answer question with a 10million answer written response (for some fucking reason)
chem: just no
kinda hard to have mc with math if ur trying to see if a student understanda
meg, dont u know "nursing isnt a real major"
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably just used for grading convenience huh? Otherwise why leave it up to chance when testing if they know the concept
mc is nice tho, cuz small brains can atleast guess, vs writing nothing
math and physics generally won't be multiple choice
for example, the quizzes for stat 312 this year were all short answer
but the exams were multiple choice
i went thru a hollow knight phase
Idk how it works tho lol, is it a webinar or are people gonna see my face?
hmm idk
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll find out in 5 minutes üòÇ

I wish I knew, I got a merit scholarship with 0 idea what the requirements are to maintain it all 4 years
Also I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never even graduate if I took less than 12 credits a semester.
College is supposed to be harder tho üëÄ

that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
have you ever seen a flat earther speak you can feel them physically restraining themselves from saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe Jews√¢‚Ç¨ in like every sentence
well thats cuz if you believe in flat earth, you believe in atleast 10 other worse ones
but alone, flat earth is, earth is flat, nasa hacking ur eyeballs and editing pictures
qanon was a 4chin troll that so many people ate its hilarious
no like the community makes videos about him calling him stupid
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìnot to sound like I hate Jewish people but Jewish people are the evil dark shadow masters pulling the strings of the conspiratory machine and also they are all pedophiles√¢‚Ç¨ - flat earthers

Idk how to use discord, how do I summon Bob
my computer is fixed üò∫
OH
when that green bitch died
Oh my
tbh I'm about to die from another boring week of work
me too tho
CAH Game expired, too long without any actions or no players.
might try that after class or something idk
aww
someone keeps giving you the role and then removing it
the elevator doors travel randomly without anyone requesting them
I miss shopping mall trips. Now all the good old places are closed üòî
uh oh
sorry its just me
oh shit
okay I need to be productive now
aww we can play cards against humanity
aww
She could probably play better than I can still
I'm definitively the worst person at playing chess in my grade
oh no
just don't give the bot admin
he doesn't have admin
sorry i just like its plumpness lol
what the fuck
In a half mile long line for the vaccine
bill gates microchipped himself what a fucking idiot am I right
Update: still on line
It's been an hour and twenty minutes
damn
i feel like we should be doing things
i have calculated that i will end this quarter with an A- in physics
at one point in my life i wanted to major in physics
Nah I just didn't connect you with Insta lol
Still have not processed thar
I empathize. I'm in a never ending search for the cheapest shampoo
wrong on both accounts
shut up anie the world doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t revolve around pst
except we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re in EDT rn
omg which vaccine
couldn't think of something that rhymes with J&J
bc of a blood clotting issue
apparently someone died
oh damn
moderna and pfizer are where it's at because they like work
guess i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m cancelling my appointment
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to die ü•∂
it seems to be more prevalent in women but honestly like its only 20-30 people out of millions
astra is causing problems
i also heard that j&j has worse side effects and welp like yall said they have to withdraw their vaccine temporarily
A person from my high school was hospitalized in the ICU for blood clots in the lungs
Last week was a bad week for our high school: one had a stroke and the other had pulmonary embolism
yikes, that is terrible
I wouldn't take J&J even if I had the opportunity tho
Just because of it slow rate of success/protectiveness
Even just one shot from Moderna or Pfizer still has a higher rate than J&J
not to butt in on an argument that happened way earlier today but @fwoggywaffles there is a diff between "sketchy management" and "we fund gay conversion therapy"
and also just because they said they wouldnt do it again doesnt mean their money isnt now going somewhere else that is also horrifying
oh sorry i was just testing something
seems sus
ZACC HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES
i know i know he won't reply in general anymore
honestly if u just dont make him an admin it will be way the fuck easier to control where he goes
you can assign his role to only be able to go certain places
gone long
oh I thought he was a mod
oh
I mean it should be fine as long as case doesn't find out
idk what's hapenning with it but they had a big stage and stuff
yea i have never been on board with bobbot :cursedimage:
yeah i didnt know that was a thing
why doesn't the staff have a vote on it?
idk üò≠
rip
There are far more common practices that cause blood clots, but the shifting factor is the amount of media attention. For instance, the odds of a blood clot forming form this is about 7 in 7 million, versus 10x more likely that you'll get a cervical artery dissection and subsequent stroke from a chiropractor
scary
it's the existential fear of the sudden brain aneurysm i guess
An AAD feels like your soul is tearing in two as the largest vessel in your body splits down the middle and releases all of your blood
im siding with zach on this one tho i dont want to know that im dying as im dying
oh dear
ALS is what I can think of being the worst possible death
sadly, dead
sadly, dead.
scary big words :(
It's called "Brain on Fire disease"  because even though your brain has no nerve endings, it can generate sensations
I unfortunately have committed to another school
Sorry to betray the bob clan
there's a couple of indian places near campus
litrally didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know he died but rip :(
Fuck...
And then I have a calc test right after it holy fuck
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need both of my asscheeks slapped
My school banned kahoot when one of the students named themselves the n-word üòÇ
We aren't allowed to use any multiplayer quizzing programs
Though we've secretly been doing Gimkit
You earn money with each right answer, and you can spend that money to make each right answer pay more
i have to study for a history test i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to tho
apparently
@ishikak892 needs to yell at us
DON'T PROCRASTINATE
Too late I'm already ready to get a zero on my APUSh homework
I've been straight typing up pages of work for that class daily
GO STUDY
Bruh them teachers cant take my acceptance away if I don't get an A
The apush curriculum has gone through a lot of bad changes
There's the 1619 project trying to bring up overtly false claims, and on the far other end of the spectrum there's Trump lol
i need all the nko emotes
I'm tired lemme take a nap then I'll consider it
Really feeling motivated to get my work done when it doesn't matter much
I feel like senioritis was worse this year with everything online.
im too tired to take a nap
i think its fun cuz its like an incentive to keep working
taking history notess
i can never study on discord vc
What homework is it
im just studying
you just need to pass apush at this point
im not even kidding rn
yeah that was not me last year
i know but i wanna get a 95 overall average still and apush is my worst grade
but i need it to stay like that
~~i won't even mention my lowest grade i got senior year~~
9th grade i did bad
can i really flex rn
idk how im doing this well but i need it to stay this way
Actually, I've done badly in every grade, just worse this year because of senioritis
I'm trying to type up my 5 page AP chem essay but every cell of my body is hating it
~~im behind in lectures doe~~
The history tho not the science
aw
you cant cancel if it we cancel it instead
RIP bobbot
damn
dumb that they stopped j&j vaccine bc of 6 people. people are twice as likely to get struck by lightening than get the blood clot those people did.
yeah i feel that way too
theres lots of other medicines that are fine with a much higher rate of clotting, but at the same time i guess since its new they want to mmake sure it wont do anything else
ye and since it also only accounts for 3% of the total vaccinations won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t affect vaccination speed too badly
And it's probably better to not dish out vaccines that could possibly cause harm (no matter how small the chance), given how desperate some people are to find any reason to not take the vaccine
But I mean at least there is still pfizer and moderna in circulation
I paid nothing
I had to volunteerr for it tho
i miss bob
I miss bob more
my life is no longer meaningful
Pain
Now all I got from the vaccine was a sore arm and strange voices in my head that sound a lot like Bill Gates
this has been my worst academic quarter since freshman year that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just how it is sometimes
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually not *that* bad but there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s certainly a difference
one of the schools is my dream school i gotta give it a shot üòîüòî
oh oop then gl with that school!
banana phone
dontnana phone
i've got this feeling
I'm sure they're easy if you want to fail üòé
neck pain neck pain neck pain neck pain
ouch
I feel there are more resources here for support than other universities I feel at least
But every school is hard for engineering and premed in general
The issue is that professors expect students to put in a lot of hours each week into each class
I know a sophomore who just told me he's taking graduate level math classes
I am not that smart, but I do work hard üòÇ
He's double majoring in CS and math
I'm not smart enough to do graduate level math classes until maybe my fourth year
I feel like I would struggle in calc 3 my first semester because I am adjusting idk üôÉ
Yeah need as much gpa points as I can get üòÖ
I guess, but I don't think I have mastery like I should
And I feel it's ok to take intro classes too!!
yeahh maybe one or two intro classes would help me get adjusted to the style of college classes especially since i'm an international student
I moved from California to India when I was 4 and I've lived here since
aw is bob bot dead
i have to wear a clear mask for drama and i hate it so much
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just really uncomfortable
@rhysarsenal im trying to do CS and business at the same time but seems like its gonna be tough haha
1/2 the size for 2 ppl still?
I would never want to live on the first floor. Always have to keep the blinds closed unless you want everyone to be able to see you
I'll still have one year of mandatory on-campus living though
Once I'm an upperclassman, I'll get some friends to rent a place with me and save a ton of money and live how I want
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember

how did they get the funding to pay every kid 30$ to get a vax that everyone already wants?
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get that till like the thursday after next
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cuz of my job, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an incentive to get vaccinated and if you do you get 2 hours pto
i want a kitkat now

so sad
so sad
working at ksl rn

i dont normally do coffee places but that's cuz i did not spend a lot of time here
we have a lot of tims branches in my area tho

I've never seen a lawyer turn down money
im leaving in 7 minutes to get vaccinated
im terrified of needles still
i just am scared of needles
its gonna hurt and im gonna cry
........... um idk

pfizer turned my nerves into electrical wires
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to get a new appointment for pfizer or moderna

trying desperately to find a red velvet gif that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make me look like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not following the topic of conversation
now something looks extra wrong with me
still not work
I feel like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m cursed
oh dear god
i hate this gif
apparently there also exists popcorn crepe cake
never seen a cake that large
never been with anyone who offered me that big of a cake
saw this without context
wtf
sigh
i cant open my mouth wide enough for that
you either have a large mouth or a small fist
see Jen wants a smaller cake
i want my jaw to stop being broken
i want a phat ass annie is wrong
prefer a cake that won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trigger my gag reflex
i hate it here
i really wanna do it
dont
dont u dare
it feels like trying to tell a dog not to lick a gallon jug of milk
I was supposed to be in that ü•≤
jenin this world is full of gross people so people will decide to be disgusting sadly
it was not this bad last semester
idk what happened to people over winter break
oh shit I thought I was muted because of #muted chat lol
This doesn't really have any water because the group of people change every year. This is also the first year cutter has ever been a Case dorm, as it was just purchased from CIM
you want the link?
and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally like 1/5 of a mile away from my house
i still have the j&j role
or do I need both to get it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking my expired permit to walgreens to get vaccinated i hope i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get turned away
I dont think he ever set up the bot
i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be pfizer poggers if they decide to turn me away for my limited learner permit that expired six months ago
it needs to be state issued
I think you are fine as long as you don't try to drive there yourself
but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d probably get hit by a car
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve walked to that walgreens before but i almost got hit by a car
but no worries my dad can drive me üëç
if he decides to complain about driving 2 seconds away on his day off he can complain about his youngest child being hit by a car trying to get vaccinated üëç
case doesnt admit tall ppl
havent you seen the post
we dont make the rules
girl you dont have a current ID
I'm 6'1 and there was this mf who was 6'10 also named Zach in my OL group and he called me little Zach the entire time and I wanted fork socket
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drive
we dont make the rules
sorry jen, if ur here, you've been lied too
We need to cut tall people
Tallest person I had last year was 6'7
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll leave it up to interpretation
remove tall people's shins and donate to the poor
There's a procedure where they insert an IV directly into the central canal of your tibia and it's fucking metal
As a short boy, we need to get rid of tall people asap
isn't there like an artery there?
Idk I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t alive then
eyo wtf
Zach wtf?
maybe i shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go into the medical field
i hate writing letters of continued interest i sound like a simp
just dont
Height really isn't that big of a deal. Think about all of the cancer risk that you don't have by being short.
Imagine that shit without anesthesia, like an ER procedure, of a drill putting a like 18 gauge needle directly into your shin

scary stuff

wish me mum would allow me to get tattoos
i told myself i would get a tattoo on my 18th birthday but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been 6 months and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still tattoo less

it hurt a lot
its no shin tho
its ok my mom doesnt know abt it
ear is blobby flesh, without feely things, and no muscles
wrong
ear is not blobby and it feels
I am stuck because the commonly used medical symbol, the Caduceus, is wrong. The Rod of Asclepius is the right symbol. But the issue is that the Caduceus looks so much cooler
So do I be cool and wrong or lame and right

i was going to get a dragonfly on my arm for my late grandmother
my sister did that though
I would want the rod/caduceus on the palm side of my left forearm

actual driving should not be bad if u know how to drive
im a great driver and im still pissed bc the DMV lady failed me for not stopping on an UNMARKED STOP with NO SIGN or LINES ON THE ROAD which means that LEGALLY I WAS IN THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT
im fuckinG SALTY about it
im literally an expert at driving but to b e fair that is in comparison to other valley girls
i suck at driving
joke's on you we dont have kmart in the valley
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t kmart go out of business
what the fuck
do yoiu want AM or FM
I didn't realize that before
theyre literally terrible cars
teslas are great bc the seats hurt, there are no cupholders anywhere, no consideration is taken for passengers
nah i mean like as in the fucking interior design
Idk
no consideration of other passengers in the car because the driver is obviously the only important one
*cuz driving a tesla*
having a car? kinda cring
I have a car technically
I hate
that includes in the SUV which is geared towards families it doesnt have back seat cupholders and the seats are literally like antithetical to childrens car seats
DOn"T TALK ABOUT IT
IT CAN"T BE REAL
i dont have a car because imagine giving a car to someone who is going to move away literally a year later
i have an imaginary car
I've been saving up to buy a car and my dad "surprised" me with a 2009 used Smart Car
I will die
It has 70 damn horsepower
not jenin hovering down the street in a sitting position like sorry they forgot to render my honda civic
i never said i ride my car
zach just wants to fit in w/ case pd
It's so bad
cuz my car is using that space
death
how does it feel emotionally to drive a car that looks and controls like it was built in ikea
I have never driven it
is it a 2 person car did he get it to prevent u from having a social life
zach's dream car
in my two person sadness car
without the logo
same lame grey coloring
it looks like the popemobile trying to go incognito

That's an edited smart car in that gif

I have a smart car

tbh i generally feel better about the workload
cuz i've accepted that imma fail
idc about grades anymore
If I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pre med I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve given up much earlier
Idk
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything anymore
Sadly it does√¢≈ì≈í√Ø¬∏ü•≤
but don't kill yourself for it either :cat_heart:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just trying as hard as I can
30 mins for sages
Bye jenin
I should√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken a gap year
if I took a gap year I would have lost whatever remained of my sanity
I would have taken a gap year and slept the entire time
u also wouldnt b babi anymore, you'd just b young 2025
tru tho
no, still young, raunak is babi
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all are slow
Wishing her 11 years in advance?
I'm sorry I wasn't late to say happy birthday
sad
i did not get it

My laptop was dead and Rock 301 doesn't have outlets so I just sat with an open, off laptop and listened to lecture today
@.bugcatcapoo why can u send messages in quotes with no timer but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t üôÉ
the problem is the police will still pull u over and if you point out that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re enforcing a void speed marker then they will get mad at you for disobeying them
i don't think that JapanCase is doing anything for that
Can you get lost?
He didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t roast me lol what
dead tired, but that's just par the course
after slaving for 5 hours
Oh no I would never. I love her √¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏
huh u tried leutner milk dispenser?
but the milk doesn't pour outta the machine
anyways time to go to sleep at a healthy hour
ok i give up
too hard to be woke
I don't even have a sleep schedule anymore
same. my sleep schedule is no longer a schedule. its a freestyle
who i said called case a bad school
sorry dont remember
yeah i didnt expect it from u anyway üôÑ
nothing
mmm looks like Katniss here lost her bow
HAHA FUNN Y HUNGRY!! GAMES!   CUZ ACTRESS!!!
Gale really dodged a bullet here
what the fuck does this even mean
why do you keep relating me to maternal figures i dont like it
I stopped going on here for two weeks and suddenly there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 200 newbies
Really hope correlation isn't causation
last thing i want to do when I'm having fun is think about how people are better than me
leave jen alone zacc
that was the moral i was trying to impart
don't drag dr. jeff into it though
oh
Rip
short essay
But that is still fax
what ever happened to yesbel
like what happened to him
u scared them all away moses
moses left and it PARTED
Do physics homework pls
I was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwho the fuck is Yesbel do they mean Isabel√¢‚Ç¨
I took Calc 3 and thought I had vectors figured out and then I took Linear Algebra and realized I knew nothing about vectors
Now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just scared
last resort i switch to exon
The money will be my sole driving force
Cuz potato _gratin_
oh i thought
Wtf why did I not think of that
Nothing gives me more joy than having 0 unread messages in my inbox
i stopped bothering with emails one week after we started 2nd semester
altho i used to keep my inbox at 0
no i just don't open unimportant emails
Crap why did it take the whole screen
oh
On the plus side, 2 professors emailed me back about research today; one said no, the other one said yes but didn't elaborate
oh gotcha
When I was parking at my school, I accidentally bumped into another car and dented it. Thought I'd go to class (I was about to be late) and then come back about an hour later to leave a note with my number. I come back and the dent on that car is completely gone
Like wtf
never used the plunger technique b4?
As everyone carries a plunger in their car
You're not wrong there. Though if it was a student's car (it probably was), then he couldn'tve gotten a plunger because all of the students were occupied with a school-wide meeting (our school is fairly small)
oh really
they cant pile up
if they dont exist
I recently turned on sound notifications so I get a sound whenever someone sends me an email, responds to me on Discord, or someone posts something on GroupMe
has anyone thought about using the survival skills they picked up growing up in rural north carolina around a bunch of preppers, farmers, and ex SEALs to abandon society and become a hermit living in the appalachian mountains instead of going to case to study electrical engineering
you seem to be missing the point of becoming a hermit
my previous statement was a joke, but seriously though, does anyone else think about just completely removing themselves from society
Honestly, if my parents didn't invest a ton of effort and money into me already, I'd seriously consider it
But because they spent time raising me, I'm definitely more interested in being a productive member of society than a hermit. Idk if that makes sense but that's my logic.
I'm okay, this Data Structures homework is tough but once I submit it on Thursday night I should be fine until finals
damn my shoulder hurts
Next semester is going to be really weird for me, one professor reportedly made a girl cry during a lecture and another one assigned like 200 homework questions simultaneously
guys we have 4 weeks left
my exams be on the very last days
I'm so confused as to why the first half of this semester was vibes and the last half has just been existential screaming
i started screaming the third week :xcrittyxspeed: what half
Im gonna cry would case rescind for an f
I already have so much science credits I just cannot emotionally do this
Our teacher hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done shit all year and expects us to do well on a full on final
Is it just a pass or fail sort of exam? I doubt you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d do too bad if it was on a regular scale
What class and also since it is the pandemic I think they would understand
an F on a test isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going to bring your grade down to an F overall unless you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re at a low D- or already have an F
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not going to care about individual test scores and you can probably make a case for yourself if you have a failing grade in a class and weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t already given conditional enrollment
exams 3 over
thats so weird tho
Screw snowmen, I remember building an entire snow CAVE with my dad after a particularly bad storm
If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re cold, just add layers. Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do the opposite too many times though
global warming says no u to snow forts tho
School was cancelled for like a whole week
It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even bad snow. Just that TX people have a seizure when they see a single snowflake
yea, wasnt it like a light dusting
It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even enough for snowballs until the last day
damn
The winter storm in Texas in February was really bad
texas was not prepared which made things bad :wobble:
I lost power for 3 days and professors offered to let me turn in my homework late and one offered to let me delay taking an exam
Really bad for Texans. In the grand scheme of snowstorms though it  was pretty weak
I suppose I was pretty lucky though as I only lost hot water while my friends and teachers lost power as well.
So basically if I fail this I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to fail the semester
Because my teacher was stupid and never graded anything or gave tests but then decided to give a final
Is that even allowed? I know a teacher at my school was fired because he wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t inputting the minimum of 2 graded assignments for week, among other issues.
Either way, its not your fault, and as long as you can still graduate on time you should be fine imo
just don't get worse than like a C
want you to eat chapstick
i once tried eating henna
sorry i was copying my friend and realized i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want that pfp
So my brain is broken, correct
> falling asleep on a luggage cart while my sister ate Mike.
Damn
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a child though
zach go sleep
i think u need it
my sister is like 2 1/2 years older than me and she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look that much older than me there
sigh
my tummy hurt
Someone √¢‚Ç¨Àús alarm going off annoying:)))
Still?!?
Oh!
The end of this episode ends with the penguin laying an egg :thonk: :thonk: :weirdchamp:
Couldn't be me
imagine not being able to get a vaccine
am working ksl 6-10 tonight
but theres nothing to do
study instead of slacking :cat_gun:
huh i can't find that emote
its too late
~~guns work better fyi~~
omg someone get a doctor
my arm is starting to hurt from the vaccine :PES_Cry:
rip
Not quite, I stayed up until 4:30 AM to do Discrete Math homework so I only got like 3 hours of sleep but I feel fine right now
I planned badly and almost forgot about one homework assignment... otherwise, I wouldn't have had to stay up so late
regardless of work
i went to bed early
and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do my work
and it turned out ok
we still need to watch that movie :wobble: classes take time
how else would you cut something
Homework is 20 percent of the grade which is almost as much as one of the midterms
ateveryone it's past 11 go sleep
@_the_intern_ shame on you
bruh i dont even know what u look like
omg
Kylie didn't come in today
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so bad I got a cat and a job as a nurse assistant so I have a will to live
i cant tell if thats a meme cat or something cause its just sitting on the stairs like a human
went to corbo today
oh?
gone now
omg
its just emote spam tho :thonk:
There's a chance we saw each other at the tour if you were there 3ish
I was dead for about a day when I got my second shot lmao
just got mine too
yea i took it on friday and was dead saturday
it's less today but it's still there
I'm worried that if I get Moderna/Pfizer right now then I'll get a second dose right in the middle of finals week (probably going to be one of the busiest weeks of my life) and then I'll lose an entire day
on this boring day off
didnt spongebob say that
idk lol
my mom was out gardening today as if she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even get the shot yesterday. I was basically bedridden for an entire day üòÇüò≠üòÇ
one thing tho
apparently pfizer will need booster shots and moderna won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Yearly boosters are likely going to become normal just the same as flu shots. Sars coV 2 isn't going anywhere
my mom doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let us get the flu shot
no bc she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they work
The only serious side effect from a vaccine is Guillen Barre syndrome and you have to have genetic predisposition and incredible odds against you
thats why at the flu clinic we have to screen u if uve ever had gbs!!
I was wondering why I never heard of this Patio app. Just checked and there are only 1-10k downloads on the Play Store
update i failed the test bc of this :giggles:
God Physics Is SO bOring
my teacher standing at the top of class lik *e hehemwemewemgmngmgngmgnmgngmmegm* im like what does that have to do with math
true physics do be boring
especially today bc my classes are 20 mins üò≠ like wtf we supposed to do in that time
wtf 20??
i love physics i hate
i hate
this class
hate it
WTF
i hate physics i hate my teacher so much he is awful
Normally they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re 80 mins
there was a time when i wanted to major in physics
not anymore
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already decided i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to bomb my ap exams it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fine
I dropped my AP psych exam lol
nobody needs to know
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t payed attention once in psych and somehow have 100% both semesters this class is a joke at my school lmao
the ones highlighted are my exams
Calc AB AP test isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad
I found it slightly enjoyable last year
everyone in ap lit is taking the exam
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think my school is doing any in school tests for AP
Wtf is that pacing üò≠
half the class doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up and my teacher thinks that means she has to wait for them
omg no
because most people in ap music theory aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ap students
at that point, it makes me feel like the teacher just doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to teach period
they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t comprehend that you have to put in effort
i just took it so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to take a final
so now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to get sad for no reasonn
should√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken bio instead of physics and csa instead of music theory
why are you taking so many APs
well shit
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking 5 classes so i took all the exams to get out of the finals
and i took 5 because my school didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me take them before senior year and i wanted to get into an ivy ü§° ||spoiler alert: i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t||
and the exams listed are the ones happening at my school, i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking 5 of the 9 people are taking
and my school only ran 8 ap classes this year
and the only ap physics class my school offers is 2 because they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let us take calc before senior year
The Physics department is good about accepting credit. I was considering taken summer classes and I was thinking about diff eq and physics 2 and the math department rejected the community college version of diff eq but the physics department instantly approved my request to take physics 2 off-campus
My school people either take AP Calc ab or AP Stats or AP Calc BC their senior year (if they do take AP classes). rarely they take both Calc and Stats but I did bc math classes are the only classes I look forward to lol
there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t enough people interested in ap to do that at my school
so my school decides to destroy their rankings by offering 13 ap classes, only running 8 per year, and only allowing students to have the possibility of taking 2 of them before senior year
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so lame. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure my school offers every AP whenever as long as you have the prereqs
I wish my school had an honors bio they only had √¢‚Ç¨≈ìaccelerated√¢‚Ç¨ biology
my school doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t offer apush, but they offer an honors us 2 class that you get free college credit from
worst decision of my life was taking Algebra 2/Trig freshman year lmao, very much had not a fun time
my school would never let us do that
which is hard to do as a 12 year old (she skipped a grade as well)
at a private school but then the public middle school in the area stopped offering Geometry in 8th grade so I think they removed the option for Algebra 2/trig for freshman but I could be wrong
I did not enjoy mine freshman year worst class prob bc it was squished into one semester with trig in the second üò≠
traumatized me with my first B in math ever
i could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone without the precalc portion of precal/trig
~~Take Math 228 if you want another~~
if I want to be traumatized again?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never gotten a B as a semester grade and i feel like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to get bodied in college
Least there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no A- so can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get like a 3.6 or 3.8 for that lmao
fair
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m throwing away my phone when i get to college i swear
College won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be that hard
Mature people who get 3.4s tend to do better in life than the 4.0s who do nothing but study and party
Lot of people that I have lost respect for due to their behavior during the pandemic even while being premed
They don't do extracurriculars, or their extracurriculars are also fronts for more partying
I can tell you I've gotten several jobs and internships that didn't even ask my GPA, but cared more about what I knew
What happened?
@_frostyyyyy_ but I wasn't playing about Ansh that mf
It was a large agricultural R&D biochem facility, and so he'd show me data from projects he's working on and say things like "Oh, so could you tell what kind of reaction is going on here and draw me a mechanism really quick of it? (It was a Diels-Alder reaction, which are kind of a pain to draw so ugh)" or another thing was he'd show me a picture of a spill or accident and ask me what reagents I'd use to immediately neutralize the scene
And I did end up getting the job, over 5 other finalists, who were from: Harvard, MIT, MIT, UMich, and Olin
*AND THEN IT GOT CANCELLED 3 DAYS IN DUE TO THE MF CORONAVIRUS*
God damn ü§©
I would not have time to do that or I would fail üòÇ
ic chris and math
I even did one in Cog Sci where I got an FMRI taken for some bonus points
That particular class was spring semester my Freshman year
what class?
The 398 isn't scheduled yet because that's my capstone
This is bad
This is an example of how credits don't equal effort needed
if everyone picks faster then we can start fucking housing registration and i can stop anticipating it
altho that might just be moderna. pfizer might only make you sore day 2
I feel like I had a slight fever 1 hr back and now the soreness sucks
I tried to attend a class or two
imagine how much it must suck to get
My mom got the coronavirus and she said the vaccine was worse than the actual thing
youtuber i follow got extremely sick b4 tests were available and she's pretty sure it was rona
Not saying it's a bad thing to get the vaccine but the vaccine is not necessarily more mild than the disease itself
Yeah!! In India it is horrible right now
altho im talking completely out of my ass i know nothing about medicine
I was only sore on Day 2 of Moderna
Did you get your vaccine yet
most of my teachers got wiped out by moderna 2 but my history and gym teachers were both fine so ur probably jsut absolutely fucking cut
~~probably bc they have lower average income and the gvt doesnt care about poor people~~
also all the seniors in SM got vaccinated early
whereas in santa clara like half of the elderly population still isnt vaccinated
so they dont have a huge excess supply of pfizer the way stanford pediatrics got
damn
it's bc the way school districts are divided a bunch of people from other counties go to school in san mateo county
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m two degrees of separation away from one of the most annoying conservatives in the country
so stanford was like "if youre from a different county we literally dont give a shit drive in and we'll stab you"
oh no i forgot im an adult!! this is such a tragedy. anyway, shoot me
i would be really annoyed by that behavior if i didnt knwo for a fact that there's way the fuck enough vaccine for everyone
damn
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s embarrassing how little photos i have of myself that don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t include my phone in the picture
I am now a double major in biology and I need it when I didn't before
Well for my mom that was how it was, for a lot of people I believe it would be like this, doesn't mean you shouldn't get the vaccine tho
Ah I think that my point didn't land
3.11 million is the number of people who have died of Covid 19
I don't disagree
Lmao I wish. Calling me that would be an insult to people who actually try hard to improve their body loll
huh why is this one bad
OH NO
I'm so sorry
please fix it
will be 3 day repair time though
i still wanna know who the hell sent me a linkedin request
miracles dont happen instantaneously slsmshmshsm
oh
oh
as soon as my last ap exam happens i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m clocking out
oh shittt
legit it could've been any of the other 15 but nope just had to be the one I'm probably gonna attend üôÇ
it literally isnt
this discord just aint for me what can I say
bro my pronouns are in my bio tho
Idk tho the meaning "sir" has kinda changed recently. A lot of people nowadays just use it humorously regardless of gender, and only when it's serious and formal is it for guys
its defined as a gendered term tho
that's not the denotation tho, which you supposedly corrected me on
i didnt choose to have that and dont really care for it but
not by my choice tho, you're coming at me for just asking someone to respect my preferences
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthey√¢‚Ç¨ defined as plural
i mean okay that's not really a good point tho, she just doesn't want to be referred to as sir or boy
not anymore.
It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t before either...
Again, I had no problem with that. All I'm saying is that "sir" isn't really as gendered a term as it is before
it doesnt have to be this deep
im trying not to i just dk why this is an argument even üòÉ
sigh
fyi this or any sentence phrased similarly will never be a productive addition
I agree that did come out wrong
Egg flavored ice cream goes HARD
oh no wut
eggs just aint my thing unless it's in fried rice, then it's tolerable
Me neither, tbh. I can't eat eggs unless they're in a dish or they're over easy.
wait im lost. what happened
rob called jen sir. jen explained that she was uncomfortable with that. someone tried to argue definitions with her? and then someone. tried to argue that they is plural, which came literally out of nowhere and is also incorrect
go fuck yourself :tasha:
Did you get your vaccine yet
It used to be bad tho I know
karpy ur a washing machine, the long lost brother to my toaster
$10 it's gonna get worse vrooo
oh my ghod the appliances
oh no
oh no
its really hard to get an entire appliance into the circle
vik is even worse
wtf is wrong with your mixer that it makes a ka-chunk noise
tf happened here
Still not right
and also the fans and shit
nope
Sad
idk guess i'm just dumb
By gangster I mean a member of the appliance gang, which was extensively mentioned in a conversation barely half a day ago on this channel
*TheRealBob has joined the server* 

what the fuck

*TheRealBob has left the server*
rip
Don't want to piss off Zacc anymore, even if that pfp isn't really nsfw
It's true tho
study time yeet
well
someone keeps pinging me and im too eager to find a reason to procrastinate
like i was grabbing items off a death chest
Damn mega chad
im such a good role model idk why they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put me in charge of more children
all my 6th grade buddy wants to do is play bedwars and among us
I remember when I was in 6th grade all I did was listen to bad edm
And m buddy's in 1st grade, he's still stuck on fortnite
ive always listened to bad edm üòé
still do
just different bad edm
i hate it here
no like on the class of 2025 post i said people could dm me and someone did and i remembered i hate receiving dms
OMG KITTIES
I guess decision day is coming up really soon
have been leaving them on delivered by accident
i wish i had gay girls in my dms </3
they weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t for awhile because my sister is an ultra conservative and i was scared she would judge me but now i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care what she thinks
yeah fuck ur sister and her opinions
did u guys know that some dudes from the island of lesbos tried to sue all the gay people in greece because they said that the usage of the word lesbian in the LGBT community was defamation
yeah i don't think they were very smart
class action lawsuit against the gays
green day puts a bad taste in my mouth nowadays tbh
because of bja√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stupid son
like what else are we gonna call ourselves?? sapphic??? sappho was also from the isle of lesbos I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they would like that either
like yeah shit you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re right sorry for making a reference to classic literature to use as a word that otherwise would not exist
just let me go home bus driver please i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m the only one here
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m literally the only person on this bus and she passed my house to go a different way
yeah every school ive been to my grade has had 3 or more alexs
ive never actually had someone named hannah in my grade but that's probably just bc all my schools have been so small theres a huge disconnect between the sample size and the general population
lots of emilys tho
sorry, number 4*
that arent hannah
just realized zach is my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s age that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s weird
must be hard being an RA when u dont understand our cultural references
my middle name is even worse so i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even go by that
problem is i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like that
i commend u for being a champion of student rights even though you experience a significant generational divide from being born before y2k
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that anyone can mess up hannah
one time i was touring a college and someone messed up my last name
only time that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happened
i think he saw the second half of evan and then the i and e from my middle name and his sleep deprived exhausted TSA robot brain filled in the rest
damn
I forgot about that
the bonker needs bonked
yeah i mean if ur a factory owner in nazi germany and you dont become a member of the nazi party things arent exactly going to go well for you
you wouldnt happen to have any gold tucked away or a swiss bank account by anychance?
he did it for the money initially
yeah i think originally he hired jews bc the labor was cheaper and then he tried to get them all protected to save money
and therefore he was able to hire more jews
but he ended up getting into the war machine and using his ties to save a lot of lives deliberately
but tbh motivation isnt necessarily important when the result was that he saved a large number of people from being executed en masse
he ended up saving 1200 people
im disappointed
u dont have the limo out front üòî√¢Àúüèº
my c got lost
yeah i sent that and then thought to myself "do i really want this?" and then the regret began to seep in
i guess so
someone yell at me to do my homework
DO YOU HOMEWORK HANNAH
I also just finished my homework
y'all why do u hate anime
@kaori_flute it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ok I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t shame you for ur interests ur perfect just the way u are :lovaaaa:
When ur alarm becomes so familiar to you so you sleep through the ringing for a whole hour while dreaming and now ur late to class
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
damn
okay, but who the hell wore a toga to school
sitting here at the ksl desk in front of a computer for 3 hours
I can feel each individual major system rebooting itself in order
I am both cold and hot
I had quite the opposite experience with my pain meds. Before I was aware of every vein in my body. Now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even sure if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m here anymore
And now you can feel your clothes
yeah it sucks :rainbowdance:
it's not anime u fucking clown
sorry for getting all heated and calling you a clown i was a different person back then and ive grown a lot in the 5 seconds that have passed since that moment
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sorry. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re school committed a crime choosing that color.
i guess ur a blood orange now
Yall got a lame graduation fit
they used to switch it every year but they stopped that after my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s year i think
my tennis uniform was somehow even worse
for three years i looked like a traffic cone
My school is trash
my school has a diversity committee and most of my teachers are decent people
Halloween school
My high school's mascot was and still is blatant racism
I didn't go to Lima Senior
my school has a lame mascot. An √¢‚Ç¨≈ìoiler√¢‚Ç¨ bc of the city√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s history with oil Im guessing?? Idk
man i miss going to hs football games
never went to one
bc we always lost
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember going to any sophomore year
two years in a row maybe three I think we lost every game
We've gone to the playoffs every year there's been no rona that I've been here
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me wrong i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like football
lol not at my school people didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go mostly bc they knew we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d lose
ouch
i think we lost every game the year i was in pep band
there is like a 60 year history of these thanksgiving football games and my school has lost 11 of them and two were in the past two years
howdy can attest our school is very liberal. as one of the head faculty put it when i asked why we have a conservatives club but not a liberals club: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe entire school is the liberals clubs√¢‚Ç¨
ur too boring
Sad
seniors at my school get let out two weeks early which is like great in theory except it means that all the AP classes are like DAY 1 QUIZ DAY 2 TEST DAY 3 LAB DAY 1 TESt DAY 2 QUIZ
Luckily isn't me
The only major assignment I had today was a 15-question test that was open note, open book, and open computer. And we could choose not to do 5 of those 15.
we get out like 3 weeks early here
actually never mind it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s longer than that
forgot we started 2 weeks late
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more like 4 weeks early
Like why tf do I have four ap tests four projects and a paper due in 20 daysüò´
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to write a whole speech in those 2 weeks ü•∞ü•∞
if we were doing third i would literally have a test on graduation day which is not what we want
you lost my h
oh
what areee your plans for the weekend
oh?
damn nice
i was at her place to give my sister a ride back home, and her parents asked me some questions, and i was able to help them with figuring out transfer credits, cuz the useless guidance counselors couldn't do shit
```an english assignment:
roses are red
violets are blue
wait, shit, isn't this supposed to be a haiku?
```
is it bad that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into [insert waitlist school here] so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to chose between it and case
I was like I really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to have to choose
the waitlist at this school isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad tbh
wash u wait list isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even that bad either they accepted 250 last year and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a small school to begin with
but the other one is my dream school and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s freaking me out that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doubting my choice if i get accepted yknow
do what you want
i really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared to reach out to any because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to get attached and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll judge me for being on the waitlist because
i still have like 2 weeks minimum until i find out
also i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry i feel like i rant about this every other night but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really bothering me
I know me too I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to have to choose
Just be like me and don't get into your dream schoo
Ayooo not getting into dream school gang üî•üî•üíØ
having a "dream school"
Is there like a deadline for the official sat scores? I'd imagine they wouldn't want them only self reported, but like I've already committed and I still haven't sent them my scores through cb
they want you to verify it
I knew it was bad but never *this* bad... jfc
money
because they haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t warned about it yet
doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to be the most high priority thing
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just to verify that you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lie
they haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bothered me about that but i might have already sent officially i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember
but if they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make you send them official reports
who would be stopped
Damn I should have said I got a 1700 on my sat
mmm i only took one semester so i did not get the whole experience :xCrittyx: i only took private lessons, symphonic winds, recital class and miscellaneous ensembles so i did not take theory, history nor eurhythmics
I remember impulsively paying to send my official score reports wayyyyy before RD decisions came out because cwru was like hey!!! We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have your scores!!!!! Send them as soon as possible!!!!! I had no idea that they choose not to look at self-reported scores on the common app but rather we have to self-report THROUGH the portal as well. Sigh. Worked out in the end though since I decided to come here lol
I could be remembering incorrectly but for me I had to send mine by 6/1 if I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna pay for it
Hmmmk on college board when I tried to send scores it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s making me pay $15
Does that work for the AP i took last year or just the one im taking this year?? Lmao did what I say make sense??
From every year you took AP exams
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m finally talking to someone seriously about rooming omg
Nah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so but it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter anyway
wouldn't make a difference, case just won't accept the bad ones
we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not very active but we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re hoping to hang out in a few weeks
i havent met anyone from my state yet üòÉ
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eaten this ever
Aww
my friend got into case but she isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going
close enough, right?
hmmmmmm o really
^^No one in my school knows about Case, and only 11 people have applied there in the past 20 years... I think I'm the first to commit
Kinda sucks bc I can't brag about attending a T50 or anything to my friends- they just assume it's a no name school in the ghetto and politely try to hide their disappointment as I tell em my future plans :(
i got a bunch of waitlists, one of which from my √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdream√¢‚Ç¨ school
but Rhode Island√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s entire square footage is pretty much taken up by colleges so I imagine most of them are going to those or to other east coast colleges
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to find out who the other person from my school that applied to case
pc moment
7 hour drive from where I am üëÄ
I though NJ was 8h?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m neuroscience so brown kinda hurted though
36 hour drive from my house
~~it took me over 40 hours to get here~~
no pee for 36 hours
no sleep only drive
10 hour drive
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like 6 hours and 45 mins without traffic
theres always traffic
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just straight I80 and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going like 90 cuz the PA drive is boring
Ngl my 9 hour drive wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, although my mom and I swapped seats every 3 or 5 hours
Doing it in one sitting is possible
FYI: if you drive in NJ, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stay in the left lane. You can go 20 over and there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always someone tailgating
isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the left lane supposed to be the fast lane
NY drivers and PA drivers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand that
technically the left is the passing lane
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìKeep Right except to Pass√¢‚Ç¨
I think the left lane is only the passing lane in states with more corn than humans
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it called like HOV
this is peak valley girl hours calling more than a person in a car a fancy name
sorry that people in our part of the country want to limit fossil fuel emissions
even if everyone is carbon nutreal, its still going to hell in a handbasket
YOU'RE STUCK HERE NOW
~~Case emailing and texting me as if I didn't commit last saturday üò≠~~
Shhh the ivies aren't real
also case hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t texted me once they admitted me and then fucked off
they already got ur money
they dont care
they still send me emails about admissions events though like hey Bob I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been enrolled since December
I mean I've only gotten 2 from the same number- my spartan ambassador... seems they have a student contact certain groups of people in *case* they have questions
what the fuck is a spartan ambassador
college guide
supposed to make you feel "welcome"
I have never been texted and I have never met a Spartan ambassador and frankly I feel disrespected
I assume Case wanted cash and they knew I wouldn't enroll unless I knew something about the school... I originally applied as a meme bc I got a fee waiver but look at where their advertising led me now....
oh
oh.
im crying
oh
i have like three months of free nitro sitting on my account but idk how to make it activate
*oh*
damn the irs got another one bois

Forgive me, you all leave me no choice
https://discordgift.site/qYdLLCnv7KYFsKVL

why get this emote if i can just reply to this whenever i want to use it
in life you only need a single emote
case is a whole 15 minutes from my house. its *such* a long drive
case is only a whole 17 hours from my house. its *such* a short drive
nah imma go back to sleep
oh we need to wake up b4 7 tmw i forgot
Yeah it sucks
Thankfully all my classes aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t time sensitive since they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all pretty big
I went to sleep at like 10 PM last night (earliest I've gone to sleep in probably half a year) to prepare for waking up at 5:30 AM tomorrow
case is only a whole 34 hours from my house. short drive indeed
short 35 hour drive for me
19 hour drive for me
40 hours with flight :D
3 hours direct flight for me
did you guys know that I can copy a url on my phone and just paste it on my laptop?
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that
it's not even like "paste from phone" or anything it's literally just "paste"
oh no
we need a LaTeX bot
Haha I am not taking the AP exam üôÉ
hated that class
Same thing goes for many other stem profs
That helps with college
I also have all of my dad's books from when he was doing theoretical physics stuff at Duke that I flip through whenever I'm bored
they're really interesting but i don't understand any of it
Oh wow your dad did physics too?
yep, he was a physicist until he realized how miserable all the physics doctorates were
Oh so he did econ after Physics?
apparently the ones at duke in the 80s were
my problem is i currently focus all my energy in learning the stuff that you don't need for the class
Because half the time school doesn't teach the things you need to know
Hm, well just "pushing yourself at something" won't actually make physics easier so I still recommend going in knowing that things will change and that's ok
I am scared for that
not really
just trying to think of the ap equivalent
I didn't get to take that class at my school because they don't officially offer it but i did an independent study thing for it my sophomore year
didn't go too far into the weeds, therevin equivalence, kirkhoff's stuff, and basic ac circuits
Oh nice! Is Physics 1 hard for people with not much physics experience
nope, i studied 2 hours for the AP test because covid and didn't pass lol
damn
both AP tests and sem1 finals were hard for me because of personal shit, I hope it will go much better for you guys
So I guess it makes sense... Chem is used a lot in BME too so I guess both are equally important
Even the ECSE department recommends taking Physics 1 second semester which doesn't make any sense to me since Physics 2/circuits are very important for EE and chemistry isn't needed for much in that department
i spent 12 hours studying for the physics exam so hopefully i pass lol
Only drawback is Engr 145 and Physics 1 are taken together, but Engr 145 builds off of chem 111 luckily
I might not take physics 2 until I'm a junior since I don't need it for anything other than quantum computing
I'm a CS major so that's why. I would definitely take it immediately if I was an EE. I'm planning to take Computer Architecture in Spring 2022 and I only need Logic Design and Computer Organization for that
I've heard that ECSE/CSDS 314: Computer Architecture is more difficult than Computer Organization and I'm planning to take that next year
yeah I don't really know
kinda pissed that chip prices have gone up so much recently though
the BOM cost of a board that i designed went from $15 to $50
ateveryone go sleep
kinda early to sleep
Class of 2024 needs to sleep since registration starts in 8 hours but Class of 2025 doesn't need to worry about that
sleep or stay up late
ew math
inside the machine i lurkk
ah yes, a mod who can't ban people, so useful
i mean it's a little hard to do my job when all i can say is `uwu pwease stop bewing mewn uwu`
Zacc is mad at Zach
Kind of a mood tho... caffeine doesn't really do much for me but I can't want to take a warm shower
caffeine doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really do anything for me either
Nice nice
I don't have a lot of experience with coffee in particular but dd's vanilla spice wasn't half bad
Though everyone tells me dd's coffee is bad and I've never actually tried starbucks
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like regular coffee
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never had dd√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never had their coffee*
Awhile back I drank too much iced instant coffee and ended up caffeine sick for the rest of the day. Never drank coffee again
Caffeine sick?
oh
that sounds pretty bad
Never heard of zevia
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like sugared soda and aspartame makes me feel bad about myself
they also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put colors in it
which also makes me feel bad about myself
Fair
I will say, I did feel like I was drinking the wrong thing from the taste alone whenbI tried redbull
Idk what exactly it is but it just felt like I was drinking carbonated jet fuel with caramel coloring
Protip for y'all do not gain a caffine dependecy through energy drinks / coffee, for one, ur health, and for two, when u need  a boost when studying for finals, there will b no boost to get
or just harder for the person who kills me to clean up the mess?
Kind of out of left field but that is so me with pepsi
I hate the taste but uhgjhhghghghgh I need more
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry you had to find out this way
then you havent seen college campus pricing lmao
The least she's paid for it is probably $5.48 tho
but it says the price on the can tho
i am bad at taking pills and gummies often have gelatin so my b12 supplement is in liquid form
still doesnt make it any less valley girl
except i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t often drink it because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like sugared beverages
Shit wrong message
they never have mango in my grocery store
what I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like about the arnold palmer is that the can has a photo of arnold palmer on it
i like mango flavored things but i hate the texture of mango
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one of the only things i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat bc of texture
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it
You can feel the elite golf knowledge shine onto your face
They're supposed to be springier
I just can't vibe with mangos and peaches
Idk Howdy
I dont think i want to eat a "springy" fruit
i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like the taste of peaches and similar fruits
Idk watermelons are so messy tho
They SUCK
make ur chef dad cut it
damn
my dad√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dad is coming to move in day though
...diagnose Vik with "wrong" for liking mangoes?
Liking mangos is wrong???
meta = bad
Ok fine sorry
I don't remember playing any other kart tho ngl

||Ayo he probably doesn't even have a penis||
I refuse to believe this isnt a onion lvl site
Baby Luigi goes hard
Or Tiny Titan if you're shit at driving and can't stay on track/Shy Guy Beach
i dont think they have that anymore
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t play enough to determine what kind of bitch i am
one of the shops didnt look quite right, and turns out you could drive through it
And also the Mario and Luigi Circuit themes for Wii go HARD
When they spam that 808 or record scratching stuff idk
i dont think i remember that one
Wasn't that from the DS
Odyssey's soundtrack isn't up to the standards of other mario soundtracks
Don't get me wrong, it's my favorite 3d mario game
But the soundtrack doesn't really compare to 3D World or like any of the other 3d mario games. Except for 64.
I haven't played oddessy but I'd imagine it'd be hard to beat galaxy
100%
I haven't played galaxy since 4th grade but I used to jam to the ost in freshman year while studying
tho there are emulators
I do still have my old wii- I play ssmb brawl on occasion
It really does
Nah you don't even need a disk
You just need a backup of the actual data in iso of wbfs form, and then there's different ways you can just play them straight up on the Wii U as if they were apps
I've tried homebrewing a little bit a while back with my standard wii- I managed to get project m running on smash, but that's about the extent of my modding experience
I'm [pleasantly] surprised that nintendo doesn't try to crackdown on all this stuff though, given how they've been with other fan creations
I don't think that Nintendo doesn't try to crack down. If they had the opportunity, they would do it. They probably have like no clue that Wii U and Wii and 3DS have been exploited and hacked to the degree that they are because their understanding of their customers is so shit
Rip
Class of 2025 doesn't register until two more than two months from now

bad
Point taken. I was honestly in the heat of the moment and really cheesed off when I said that

1000 hours is more than the time I spent studying during one semester of college :cursed_flushed:  Idk how people spend that much time in service
how do you even find the time
40 hours
i've only practiced 1 hour today 0_0
idk man. i just realized that i didn't put viola in my first message
there are some ppl i've met who know 40 hours per day but not twoset
my freshman and sophomore year of high school i would practice guitar for at least two hours a day
i kinda got bored of the violin, i've found some cool stuff again though
bored of violin

i started viola in fifth grade, so at 10. couldn't read music until 6th grade though : / 
I knew treble clef but never played an instrument
im very slow at reading bass clef tho
For context, there is nobody the reception area at CASC. So he just rolled in, and then found an office, and then whipped it out ig

oh shit
sigh
besides i hate communicating with people over text
if u were really my friend u would beam ur thoughts directly into my brain without making a fucking sound
for in person communication u can feel their vibe
if u walk up for small talk with someone u barely know like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI burned myself on hotdog water√¢‚Ç¨ they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna be like fuck off
OH YEAHHH
I have social anxiety discord is the only thing between me and death
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally the whole reason I have bangs is so that ppl can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m avoiding eye contact
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to be besties with my roommate and cry in front of her every day ü•∞ü•∞
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve accepted that i cry in public though
I was like improving at being out in person and not having spontaneous panic attacks and then Covid hit and I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t left my house in more than a year
FUn shit i swear
last time i left my state was
idk
I haven't left my state in awhile either ngl
i feel like i went to massachusetts but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think
no i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t left my house in a year I win
Last time was during 2020 fall
why leave state
i went to chicago the other month omo
okay i remembered when i last left my state
i have spent my entire 18th year in rhode island so far
My state is not the best, but I know Maryland isn't either
imagine living in  a state named after a person couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
Even if JFK died there
idk it's weird for me since I used to travel a crazy amount before quarantine
oh god oh no its ohio
this might be the longest I've stayed in one place without a big trip or something
im already traveling :KannaSmug:
Does anyone else really hate Ohio? Nothing against the people from there- I just hate the state
new jersey isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s weird that you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pump your own gas though
bro do u know how many famous ppl have died in California bro
It's not weird when you spend your whole life here XD
Idk why they do it though
money reasons
boring
equal chance of getting hate crimed
my dog went to go live on a farm in upstate new york
gotta say i saw a lot of scary signs driving up to poughkeepsie when i visited vassar
I need to eat a bagel
I haven't had any in weeks
Ayo yall havent visited Waxahatchie yet ü§©
if that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sound made up
i can never spell it
im trying to pronounce it rn
i feel like
the issue is remembering how to spell it becayse the syllables get jumbled if it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t written down
worcester ma is a terrible city
everybody mock him he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how spell work
skit - chu - ate ?
How about we call every single sauce a "tasty condiment" and watch people fight each other being unable to tell what the other person wants
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to wpi because I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to get shanked and/or sexually harassed
It's that bad?
instead of ate it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more like it
YES IT WOULD BE BAD VIK
Oh
Wooster there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a chance of getting shanked. WPI has a terrible female retention rate going into sophomore year
damn my friend is never going to get laid then
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like particularly worse a shot of getting shanked than in Cleveland I guess but like at least I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not also being called the c word by every third man on the street
Damn
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m absolutely the opposite of a city person tho if someone crimes me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna be like I CANT BELIEVE I GOT CRIMED
never even witnessed a crime before
the one reason why my grandfather didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t die working in the bronx is because he was a pharmacist
they either stop
small town life is being like fucking idk let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just break into this mildly abandoned building surrounded by no trespassing signs
City life is like fucking idk going to school and receiving good education and then going home eating dinner and going to sleep at a reasonable time
oh no
because the boomers throw a fit any time a young person, a POC, or someone with an upper middle class background moves in
getting angery at upper middle class
why would anyone get angry at upper middle class movers? am confused
cuz they are upper class
dont want to b with the commoners
cuz they are angry
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit the town√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s aesthetic
is the middle class now considered poor
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not angry at upper middle class howdy I am the definition of the bourgeois I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m mad at the idiots who think that if we let someone with less than a million dollars live in the state of California then suddenly there will be a huge crime wave
middle class here is richy rich
why does anyone still stay in silicon valley
That shit kinda slaps
Idk
that reminds me i want to get a birds aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t real shirt
Bill gates literally lives 20 minutes from my house, the middle class here is a joke
no one can afford to live in this state anymore
if we moved here this year we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be anywhere near able to afford our house
oh no
When I was younger I thought Silicon Valley and Death Valley were the same thing because they had the word valley.
both of them will kill you in an hour
Bad
Bad
Bad
Bad
Nightmare bad
literally translating a phrase into another language is such a mood
tho we are working on reforming him
I mean I know I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a lost cause
I feel like Cleveland would just replace valley girl stink with somethign worse
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t plan on staying in cleveland
fuck i hope i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end up like my dad
Only for one summer though right?
what happened to ur dad
still counts
my dad went to college in rhode island then met my mom and stayed in rhode island üòêüòê
oh i get it now
Nothing wrong with Rhode Island
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to become ohio
too late
Too late
Damn
Oh that's why my soul is sad : (
who was the governor of ohio that ran for president
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s almost like the environment doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t instantly change from state to state
idk his last name tho
you havent experienced ohio if you havent had some amish kid flip you off as ur driving down the road
do republicans even matter anymore tho
i feel like trump is stuck with them now
also scared to go from blue state to red state ü•∞ü•∞
Really unfortunate
Your not alone
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to get hate crimed
it sucks
Why you worried lol
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a registered democrat but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t favor the democratic party
just feel as though it is necessary to operate through them to get something that we want yknow
i just want us to stop fucking up the climate yknow
shoot my bad vik
People say stop hating Asian Americans n shit but like when they say that they specifically mean people from eastern Asia. Isn't it kinda racist to do that?
like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry but who tf is going to vote green
Because you basically leave out Indians or pretty much anyone else from the "Asian" group. Calling someone Asian nowadays equates more to just like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean now
thats how languages work
I guess Im not Asian anymore
society wills it to change how society wants it
most of russia lives in the eastern bit tho, the west is mostly the ~~gulags~~ reeducation camps
i think we can all agree however that we dont need an incel shooting up people
"Anyway, I don't think people should die lol"
Who tho?
How about we make guns legal for everyone but dont sell bullets
you ensure only smart people are able to use them
do we need gunpowder
iron nugget left and right column with gunpowder in the middle
i still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done my law homework
biol 216 exam tomorrow wasted an hour here :LAUGHING:
Whatre the teachers going to do if you dont do it
Take your acceptance away
oh i have a presentation tmw
Study or sleep. Close discord though
That shit was brutal
i already forgot to do an assignment last quarter
I did ask around, and there didn't seem to be a huge difference between AB and BC. Just some extra series stuff and integral tests.
if my school offered bc literally only 3 people would take it
That's why they assign like 6 in a whole hour and a half
for ab are they bad
I think for every single one, there was a single part (as every one of them is split up into a,b,c...) I couldn't do
I have physics 1 and bc on the 24th. back to back. I'll cry on the 23
Yeha, and they give a shit ton of partial credit
going to chill on that exam bc idk wtf i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to use that credit for
That sounds terrible
luckily i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any double exam days
despite taking 5 exams
Yeah lol, they're so much easier.And you can easily cheat on them if you wanted to.
my ap psych exam is at home
You're not going to believe this but I had some divine intervention in AP German; I basically didn't know I was taking it until a month before (my school signed me up for some reason) so I was big panicking
no way i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be able to stay focused from 4-7 on a thursday at home
Guess what came up on the test
wonder how that will work out
I'm doing all of mine written and in school. Online screws with me so much, so at least if I take it on paper I wont' be worrying about wifi or aomething.
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m only taking one exam at home
3 on paper in school, 1 online in school
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad my ap lit exam is online because my handwriting isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t legible and has gotten worse this year
my psych notes are the best example of my bad handwriting
I'm glad that I can type most of my long assignments in college because my handwriting is horrible
I would lose, I guarantee it
Still readable though, and that's all that matters!
smh head my
Why is your psych class so heteronormative
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
damn </3
well i went like a month without swearing here
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that we could swear here so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
buh bye üëã
i have never sworn in front of my mom
My dad said fuck to me on the phone today
The sentence without context is funnier
"Who the fuck brings a cat to a baseball game?"
so much so that the first time i said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìfuck√¢‚Ç¨ was at like age 1
a few weeks ago she thought that i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what moonshine was
It would be a shame if somebody looked at the logs :blurryeyes:
you saw nothing
you saw nothing
Oh sorry for calling you a Vermont person
smh my head zach
you cant steal my brand like that smh
Oh
Damn he beat me to it
It must be a real struggle secretly running a moonshine empire under the watchful eye of your mother
my sister bought moonshine pickles and my mom was scared i would eat one without knowing what moonshine was
Didn't know moonshine was legal in vermont
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live in vermont
except my sister and my dad are chill but my mom sees me as a 12 year old that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know anything
someone needs to tell my mom that i am an adult
my mom isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t homophobic i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think she understands that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m old enough to know what my sexuality is
(even though i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 18)
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m having this terrible phase where i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve only liked men for the past 5 or 6 months
well it wont improve here
probably because my heart got broken by a woman related situation 6 or 7 months ago
a school o nerds
cant forget that
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember when my heart got broken last
nothing improves here
I'm still closer to 21 than 22
sorry guys
harmful damn
How to find a bridge troll
its tru though
Annie, you cant take back the past
what is pain
i think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a testament to me and my personality that I still applied ED even after allegedly making that Reddit post
hate when that happens
hate being too takk
petition to cut off the feet/ankles of anyone over 6' until they are 6' or less
what bridge clearance do you need?
even though gorls dont exist
to be cut
I'm so sorry
ur not sorry
zach i've not stood next to u so idk
people are bad at guessing my height
I'm laughing but I'm sorry
I mostly was worried that I wouldn't fit under a bridge
there seems to be a problem where people dont say hi to u
poor zach
people are also really bad at guessing my weight if they see me
idk what it is
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢5 which is not short but :valleygirl:s call me short because everyone here is long people
I was standing next to her today while doing a room checkout and her head doesn't even come up to my neck
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not short
so i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not *that* short
@_the_intern_ I just finished Bad Batch and it was splendid
and the average height of amabs at my school is 6√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢0 and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fucking terrifying
oh most people were taller than me at school
and most people are short
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìtalking a lot of shit for someone in shin kicking distance√¢‚Ç¨
sad
i wanna be a little taller
my dad punching the air rn
I'm like 6'0 and I feel ostracized by this conversation üò©
Well thanks I'm 5'1" : (
Genetics lottery was lost by my whole damn family
I'm sorry Vik, ur acceptance has been revoked

I'm sorry Howdy that you're breathing the same air my dick is in
I'm sorry

I designed my final project for fish class and I'm going to do it tomorrow
Except
Fish class
im spending thanksgiving with him ü§ßü§ß because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go hundreds of miles home
Christmas lights in Toledo were an integral part of my childhood and when my extended family moved out of the Midwest I lost a piece of my soul
ok i need to sleep im going high

i ate sushi yesterday
imagine studying chem
why is chem major in a class called fish lab

That means you have a work ethic

My twitter addiction was really bad though
Yeah it's one of the worst sites
Checking social media while multitasking is tempting but probably pretty bad
I need atleast another 2k hours on that bud
i did not mutlitasking with studying tho üëÄ
my phone is burried away if i try to work
also it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 2021 and ppl who hatched full grown from eggs still aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t allowed to vote why isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t anyone talking about this
my fingy hurts so bad
yeah i went 2 hospital
to see if i need iv antibiotics
just talked about arson in law class
idk i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure the crime that people do just to see if they can get away with it is to shoplift (when you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even remotely need the stuff)
:CRYING:
calculus makes me want to die
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually not that bad
its location in my schedule makes me want to die
"What dumbass put Atlantic salmon in the Puget Sound *smacks forehead* what a dumb idea. Of course the net broke. And now salmon everywhere"-Fish Professor

Speaking of invasive animals, how bad is it that jumping worms are invading the US, particularly the Midwest?
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat cannibal fish
All I can think of is Computer Science lol and I know that aint it
I feel that
You seem to have some parental trauma
helicopter parents seem awful
sorry to hear that hannah
she was a lot worse when i was younger
did ya'lls parents ever have you guys do arithmatic books on a tuesday night at 10pm and it was past your bedtime but you couldn't solve the problem and ur parents thought you were a complete disappointment
pain
And it was those math books with the cartoon images of animals on them
and now she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s suddenly acting more like she needs to protect me than she did when i was a kid
what exactly was zbt and why did it die
zbt still exists
and then nothing really happened
Mango juice goes HARD

And its seeds are FUCKING PEBBLES
I hate mango as well
DONT INSULT THE SEEDS

Idk man the tree in my stomach be sayin otherwise
Pears and apples still way below anything else though
Except the fruit and the juice and the texture and the flavor

I drink that for caffeine, I hate the absolute flavor
huh it doesn;t tast that bad does it?
It's pretty bad
Hot take call everything coke and then suffer when you actually wanted sprite but said "coke" instead

Mad cheesy
It's so sad but so good. The first time I watched it I was on call with some friends who already saw it and they kept laughing at me
I didn't think it would end the way it did : (
Sorry I made unfunny meme
I saw it from pretty far away
But it was still sad
it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ask about soda
I realized how it would end in the fourth to last episode
I guess u got unlucky
you'd probably want a global dialect quiz
they're fucking massive
I had an encounter with one in yosemite and it was looking at me in a a way that said "back the fuck up or I will bite your face off"
I only saw coyotes in Yosemite but that was at night. Didn't see mountain lions

taft has more bikes inside than taplin
idk ehy i said this but here is a fact
cuz bike theft is everywhere

as long as there is one that looks more appealing/ez to get
How difficult is it to get around campus without a bike?
Makes it look like shit
Dis my bike (not my pic tho)
I think I need to do the tape thing or smth
Maybe I could cover it in stupid looking stickers
can't believe i got michigan
I NEVER WENT TO FLORIDA
sorry jenin, the nyt says otherwise
You don't go to Florida, Florida comes to you
damn i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hang out with my best friend at prom because most of her friends hate me
I'm just not going to prom. most of my friends aren't going so there is no point : /
they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell me not to but it would be hella awkward
and then another one of my friends isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going
Lmao I didn''t go because I forgot it was happening lol
I dont know about y'all, but they wanted to charge me monies
and I wasnt about to be having that
My school really said "Tickets will be anywhere from $100-$140"
mine is $50 because it is at my high school
prom is just whoever in the senior class wants to go
i only went to homecoming my freshman and sophomore year
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go junior year because i wanted to break up with my ex at that time
Trying to rekindle the old flame huh
nope, just lazy
bad idea dont do that
we went as friends because she didn't have a date and wanted to go with one and i got to flex on my grade
want to break up with someone? do it. don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a pussy

I got some new mouthwash and that shit is bussin
there's just something extremely powerful about this excerpt from this week's physics lab
not the teacher being like "well we dont really have time to be precise" and then acting surprised when the entire class had >15% error
still 12% error no bueno
also the program he made us use to record our data was last updated in the year 1994 and the UI is completely unnavigable

Ah I forgot about that
My hometown is a rust belt dying lesion on the map with a population declining by 6% per year
6 percent per year is a massive decline, I've never heard of a city dying so quickly
wish I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d gone to vermont so I could see Hannah
the worst part is i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know how to prove i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not from vermont
yeah it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard to prove a lie hannah
I can feel the floor shaking ffs
i think this dude is mad or something

ive never heard of it
it's a liberal arts college in middlebury vt
my cousin went to middleburry kek

i know someone going to nvu next year
or even like. if you wanted to be in vermont why wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you go to uvm
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand
never heard of it :p
probably 5% of my school goes to suny binghamton every year
probably 60% of the 25% of people that don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to ccri go to uri at my school
Probably half of my school goes to penn state
damn that's rough
half my class is in danger of not graduating this year
my teachers aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even bad it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just this unfortunate thing called not having competent k-8 teachers
i can only imagine what would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve happened to me if i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a grandmother who was an elementary teacher
didn't teach the kids how to read?
made for a sick college essay let me tell you
had things gone different yoiu wouldn't know how to read
i feel like that is kind of the bare minimum
like, actually just can't read? or reads at a low level
and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know his situation all too well
sorry i cant continue this conversation dinner time üëã
she was like EVERYONE ELSE IS READING SILENTLY STOP TLAKING and i was like I HAVENT LEARNED HOW TO DO THAT YET
sorry that my ADHD and YOUTH are INCONVENIENT TO YOU, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER
"stop being young and uneducated!!" fucking educate me then smh
imagine signing up to be an elementary school teacher and then flipping ur shit every time an elementary school student behaves like an elementary schooler
like sorry i wasnt aware that my high literacy levels at the tender age of 6 were negated by my lack of an internal monologue
its true now i  type so much word that raunak cant read my sentence
actually i get cs in all my english classes bc if i dont like something that i read about i cannot compel myself to write an essay about it
because it's like i dont care and it isnt good
this is when grades don't identify u
doesnt have to be glam
I took a horrible photo of myself in a hurry for my CaseOneCard and now I have to look at it whenever I log into SIS which I do everyday
what if i just look blurry irl, registrar's office
i wish i had a better photo :wobble:
I wrote my medical school essay over a siblings heroin overdose and dealing with the aftermath
It sounds bad, but I don't care. They woke up in the ICU and denied ever using and I haven't talked to them since
My photo already doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look like me anymore
my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s friend was trying to convince me to shave my head before starting school
i would shave my head but i have a weird shaped head and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to expose the world to it
I would rather dye it tho
Wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even be the first time I shaved my head
Nothing wrong with Ohio, I don't know why she would react like that
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s boring
nothing boring about ohio, you can go stare at corn/wheat/beans for hours
isnt that *fun*
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll also cut ur hair for a dollar if u want smth nicer than a shave
the only problems with my own hair cut are that I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the back of my head
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think you could do worse than my hairdresser who made me look like I have a bowl cut üò≠
I gave myself eboy hair without making it into a bowl cut so I can almost certainly do the same for you
I want to look like a cute lesbian not a child with a bowl cut
she had √¢‚Ç¨≈ìohio√¢‚Ç¨ as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìboring midwest√¢‚Ç¨ her face changed when i said cleveland lol
i cut my own hair as well
i regret it though i looked so pretty w long hair
anyway I gave myself an a line behind my head I can make u guys all look so fucking glam
and now that i take care of my hair and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s CURLY it looks bad short and it looked so much better long and curly
when my hair was short and i was bad at taking care of my curly hair it looked good lmao
u won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t regret my skills with a pair of office scissors
this was my last short haircut from december 2019 and i wanted to look like this again but instead i look like shirley temple
now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just sad and my hair is uneven
took it a year ig
At my school
damn
senior pranks are now heavily restricted at my school because one year they removed all of the desks and seats from all of the classrooms and stacked them in the middle of the field
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll suspend you your colleges will hear about it√¢‚Ç¨ fuck off let us have fun just lock the fucking classrooms you shitheads
why why why do i have to take a chem exam
Are pranks are fairly restricted as well, unfortunately
usually the school just gets decked out in the class color

this video is an excellent summary of part of the history and talks about the discrimination that Palestinians face. It's less than 9 minutes and it can teach you A LOT. Please educate yourself and spread awareness cuz human rights are valid for everyone

bruh imagine arafat walking away from the table in 2000, i mean like obviously there's no panacea but a two state solution with an emphasis on human rights feels like a place to begin
Idk who admin is
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll talk to annie cuz idk how the self-serve roles work lol
im sorry math exhausted your brain cells
math fun tho
wtf
cuz
who's hyped for the math gala tomorrow
:Sleepy:
arent they just gonna do the MPODS
I need the review though
yea same i want the review
i dont remember if they take other questions tho
miller was my resident last year
my tiummy hurt tho
it is sad
so i am doing my home work for the week
if whoever posted that is on this discord im sorry for making fun of u
we are not sorry for making fun of you :NM_PeepoLaugh:
i am sorry if i get caught
people love to flex either about their good or bad grades
it's either "i got an a+ *some minor inconvenience*" or "yeah my senioritis is so bad i got a d is case still gonna take me"
its ok tho cuz they do what i am too scared to do
I mean the biggest thing is case wants to take our money
money money money
stop being dry im bored in religion class

rip joseph
i feel like i have the most dry sense of humor im sorry
im sorry
im SORRY
I was about to say- isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t all physics mathematical
I could never do that but if you like physics it sounds really fun
in mexico tho
The BS in Physics only requires 4 math classes but the BS in Mathematical Physics requires 7 math classes so there's a lot more math classes
There's also a BS in Mathematics and Physics which is half math and half physics
Thats the one I want
ah so there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s physics + math
physics + a little math
physics + so much math
yeah and then ephy which is physics + physics + math + Chem + physics
I want a math major disguised as physics
You think theres physics and thus useful but really its all math
i didnt mean to send that
rn my left pointer finger is broken
I have like 60 wpm or smth just w one thumb on my phone lmaoo
my wpm is probably slightly above average idk
my left hand can go in the hundreds but my right hand is slow as shit
my brain doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even move that fast
like idk if i go from g to h i just gh swipe my finger
i just realized i only type with my pointer fingers
if anyone is ever on call w me and u hear someone doing extremely loud hacker fingers THATS me idk why it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so noisy when I type I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
me too miss girlie
i have a laptop
I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bc I type slightly hard and then extremely fast so it sounds like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just constantly hackerhands
also the Mac microphone is like INSIDE the keyboard which doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help
they could be really good at piano if they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have adhd
i was never very good because i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t focus on two things at once
my problem was if I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t instantly an expert at something as a kid I would just drop it bc I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have patience at all
then corona happened and i stopped going to lessons
rip
at least i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsorry i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to college bye√¢‚Ç¨
I played flute in 4th and 5th grade I never practiced and I was pretty bad
that was another reason why i wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t good
My Senioritis is just having no attention spam anymore
I'm going to need mitchell's to cope.
Why does everyone hate chem
Chem is fun when you can answer the math questions
I have been stuck in a car for 5 hours now and am dying
cool 2/4 problems completed on that test
unfortunately, at this school, they prefer doing the latter than the former
Pyrophorics go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR when exposed to air
bro I literally just got a maximum of 50% on the final exam lmao
And it didn't have a sureseal
probably BS or BA haven't decided
BS you have to do a lot more math and physics
not as many math
hard
they gotta put that face at the end
Damn :cursed_flushed:
you need one more
idk
im 6 ft from my laptop
not really
idk how
unfortunately, there is none to be found here
i didnt mean to leave her @ there üíÄ

I'm listening to a podcast and the host's name is also Zach and the guest just yelled "I'M TRYING TO IMPRESS ZACH" and it startled me and it also doesn't help that its a reading day so it feels like Sunwedfriday

so you can still search for me
is that a whole sausage damn
Is everyone here done with school or do you all still have AP exams to take?
i have 5 still
Why are my school's AP exams so early
ECON is split up into two exams
I missed AP Bio lol
AP Bio is not bad
AP Calc isn't bad either
I heard that course is pain
idk i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in 2
I wouldn't touch physics with a 10-foot-pole, so idk
i hate physics 2
But having taken both AP Bio and AP Calc AB, I can say that both aren't too bad so long as you just refresh yourself on the stuff you already learned.
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not though
same and my theory exam is on the last day of school ü•¥ I'd rather focus on the other 5 I have to do in that time :cri:
my class is literally on unit 3
we don't even go by units i have no idea
uh oh
i miss that :Loved:
that is why i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not trying
I did theory for 2ishkinda years and it all left my brain as soon as it was over, all I need to do is hit note and vibe
no one in my pod is going as dates i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think
Just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to dances?
But only if they also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have dates
i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had fun junior year but i was in a toxic relationship so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go
sounds terrible
I never went to any of my highschool dances
because obviously i couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go with someone when i was dating someone else
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have much of a reason to the food wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that good
I just tried to make an instagram group chat for Case '25, but I forgot instagram has a group limit smh
damn ok
rip
imagine catching feelings for someone, couldn't be me
@eekhannah Is your school hosting prom this year?
did people already pay for tickets or nah
and we have to submit a negative test 48 hours before
At my school, kids literally take off their masks as soon as they leave the school
my mask doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come off until after i enter my house after school lol
I'm a remote student, but on instagram, I see all my classmates hugging each other without masks lol
It's one thing to do something stupid, but it's another to post it on social media for everyone to see
i mean unfortunately who's gonna enforce it for them
The reason I'm asking is b/c I was admitted for the Spring semester and I'm afraid I won't know anyone when I come to Case lol
I'm hoping to get in for the Fall though üôÇ
damn
oh man i just got really anxious and idk why
i knew one person going to case starting out and now i think ive made friends?? idk
@_frostyyyyy_ I didn't either until recently
not even from my school; someone from the same summer program as me committed
Idk what that means
It wants a five-digit code
Oh mb :xCrittyx:
wtf
bye
goodbye

I have spent so long the past 2 days working on this lab report that I have a small abrasion forming where my wrist sits on my keyboard
Damn chat b dead at 4:14 am
Chat still dead 14 minutes later
Chat still dead at 5:47 am
16 pages and I'm going to bed for 3 hours of sleep before my final at noon
u need more sleep
Jokes on everyone I didn't go to bed
I'm gonna go to work even though I called off
I did however just get to close 48 tabs
You bet I did that shit one by one
Too late already working
My work ethic is unstoppable
People have died drinking 5-hour energy, because it's unsafe
People have also died shaking vending machines
But yet
omg
i went
hm cuz salt and vinegar was like 303-310
and IT GOT STUCK
and didnt give me chips
The last time I used a vending machine was probably like 10 years ago
Imagine how many free bags of chips I missed out on...
*cough* lame
Oh
with a bunch of stuff but its lame stuff
i need to get a sweatshirt
i want to hear from my waitlist + decide first though. because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to waste any money
probably going to be cwru regardless though <3
Yesterday, my school hosted "Senior Future Plans Day!" and I was the one of the few people not wearing apparalel from the school they committed to üò¶
me too and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still waiting on some
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really care at this point tbh
That's no longer a luxury to me because I have like a billion tabs on everyday for no reason. And closing them is just so much work cuz there's so many
My poor laptop
What could you possibly be doing constantly that you need those tabs open
Maybe she just never closes tabs?
i have a 100 windows open and i dont check them cuz i dont wanna change my alt+tab
I close them eventually, but they reappear on a regular basis
Gotta clean out my computer before college
I use a school laptop so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll need to get a new one
I hope I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t clutter it but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be a fresh start üòå
im gonna buy myself another mac when i graduate
And it's Einsteins to open back up
i hate to break it to you
German isn't synonymous with Nazi tho
sigh
damn
shes not saying it is tho like they admitted to it no
But I still got nothing lol
maybe you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it off the waitlist idk
this is what i've been saying for the past year. its all i want. bob has to respond

I was just checking since someone on Patio said the discord is inactive...
i guess it won't be 100% active 24/7
I have my AP micro exam tomorrow actually
I studied so much, so I'm just taking a break rn before I go to sleep
I just stopped checking a long time back
can someone ping the discord when they are doing the zooms since I don't want to ever check patio again/disabled most notifications
maybe a role for ppl who want to be pinged?
ate
I broke down and got a mac laptop instead of a windows laptop
thank you for asking :). personally i have a headache that will not quit and that is affecting my entire outlook on life. how are you?
oh damn. i hope your headache goes away. i'm doing okay i guess. finals week üò¨
one time the entire ap chem class at my school came to class on halloween cosplaying as the chem teacher
omg the ap chem class at my school cosplayed as the chem teacher one time
wtf
My chem teacher sleeps at school
Could you take a look at a few Stats problems by any chance?
I was doing practice MC and I got a few wrong
Algengruetze, ich hasse die Pille
Anybody else when they're super tired start inserting words from their other language
cuz i can barely speak english
i couldn't think of the word between
let alone another language
I want to know spanish
And so people not from florida cannot understand my broken spanish
i want to learn languages but i think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty bad at it
Try taking Mandarin Chinese. Super fun and not as hard as it looks
i was thinking of minoring in spanish because i wish i took it in high school
Isn't the AP Chinese exam on Friday?
Ain't taking AP Chinese exam
That shit too hard
How about the AP Bio exam?
problem is i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know french
I couldn't do 5 APs in a year lol
3 essays in 2 hours
fuck that just reminded me i have a lit essay due on friday
I take a lot of time to think things through before I write it down, so being pressurized to write so much in a relatively short time isn't good for me
Literally some colleges wanted 12 supplementals üò©
my worst one was 9 i think
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i got into a single college i wrote an essay for üò™
i just want to phase 3 months into the future tbh
Who wants to give their opinion to me on the 5 options of glasses I have here
I'm on mobile leave me alone
Ew phone
Fuck I realized I ate an entire muskmelon today
i ain't no fancy biologist or nuthin.
how does one lose a whole pair of shoes
i cannot find a pair of shoes that i need
Yo I just took a look at my college essays last year and all I have to say is that I'm disgusted
It's not over if you want to get a master's or doctoral degree lol
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even started college and I finished up my first yearüòéüòéüòéüòé
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been disturbed about med school admissions since hsü§°ü•≤
Oh my reading comprehension was really bad there. Linear Algebra
Data Structures and Discrete Math
Oddly enough, none of my close friends are in both of those classes this semester
Yeah I'm not in discrete math üò¢
I have like 6 hours of meetings and 6 hours of finals on the 19th, that day is going to be intense
Oh goodness
The worrying doesn't even stop once you get into graduate school. PhD students need to worry about what postdoc position they'll get and MD students need to think about residency
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so scared about my chem grade eek
I'm worried about Linear Algebra and Data Structures
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think the questions were too awful but I must√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve messed up somewhere
Kinda like missing an A by a hair vibe
Sigh
I'm just saying, the fact that I haven't missed a single point in Data Structures but I still have to get at least a C on the final is terrifying
35% is way too much weight on a single exam
I think 20 should be the max on these finals, anything more and I don't know if it's an accurate measure of your mastery of the content
Oh ew
Exams were 80% of your grade√¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏
Lol, he also said that in semiconductors class, exams are 95 percent of the grade
Exams are 55-80 percent of the grade in my classes
Sigh
I wanna forget 215 ever happened
Are chem and bio really that bad?
In my opinion chem 105 and 106 were not bad, my work ethic just limited me
I honestly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if I did well on this chem final
The concepts aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hard, Drew is a good prof, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just burned out
Yep that definitely happened
Do I wish I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done better, yeah, but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very content with my grade given what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happened recently
The amount of stuff you have to memorize for bio is scary
Computer Science is a different ballgame, it's more about using logic and your brain rather than rote memorization
CS is very time intensive but I've still found it easier than math
Oh
Oh in your area?
I didn't apply for scholarships that needed recommendations but I got Drs. Elizabeth Sell (Calc 3) and Harold Connamacher (Java) to recommend me for research
I knew both of them very well, exchanged dozens of emails, and had attended their office hours a combined dozens of times
I need to figure out what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing in her lab omg
Yeah I've only been to Rabinovich's office hours 3 times but I've emailed him quite a lot
Lol I've only been to his special office hours for the midterm and nothing else
Well it's either that or maybe Drew Meyer because all of my other classes have huge class sizes, bar SAGES
Huge class sizes are okay as long as the professor knows you. I got Connamacher to recommend me and his class had 250 people
I wish I went to Drew√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s office hours more this semester
Guys I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even celebrate that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m done because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so nervous for chem lol
I went to Drew's office hours 4-5 times and I did talk to him quite a lot but I doubt he remembers my name üòÇ
How often are his office hours?
He remembers me as the stupid girl from 105 who bombarded his office hours at the end of the semester last semester
If you went to office hours, you care about the class and want to learn. What professors like less is people who never even go to office hours and then complain about their grade
Yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t complain about my chem grade if I end with a Bü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
Professors definitely like people who go to office hours from my experience
Wow, you finished all your finals before mine have even started
I have 4 cumulative finals and 1 take-home non-cumulative final
I think I might only have like two final exams next semester though
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how many I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have
I still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t schedule a sages lol
Even Class of 2023 had trouble getting a USNA
Oh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need a USNA
Apparently a lot of people don't get a USNA until they're juniors/seniors
We still don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if optimism and manifestation truly influence outcomes
Because like those two things can be associated with hard work
I never think about luck
I have a feeling we still have to take it
Nope
lol rip
Except you know economics if you want to consider that humanities
I have ap Lang and AP gov credit but can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get them unless I take an English and gov classüò¢
I guess then it may not really help me either lol
And I can't skip che m anyways üôÉ
"Biology (Score of 4)
Required score: 4
Credit earned: 3 hours
CWRU Equivalent/Exempt: BIOL 114"

Yoooo 3 hours
That doesn't count for the bio major requirements I think
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t test out of any of the 3 core bio intro classes though
That seems strict
Probably because the curriculums are so unique to this school
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know any other college that has a bio core class focused on evolution
I feel like IB bio or AP bio credit does not help
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Transfer credits from another undergraduate college obviously work
Ehhhh I know a spring transfer student who had to take biol 214 even though he took bio at another school last semester
Guess it depends
I guess so
That's honestly so terrible if you have to retake the bio 214/215/216 sequence
bad night
Somebody needs to do that to me
Personally, I think that instead of removing the SAT scores for public universities, they should be creating a harder test and remove unnecessary majors to have competitive programs that will benefit society even more. Also, there shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be priority for in-state applicants because that means the smartest students may lose a seat to someone dumber than them just because they live in the state, and I think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really unfair. I don't think that any major other than ECE, Engineering, or maybe CS is worth people's time at a university, because those are the only degrees that will really get you a good job after college. Still many people (myself included) are rejected from programs like these because of stupid people who get in with lower SAT scores with us, and that means that we will have to settle for less-than-optimal schools, which will decrease our chances of getting into competitive jobs in the future. It pains me to think that any sane university would even compare me to someone with an SAT lower than mine when it comes to applying, especially when it comes to lower-income students or minorities who wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do well in higher education and aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t suited for well paying jobs like me. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the hard truth, but if you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t completed 20 APs before going to college, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re bringing the entire university down.
Aside from increasing the difficulties of SAT exams, universities should narrow down the majors that they offer to only the ones that matter, as I mentioned previously. Ethics and Psychology majors shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be taking up my spot in the university just because they want to study a useless field, when these spots could be used to expand Engineering and CS programs. It baffles me that people care about majors that won't gain them the maximum time:money ratio. ECE and Engineering majors are the smartest anyway, so there really isn't a need to have majors for people who won't bring up the university's rankings. All of the other programs that aren't as good (worse, useless, unnecessary) should be removed because they aren't as good and can only bring down the school's competitiveness, making those in the Engineering and ECE majors take the hit for other major√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s incompetence. Yes, other programs might also be ranked highly, but in the end it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter because those majors simply aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t important, and recruiters agree with me. Overall, each university√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ranking is super important because recruiters obviously see the difference between T5 and T3 schools, even if they publically express otherwise. Lets be honest, these are the jobs that need to have the smartest people because they are the ones who do everything for all other fields who can't do it for themselves (we have to help them make things) so we're really important. Anyway, my point here is that UIUC should remove all programs except ECE, Engineering, and maybe CS.
√¢‚Ç¨¬¶. Hmmmm that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a very ableist way of going about higher education. Also perhaps some of us care more about self satisfaction (which can come with learning) instead of monetary value. Maybe instead of blaming √¢‚Ç¨≈ìstupid people√¢‚Ç¨ you should reach within yourself to see why you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t getting picked :uniqua: especially if you think worth is determined by something like a test score. You are going to be in for a rude awakening when you enter the real world :tasha:
I do lean towards more equality in exams rather than giving unnecessary advantages when not needed, but this is overkill. Some people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to have a high-paying job right after they go out of college, and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather do postgraduate and get a PhD in some other field. With that PhD, if you plan to be a professor, well, professors make a damn ton of money if you teach long enough. And then there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s law and bio, from which you can go to law school and med school to become a lawyer or a doctor. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to be real, either of those jobs could honestly make way more than an engineer major right out of college. This is literally just from a money perspective. And also, what kind of crack are you on when you think that the world only needs engineers? Wtf? It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like they can go around curing diseases or persecuting criminals. I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deny that engineers are important, but there are plenty of other important jobs as well, all of which require as much training as engineering.
Unnecessarily singling out and worshipping stupid ideas while denouncing and shitting on everyone else is a total PragerU vibe lmfao
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLets be honest, these are the jobs that need to have the smartest people because they are the ones who do everything for all other fields who can't do it for themselves (we have to help them make things) so we're really important.√¢‚Ç¨

You assume that engineering somehow covers all engineering majors, and that as soon as you finish your four-year degree, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll become a god in all forms of engineering ever to exist. Nope. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll know some very specific field and will never be able to help anyone other than those specifically related to that field. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lump yourself in with everyone else randomly to sound cooler. There is no universe in which an aerospace engineer who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s over at NASA can help a doctor with new medical machinery or help a policeman develop new technology to stop criminals. You literally don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do shit for anyone other than a select group of people lol, now that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the hard truth. Get off your high horse, man.
This is so stupid that I kinda get the feeling that this is a copypasta and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m boutta be trolled
Exactly. At the end of the day, if you major in something you're not interested in, you'll just hate learning altogether. And when you graduate, you'll hate your job too lol
Like they really thought that they were important enough for us to care. If you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into Harvard just say that, cry about it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so mad
Yea....that test....it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t determine how likely you are to succeed in life.
when you havent even started studying in college
like, personally, (not as a boast, but so that you can't say jackshit to me) my perfect act score has absolutely nothing to do with my ability to succeed in society. 
there are plenty of people that are smarter than me without good sat's or acts
But this was posted 19 mins ago while the original was hrs ago :0
its so sad
Nono that is 100% a shitpost still
And if not they should consider withdrawing from the waitlist at case because there WILL be problems :tyrone:
Save that for a sages class
Damn y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all homies really doing ur research
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just a copy pasta from writtten by someone in another server
Personally, I think that instead of removing the SAT scores for public universities, they should be creating a harder test and remove unnecessary majors to have competitive programs that will benefit society even more. Also, there shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be priority for in-state applicants because that means the smartest students may lose a seat to someone dumber than them just because they live in the state, and I think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really unfair. I don't think that any major other than ECE, Engineering, or maybe CS is worth people's time at a university, because those are the only degrees that will really get you a good job after college. Still many people (myself included) are rejected from programs like these because of stupid people who get in with lower SAT scores with us, and that means that we will have to settle for less-than-optimal schools, which will decrease our chances of getting into competitive jobs in the future. It pains me to think that any sane university would even compare me to someone with an SAT lower than mine when it comes to applying, especially when it comes to lower-income students or minorities who wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do well in higher education and aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t suited for well paying jobs like me. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the hard truth, but if you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t completed 20 APs before going to college, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re bringing the entire university down.

Rich talk from the person who left their years server because it was a distraction
this really doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to be a big deal we just ask that you respect the rules of the server
as annoying as the spam is the really big problem here is the deliberate violation of the rules
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spamming so whatever
it always goes away on its own
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t add fuel to the fire

Online communication sucks
I haven't read the news for the past two weeks, so I have no idea what's going on
^But I could probably gather what happened based on the Instagram stories I've been seeing
be careful about what news u look at tho
insta stories arent it. read proper news lol
at this point which news source isnt biased
Even in that article Gabe posted though, I mean, it opened with a conflict between Palestian rioters and the IDF... where it says that a bunch of Palestinians were killed in conflict so the IDF's afraid of any further dissent and are aware that Palestinians are going to fight back? I meannnnnn if you're going to *kill* my bros because they were protesting peacefully I'd be ticked off too lol. Kinda destroys its own argument.
and im doing instagram cuz a lot of people are on instagram
i generally don't get news from insta as they tend to be biased (at least indian news)
I honestly have no idea what happened and how this ongoing conflict is back in the news again, but I guess I have to read up on it; however, which news article is not biased
I think everyone should do their own research because this conflict is way too complicated because it goes back to deep history yknow
but you generally should not discuss your political views on a school server. you can. but its a just an advice not to
I don't think they are fighting within the west bank or strip
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just gonna keep reading articles because I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know anymore
See idk
cause it is escalating now
Yeah it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s getting bad
I don't even know what that is
oh nvm
it happened that sheikh jarrah made it out more
it's an event that happend to call people
I don't think that's biased
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs, and nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews.√¢‚Ç¨
People are out partying on a thursday of finals week
Wtf is wrong
personally I really don't gaf if they are fighting, just leave the children out of it
those poor children died from airstrikes it's heartbreaking
Some people have already finished finals from what I've heard
One of my friends pulled out and started playing a switch like half an hour before our exam started
But when I was in high school we got Saturday Schools if we were seen with our phones, were not allowed laptops, and god forbid you have a tablet in class
I like to cram immediately before an exam even if I already studied a lot so I would not be one of the people bashing you
Lol I had saturday school once and I used my phone
People should not be using their electronic devices during class to do anything except study or take notes but a lot of people are definitely doing other things
Lucky. I didn't get my first phone until I turned 18
Tbh I break that rule and sometimes use Discord during class but I'm trying to stop that habit
Oh no ?ban
Once everything goes in-person, I won't be able to do things like talk on Discord during a class so that'll be good
Terrible
Haha, you forgot people text during class even in person
Wouldn't the professor be able to see them doing that?
oh no time to contact office of student conduct
you can just text from your laptop. Ez
I, personally, have cheated on every single exam in college thus far.
I hate myself and I hate that I enjoy it
Someone play roblox w me
You haven't taken any college classes yet though, right?
I haven't
inb4 someone screenshots
you need to run a windows update
Logic is a very important part of math to know since it's very useful for any type of reasoning
oops wrong person
I know you didn't mean to send it to me but I've never played Roblox and I'm surprised to see that it has so many players now
the increase in player base is why I left
rip
doesn't insta have notifications to tell him that
i swear to god no one ever said no memes in general this was never the problem
I miss bob :((
fuck that guy
Who the fuck is gary
I have no idea how to fix that
i actually look so stupid in this
It just fucking rotated it when i cropped it
WTF
I was tired lol
This is annoying
It's still rotating it
IDK it just randomly worked this time
Ok I have my vaccination records on my phone but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to be vaccinated for meningitis
ur face gone
but not really
Like how many credits will I need?
Like to graduate a year early?
considering not doing senior skip day because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to make my calculus teacher sad
And we ended up not doing a practice test that day bc almost nobody was in class üò¶
Hypothetically, if I get all 5s on 5 AP exams, would that equate to 25 college credits?
It seems like both the BA and BS in Biology are 121-126 credit hours
I technically took 20 credit hours this semester but that includes J-Term which isn't happening again
Nope
Interesting, some of us can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in
At least I know I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not alone since some people on Reddit are having issues
Idk
Maybe I should just delete the apps because I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even use them
I used to use those apps but I stopped a while ago
To know if someone unfollowed you
I didn't use it for my school account
But now I'm just kind of lazy and don't use it anymore
I have an AP Stats exam on Monday and I went through most of the AP Barron's book over the past week and I'm super burned out rn
I have one unit to go though
And still it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me access insta lol
Oh
I entered my security code just now and still it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me in
I don't think following/unfollowing 20 people would lock you out of your account though
But I guess if you don't usually do it, it's possible
And I usually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
Except she wouldn't spell her own name wrong
I feel like this qualifies as harassment
I had a dream that I failed the ap bio test, woke up, went to school, and actually failed the ap bio exam.
Even though I already knew how it would end since I read the manga, it was still super interesting
Plot-wise, it was like 90% faithful. The last fight was a bit shorter and more summarized than in the manga iirc, but super good nonetheless, and everything else was really accurate. The animation and art is probably the best part of the movie. The fight sequences and special swordy effects that everyone has are magnificent, and there's just so much detail and care. The only thing I disliked was the antagonist because they used cgi to animate him and it looked hilariously bad. It was way too choppy and disjointed to fit in with the really intricate and smooth 2d animation.
i'm bad at german but I can kind of read it

I woke up at around 10 and started studying on an empty stomach, because I was too lazy to eat my breakfast lol
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s almost 12 and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still in bed :xCrittyx:
i also already stained my graduation dress because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stupid :)
Why study when u can go racing
not for nothing they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got 6.5 minutes left in the oven and they actually somewhat resemble bagels
Mazda 6 b/c it the car we dont give a shit about and it got that zoom zoom
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve always been bad but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve steadily been getting less bad
I'm doing a ton of Stats review since I have the AP Stats exam in two days
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be tough tho
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I can get a 5 tho
I have an A in the class?
Idk
Does Case take 4s or 5s for every AP, except stats?
I'm worried for my calc exam lol
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve accepted that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not going to do well on my exams
If you don't get a 5, you can still test out if you pass the proficiency exam
I have my exam on the 24th tho, so hopefully I have enough time
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not too content with skipping classes tbh. esp since all of my aps are this year
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel like i should take the credit even if i earn it yknow
I feel that
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather do well in college calc 1 and boost my gpa and feel more secure for calc 2
my calculus teacher thinks i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting a 5. i am not.
physics is my last exam and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just going to chill because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s physics 2
The AP Bio credit doesn't mean anything for bio majors here since you still have to take BIOL 214/215/16
i think i shouldn't skip calc 1 tbh
cus even if I get a 5 i'm not gonna really know it
I took it last year and I got a 4 so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m repeating it
on my last practice test I got every single integration question wrong
Lucky. I have 4 left after I take stats üò¶
wrong person
Sorry üò¶
im not getting a 5 on calc though
unless i really screw up
I heard the Calculus class (for engineers) at Case is pretty difficult, even for students who previously took Calc BC
This is for MATH 122 (Calculus 2 for Science and Engineering)
I've gotten much better grades in Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra even though I had less experience with those subjects
Yes, MATH 125/126 count for business majors and biology majors but not all. For example, both the BA and BS in Bio accept MATH 125/126 but the BS in Biochem needs Calculus 1-4, all of which are for scientists/engineers
I don't know if they do. CWRU's premed guidelines are to take 125/126 if you're a biology major premed but 121/122 also work, but they're generally considered to be more difficult https://case.edu/postgrad/graduate-and-professional-school-planningpre-health-advising/medicine
I like taking challenging math courses, but I'm afraid that MATH 122 will singlehandedly demolish my GPA since I'm not really a math wiz
I'm doing checkouts for '24 and I unfortunately have stumbled across a used condom

y'all leaving?
The last spring semester final is on May 19th
Usually it isn't this late, I think the schedule got changed because of COVID-19
Finals for the next four spring semesters end between May 5-11
Since I got accepted for the Spring semester
When does it end?
Last final is on May 5th
I don't know, I would talk to the Office of Undergraduate Studies about it.
Oh, I'll email them right away then
Can confirm; not this but trying to transfer my college credits during high school took about 3-4 months, after 20+ emails with them and checking with them every week

He would definitely be able to tell though so nvm
if i made a bagel that bad
Neighbor across the street still has his Trump flag up
i have a neighbor who has several flags and signs pertaining to trump and conservative policy. he is moving though so he and his signs will leave
throw a car bomb into his bedroom
Hold on lemme see if I still have it

update: my dad approves of the bagels
u underestimate my father√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bagel standards
of studying
that's how it is with any conflict though.
war never changes
im tired of trying to explain tbh
pls don't try to make it sound like everyone is fighting aimlessly, or that it's religion or that it's complex cuz it's NONE of that
just because someone shoots you and you don't shoot back doesn't mean the shooting wasn't violent
there's still blood everywhere
innocent people are still dying.
nope
the point is israel is fucking with palestine when they shouldn't be
i'm completely on palestines side but we shouldn't sweep shit under the rug either
we need a two state solution with a focus on human rights, because the fact of the matter is palestine as a state isn't going to do super hot if we don't do something with israel
we can't have a court case without a defendant. genocide is not a victimless crime
yep. but we need israel to stop fucking shooting those refugees
React with the shit emoji if you take >7 poop breaks during school
if its greater than 7, then u cant b 007
israel has an iron dome that shoots down the rockets. israel airstrikes targets. hamas fires off rockets from hospitals and heavily populated areas. thats their "iron dome". hamas fires rockets, those are not accurate and are made to kill as many civilians as possible. many hamas rockets end up landing in gaza instead of israel.
and they aren't the same as palestinian either
but the floor is open to all who want to speak. i have said my bit
Cuz they don't have any, yet
yeah but the jewish community don't want it (most of them) and then the arab community (most) also dont want that so it wont work
It's just not fair
the warnings are lower-yield missiles. they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re ineffective at notifying civilians and still have the potential to kill. also in some cases, the time between the warning and the attack is as little as 5 minutes
Cuz the whole place is technically Palestine
With their rise in international influence, hence international responsibilities, they actually can't avoid the middle east. But they can't exactly follow the American model either cuz u know
That one fucked up pretty bad
But doesn't Israel control Murica too
Oh
can't fight over something that doesn't exist :thinksmart:
defend your side without your argument being √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe other guys are worse√¢‚Ç¨
U know what's worse? Israel's relationship with Ligma
bbbb bbbb bbbbut palestine bad asdkljfhalskdjfh asdf
Israel bad
is this supposed to be me lol
my theory is netanyahu evicted people so the palestinians would get mad and then he would be justified in cracking down on them making him look tough in the elections that are happening right now
(not the current consensus yet)
BRO NO SHIT THATS THEVWHOLE THING
ppl in Israel like actually my country SHOULDNT exist
ITT: people getting pissed at americans when they reduce the actions of their country to their leader meanwhile people have been basing all americans on those who support trump for the past four years
would anyone whos ever been to either gaza or israel please raise their hand? anyone?
no one is saying it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s analogous to American politics at all dude people are still allowed to have opinions on global politics
Nah I'm just trolling here, don't really care abt Israel
i know, i've just had some bad experiences with people calling me things because i'm from the US and our previous leader was a scumbag
i could've visited gaza but it's under a blockade unfortunately :wobble:

Sorry

one time in middle school my friend told me i was bisexual when i was closeted ~~not that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not still closeted but we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll ignore that for the time being~~ and it freaked me out so bad
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just trying to eat my FRIES and I got pinged about China and Taiwan
my ex pressured me into coming out as bisexual before I actually knew I was queer because he thought it was hot I have a lot of residual problems
i was scared my ex would hate me if i came out as bisexual so i came out to my friend group the day after i broke up with them üòÉ
don't fix the typo
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll change it back

Aren't you taking a physics final rn
*hannah has gone strangely quiet since we guessed the pronunciations*

We lucked out last year big time
Except grading was hella wack
Not yet. 4 positions open late summer
u wont be my boss
I MISS UUU
Idk how many non-major requirements I fulfilled with my Ap credits
I did get a decent amount though
I'm hoping for 25 AP credits
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get 25 ahahahahaha
The Chinese professor at case keeps emailing me
He says I just need 2 classes
I probably won't either honestly
But lmao I forgot chinese
Did anyone here take the AP Bio exam?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to die tomorrow
i wish i could do APs :wobble:
By studying regularly?
Basically changing my study habits
tis the art of studying for APs
I was just studying for calc
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve accepted that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not doing well on my exams
Yes but I took the exam last year and it was a literal joke considering over 90% of the questions were AB material
I heard the AP Calc exam in early May was kind of difficult
The 2020 exam was mad easy
Nope
oh yah
45 minute exams
You guys are kind of lucky, except for people with bad wifi üò¶
AND all of my exams submitted successfully
Bruh I had the entire back wall behind my computer taped with paper notes
But again @ambitiouslearner the way my hs prepared us for the AP Calc exams was in a way that the exams would be hella easy for us
But so much work
omg
But he was so boring
Falling asleep
Bio at my school has serious grade inflation lol
And damn did I not learn ANY material on time
everyone in my calc class either complains about too little work or too much work. at the same time. decide what you want calculus students
I gave up in Calc bc I got a 50% on the last in-person test last year lol
my calc class has serious grade inflation this year
everyone do be getting an A even if they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up to class at all
Y'all ever been Ina group and no one knows what to do for the group calc quiz and u say you know how to do the problem  but your wrong and the smart indian girl a grade below you gets mad at you for costing 10 points
These students a grade lower just kept mooching off the one super smart asian kid in their grade. You'd have a big ole clump of kids right off the side of the class as a group. Tbh they probably were still smarter than me
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been so excited for school to be over
i am simply staring at my psychology homework
I hate mechanics. mechanics sucks
that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I hate mechanics so bad
if i study them
the more I study mech the worse I do on the tests
Then maybe dont study
i just got a job today üòé
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
HATE IT
mech is worse than e&m bc at least there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s some shit going on in e&m
I like theory way better than either fundamental physics sucks shit
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s east to see bc nothing is happening
pain
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all the parts of physics that suck without anything interesting to apply it to >:(
how tf is someone supposed to do anything here
bruh idk
kusch tho
RIP
rip?

Fish exam was meh, there were a lot of toss ups
Was this your last exam?
One is the Chem 306 final paper I sent earlier, which is in 9.5 font, double column, single spaced, and has to be 15 pages, and the other is my report on the effect of aggression in male *B. splendens* when bright coloration is taken out of the picture. I made this big apparatus that allowed me to show a fish a livestream of the fish in the tank next to it, record its behavior, and then change the livestream to greyscale, and also intentionally used grey toned rocks, and a plain background so that it essentially made the fish colorblind
RIP fish bully
@jarvisthepooper @ambitiouslearner and anyone else who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s searching for a roommate you can use #planning-bunker to advertise yourself and also the Instagram page @casewesternco25 will help you find people who aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t on this server who are still looking as well
you should be able to request each other through the portal. is something going wrong and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why u need to email them :blobsweat: :blobsweat: :blobsweat:
I think it should probably be fine?? but it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hurt to double check
or a 5 if you really fucked that shit up!!!!
Annie, are you taking the AP Physics C exam?
since my school only offers mechanics and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do e&m
plus I only paid like half attention to the second half of mech so like I probably want to retake the class anyway
My school barely weights AP
my school weighs AP as honors but school recalculate it when you send them your report card
Oh
the real L is my school doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do A+ so there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no difference between a 93 and a 105 on my transcript
I mean I still got into college so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not gonna complain
I think my teacher must grade mostly on homework or something lmao
I had like a B+ average last semester, but my teacher started adding homework grades and it boosted everyone's grades üôÇ
I'm only worried about AP exams rn
plus seniors got dismissed last week for any classes we aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t failing so I got that locked hell yes
yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taking the exams :dab:
might regret it when I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get out of any classes next year but you know eh
He showed up to school even though he had an AP test...
BRO throwback to the CS exam a few years ago where u had to calculate the trajectory of a frog and ppl kept making them jump negative height by accident
Windows when I hit the restart button: :( something went wrong and now I need to restart
imagine failing to restart so hard you need to restart yourself
something about (1 + rad5)/2 just hits different tho ykwis
rip vik
This is why I don't have an A in calculus
not the tests though
I only have an A this quarter in Calc, because my teacher inflated grades by adding homework grades
homework :Loved:
You didn't get calc hw in high school?
nope
i wish they taught me calc 2 as well
My school offers both Calc AB and Calc BC, but there was no way I would take BC even though it's offered lol
it was just "core maths" for us :xCrittyx: 
the curriculum offered further pure math but my school did not have that soo
When I was in high school Obama was still president
obama was president when I was in middle school
Damn this made me feel old
We didn't see 9/11
Or at least some of us haven't
Oh same

my friend's sister took the econ teacher at my school to prom
my youngest teacher except my youngest teacher is older than my youngest teacher,
I think maybe she wrote it wrong

the youngest teacher doesnt count. forget about the youngest teacher
sorry 66
cuz why not
oh who? the geology professor
might be hard to quantify
@toomanyzs im trying to find this clip from drag race where one of the queens said "rupaul is so old i asked her to act her age, bitch, she died" but it looks like no one on youtube has isolated that bit
how does that work
oh ahhahahahaha
i will miss him dearly
If I were dead I wouldn't have to continue writing this biochem lab report

Haven't even started the discussion section pain
Idk, but there's a BME professor who became a professor in 1967 but he's retiring right now. I'm thinking of taking a class from a professor who got his PhD in 1970
If enough people do, theres no reason not to
just don't open up the zoom room that you use for classes
Yeah if most people are doing it they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t punish everyone
But you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hear that from me ü§ê
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to school
Honestly fair
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a ride to the beach and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d feel weird staying home
~~not anymore~~ but yea
why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they choose a state beach where we can get a reduced price per car and encourage carpooling
Oh really?
What if people wanted to take different classes?
Where all days can be skip days depending on how dead u are
I was born in the year 2000. Sorry buddy.
Couldnt be us
just 3 years away
my class originally wanted to ditch the day of one of my ap exams, then wanted to ditch the day of another one of my ap exams
now they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just ditching the day of ONE kid√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ap exam
Poor kid
worst part is he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a class officer
Rip
he probably said it was okay though considering he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a class officer
I want to flop all over the floor
i will either be at the beach or school in 10 hours and i do not know which
U just need a S (ass) to turn pain into Spain

Oh that sucks üò¶
Expensive tho :√¢‚Ç¨D
Ok gonna go phone overheating
Ok phone too hot
My phone is so hot
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t withstand this

Idk but Justin field face
He def doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna go to bears
He uses head and shoulders
He sucks
He isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a starter
Sigh back to sleep
How much sleep did you get?
the senior that did my in person tour told me that case students are complainers and over exaggerators when it comes to work load and that they complain as if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re competing to see who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more busy/studies more for an exam üòÇüòÇ
A lot of people here average 7-8 hours sleep
my standards: less than 6 hours means death
average sleep: 7-10 hours depending on the day
Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve learned to stop working at 1 am and I sleep
I only work beyond 1 if I ABSOLUTELY need to
Probably more frequently around exam season
Idk if that's much by Case standards
No it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not terrible
Depends on the class but we cover multiple sections in a week
My teacher doesn't teach us lol
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t experienced actual live teaching in any of my core sciences at case yet so
and I'm getting it today üò¶
I'm going to hop in one of the study rooms soon, so cya guys for now
woohoo hope the side effects arent too bad
Thanks, I've heard bad things though
I need to study for my APs, but I'm definitely going to lose a day due to the side effects lol

he's dead
He doesn't use the Invisible status either so he is 100% not online
Sorry, I was too lazy to check üò¶
Some people use the Invisible status though which makes it seem like they're offline when they actually are online

Lol, I got four wisdom teeth removed last summer, I had to eat soft food for two weeks
I got 4 removed too last summer. Wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad. I somehow was awake enough to record myself act like a dumbass when I was high on pain meds and anestesia
when i got my wisdom teeth out they had to put me on oxy because the prescription strength tylenol wasnt working
literally was in pain for so long
simply dont get high
I somehow didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t out myself
However, you do not invoke the power of the logs without just cause

Couldn't go to sleep

I WANT A CROCHETED LOBSTER

sorry
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say sorry to me
just finished my exam
was for the ap exam
^ me when I took the AP comp sci exam freshman year and got a 1
Sorry about that üò¶
supposedly only like 10 or so kids between 2 AP comp sci classes of around 30 each even passed the exam lol
Oh, was you teacher bad, or was your exam just hard?
teacher was that bad
nothing to do with the difficulty of the exam
I remember reading about how someone on reddit had posted about how their computer science teacher took a practice exam and got a 3 xD
He basically handed out the answers to quizzes, exams and assignments a few days before so never really learned bc he never even really taught us
Oh that sucks
Did you end up learning coding on your own though?
nope, the teacher killed my interest in learning coding
Oh üò¶
might take like an intro class at case but idk
I'm taking a coding class over the summer
A lot of people at Case lost their interest in coding after taking Java
The intro class is not an intro
or dont
cuz 132 makes people want to commit sudoku
i think ozguner's class is easier
but again i did not study when i took the class with connamacher
i dropped the class :xCrittyx:
What's wrong with writing?

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know where to draw the line tbh
whatever you feel comfortable with i guess
getting too personal i feel like might push them away
also im sure they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve heard worse tbh
I wouldnt tell them about the shit you took this morning
Too personal is anything that would make them feel uncomfortable
cant have you dropping out and case losing a meal ticket
he needs his 5th lambo
When it says selecting a 2nd major interest is optional but won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me unselect it ü•≤

uni storage might be better tho
and i wont have the space to store yet
for money you can
spensive enough they dont tell you the price til its too late
at the end of the semester
cuz case has a free shop for broke kids, and they are always looking for more things
I dunno, I didnt use them
I dont like/trust them even more
i broke
there never was a discount
It says they can do storage for up to 4 months hmm
am I even a valley girl if I hate coffee?
You hate peanut butter, so yes
This keeps on happening
i never got a bagel girl role :(
I called dorm movers yesterday to inquire about their storage prices, and I found out that pickup is free only on "feature dates" which have since passed, so you must pay a hefty $270 in addition to the $40/item fee that they charge
Well too bad because now im a country boy
wtf is that SCAM
so she won't be able to ring the number anyways
But I can't believe they charge $270 for pickup after the feature dates have expired
4 months
huh not bad
Fuck you
my broke ass might as well store my items in an empty room inside tink and hope that one takes it during the summer
but 44 for a total of 4 months isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad
You deserve the death sentence
oh
Damn, RIP Jeff
rip
that's the worst place
OH
unless you dont
Howdy's pulled it off, because nobody knows who he is and therefore they can't kick him out lol
oh clarke
how do I lose the title of valley girl
you dont
when to derm and they stabbed me again. All I feel is pain
^Just leaving some creepy emojis before I leave lol
Wtf
cat is purring omg
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired mods
Wtf is a o patio
I might be wrong though
idk what GroupMe is lol
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not lactose intolerant but ice cream doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like me
It's just what everyone uses, unfortunately, and it's trash
Idk, Jenin would probably know better than me
doesn't everyone use whatsapp?
yea i dont think students would use whatsapp
it's better than groupme tho
everyone else left
it says it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist anymore
you dont exist anymore
Still a long ass name
What ever happened to the counting channel?
Considering that you are a math major, getting ahead in your core Calc classes will help you in the long run
Even if I do get a 5 I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t plan skipping 1 or 2 tho planning on taking both again
If they offer winter break classes again and they have Calc 2 as a class I can take during that and I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t skip them. If they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t then I might start with Calc 2 but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure
J-Term was special this year due to rona, usually they have a May term, however it not included in tuition so its like 1k per cred hour
Ope well I don't think it's as common as GroupMe at least for campus stuff
we aint john tho
They might have J-term again tho and just charge for it this year, who knows.
ur navigator likely doesnt know, but i guess its a start
Welp now I have to go tutor a kid in math that is definitely smart enough to understand topics the first time when learning them but I can just tell he never pays attention or takes notes (because I ask to see his notes and he says he has none) and just gets tutored instead of listening to the teacher .-.
yep üòÇ can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t complain on that end
sucks for his mom tho bc she thinks he actually needs the help when he could just focus during school lol
i hate how i look with makeup
Fuck the makeup
im late to that convo but i threw it in anyways
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve an ac but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use it often
That fucking penguin
I would go to prom but my mom doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want me to go
my friend decided not to bring his boyfriend (he goes to another school) so all 3 of us r single tonight ü§™ü§™
my mom doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want me to go bc I want to bring my boyfriend lol
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tempt me :cursed_flushed:
The meal plans?
i stopped by the live for a little but it froze for me ;(

@Phys Simp Bad
I actually searched up dniym bc I didn't know what it was :cri:
server dead
k we need a horny jail
idkman i've been here since august only
I had heard that Case gets pretty cold in the winter, so I figured it wouldn't be that hot in the summer...
So, Cleveland has extreme weather conditions (i.e. it's either too hot or too cold)?
I thought it's pretty cold in Vermont...
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never even been to vermont. i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like in vermont
Nothing to see here
full disclosure: i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been to vermont
It's so cold in my room rn
lying is bad
the air conditioner at my house broke last week so can no longer go to sleep with the house being 72 degrees :( lmao
wtf
Just found out I was nominated for a Tower Award for Physics at my school this year huh
my biggest achievement was getting the dj to play boys don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cry by the cure at prom
it somehow happened and it was the best moment of my life
poor violas dont play hehehe
Something better than what I already gave Horvath, so I don't embarrass myself next sem
But "better" for me doesn't necessarily mean, hmmm
i hate everything
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know who keeps changing my name so i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to blame jenin
I dont think ur one to talk
unfortunately bernie sanders is not my senator
Global warming shit is getting real
what is wrong with my weather omg
it dont
i can put whatever i want in my status <3
not me hoping to get a 5 on calc ab not knowing any 3 dimensional calculus üòÄ
I did so many practice FRQs today, don't remind me lol
I don't think so...
I think you need to get to multivariable calc to do 3d stuff
I did the bc ap last year
washer method wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t on my ab test last year üòé
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even want to skip calc 1 so
just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pay much attention in unit 8
Lol I did so badly on washer and shell integration, I still don't really understand it
for some reason that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the one thing that has stuck with me
I found all of the worksheets from last year
haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done that since freshman year lol
they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t match up though
at least the ones on music theory didnt
isn't it too short and too wide a sticker for the space
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking the most paper exams out of everyone at my school this year so i get to do it the most <3
i know nothing
i was staring at it trying to figure out the bottom function ü•∞ü•∞
howdy, this is why I like math, problems like these are fun
I forgot the dx
This one is just a ton of work
and it was still just a ton of work
And I have already forgot how to solve them
But I don't think we learned shell method
It's all topics I no longer remember, I finished those classes, I want nothing to do with them
UTech just responded to me about mac vs pc: 
The reason the suggest a PC is that there are a few software/programs that WILL NOT run on any Mac OS that you will need.
why does utech not seem to know about that
theres gotta be some reason why they are so adamant about windows over mac for us
As a CS major I personally don't think it matters as much, in fact most of my CS professors use Macs
i dont know what these utech people are on about
Generally, the more you are well-versed in IT and technology, the more you hate Apple products
i have used both for a long time and working in it support i can recite directions from my head for fixes and processes on either os because i have done it so many times
Welp time to get Starbucks delivered bc Im too lazy to drive 2 minutes
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so
Idk ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏

:Sleepy:
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t study for my calc exam in this environment
i have 2 left
i already took and failed my AP exams earlier this month... ü•≤
study!
i failed my music theory exam
i probably didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fail psych or lit
hoping
i decided it was a good idea to self study AP calc, macro and microeconomics this year since everything was virtual and i thought i would have a lot of time on my hands
oh no
i procrastinated til march...
i crammed the last 3 units of psych the night before the test
no i had a class we were just 3 units behind
my district doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have school on mondays this year and that caught up to us ig
we did finish calc and physics though
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even come close with music theory; made it to unit 4 i think
then took the test so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to take the final
discord stopped showing my spotify :(
You on mobile? It usually won't show your own there
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand why someone would want to use my spotify because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have premium
in response i simply don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go outside
just find someone they target more than you
if I go outside with my sister I go no mosquito bites mwahaha
mosquito getting blood
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know my blood type and that bothers me
i have never had blood removed from my body
problem is my parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
my dad forgets when i was born do you think he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll know my blood type
rip
thats not that far away
yeah considering you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone 18 or so years without knowing
will u feel like
it would be september but there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this really inconvenient thing called 600 miles in the way
soooo kdramas? or random sound that just happened to be korean LOL
chat died again
oh uh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch
man i havent listened to this song in so long
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to have any of my friends from my high school do it because spoilers
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s scary :(
the vast majority of the emergencies dont involve students
they just happen near campus
Just dont b dum
There have only been two people who have gotten hurt
Another kid got hurt under my watch but that was because he tried to grind a handrail with a bird scooter
About a block away
Except it was Ashbury and 118th
bad area
Rip
I thought Vermont was cold
fuck you
someone who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t insist i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m from vermont
you absolute fucking clown
Ninjago away
I still have mine like kind of displayed
i forgot ninjago existed
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s honestly a shame zach the ninjago tv show slaps so hard
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not bad, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s good!!! but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also really bad
when i'm a doctor I want to have a Baseball and Star Wars themed office
my optometrist has a bunch of old optometry equipment in his office
he also has pictures of people who are banned from the office on the door
I feel like I could sue if you did that
You will lose any case against me
getting sick of my clear frames
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably because they stole frames is my guess
it is 2 minutes away
2 mins too much
I have bigass Korean wire frames bc I hate having blurry peripheral vision
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what suits me
the optometrist will rip u off
i used to think glasses suit me but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so anymore
Jenin if there were WEPAs in the res halls you'd be like "oh noooo it's downstairs i wish there were wepas in my room :c"
i now want a printer right on my bed
~~all i'm having in my head from this convo is scrubs~~
since only one of my eyes really needs glasses
seriously considering contact lenses tbh
i know a better solution
don't have a bad vision
and then u dont need glasses
eyes are hard to stab tho
my prescription isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t strong
I have a near sighted eye and a far sighted eye and so the eye doc said "no" when I asked about contacts
i think my current ones are like -1.25 but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s definitely gotten worse
oh that's not terrible
now im thinking
at least i dont have to walk to tink
they should totally be able to do that ur doctor is a coward who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to do paperwork
idk freaks
why cant we get contacts tho
this sUck
you should absolutely be able to get contacts
can't i just get one pack of farsighted
tbf my eye doctor person lowered my prescription so i wouldnt be dizzy all the time
sigh
yeah that sounds like your prescription probably was wrong and then he fixed it
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see for shit
seeing as correct prescriptions don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make you dizzy
nope i didnt have glasses at that point
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talk to me about not seeing for shit miss √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmy prescription isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that strong√¢‚Ç¨ I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m legally blind without my glasses on
bc they were so different i guess
idk they talk fast korean and im not very fluent lol
so they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re uncomfortable to wear
idk if you can tell but
prescription (-?)3.5 left and 0 right
idk what my prescription is can you see that on the frames or something
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not even scratched i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got like thin pieces of glass coming off of the surface idk what happened
mine arent super thicc but
WHEN ONE OF UR EYEBALLS IS LONG and the other is SHORT
I keep telling my skull to stop deforming my eyeballs and it keeps not listening
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get over the difference in the lens thicknesses that is so funny
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
if only I was born in the fucking Stone Age so I could be attacked by a lion and die
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6wcONoSfM horrible eyes in action
Mfw I found out that my nose is just crooked my old glasses weren't
i did not notice the nose
dont stare at him next time
he saw so hard he became afraid
God: clean ur eyes
Maybe idküòÇ
this is only about half of the glasses I apparently don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a picture with all ten
At least I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch hot female dogs
Even I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a dog
the thought of someone putting on their glasses right before-
im crying
when ur glasses need glasses
i think my right eye is slightly worse
first picture was taken in nyc, second was taken in rhode island
i wish i lived in vermont
i miss the stars
i've never seen the stars üòÇ
oh :cursed_flushed:
i miss bobbot
do u tho
bobbot is nothing but a legend these days
idk how y'all still remember bob
i forgot he existed after enrolling
remembered he existed in orientation week
Cuz I see his face every morning I wake up
Cuz Bob
He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like trying tinder match
I never understood why they couldn't pick up that ball and run away
its fucking heavy
you cant climb
cant swim
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not 17 anymore
Damn I turned 17 in 2016
i turned 17 in 2019
I turned 17 in 1903
now i need glasses
How the fuck did you know Pete Alonso
Cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a international student and I lived in host family
temperature went down to 80 hallelujah
I hate yankees
so sorry you couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get married them dude hope the laws are changed
He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not elected to hall of fame cuz he used drugs
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that inanimate objects could take hormones either
Sorry for talking about sports
or play super smash bros tho I guess that was only a matter of time
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know rods had fingers
Long and hard
idk if he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s straight but he has lumps and hinges which is antithetical to being a rod
rods aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t necessarily used for smashing
which subsets of people tho?
Im surprised zach hasnt hit y'all with the unnecessary horniess yet
men can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be rods they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re too structurally dissimilar
idk sports who are the Mariners
idk but apparently @ariglockner used to play for them and as a result he can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get married
I like Randy Johnson tho
There was an op Ed about how nohitting the Mariners shouldn't count anymore
They are also bad
FUCK THE HOUSTON ASTROS
They hit trash cans instead of baseball
Altuve looks like a french bull dog
For anyone who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XNW1qHN9w
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
He was 6'10 I don't think so
IN ELEMEBTARY SCHOOL????
WHY DID WE HAVE 3 CY YOUNG CANDIDATES LAST YEAR AND NO OFFENSE AND THEN THE MLBS BEST OFFENSE AND THE WORST STAFF
IT DOESNT MAKE SENAE
But Castillo is the worst starter in the bigs
all this sports talk makes me want to ram my head through a wall
Fuck you
Haha sports bad go do a differential equation teacher's pet
It seems there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re many baseball fans in this channel
yeah but isn't sign stealing common in baseball
Houston sports is a lame
Another reason why people hate Arod
And they lost jj watt
But being monumental dicks like bregman and altuve isn't
His peripherals were excellent prior to his injury he was hitting the ball really hard, although his walk rate took a dive. Just low babip
Actually baseball is super stupid for a lot of unwritten rules
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want sports
take me to the ballpark my ass i'm trying to eat some sushi
Ouch
I exclusively watch women√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s badminton so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to see any balls... üòêüëç
I guess it's not exclusive to China
The base ball is supposed to be white...
you joke, but i've seen him in head to toe baseball gear
but he didn't see me üò¶
oh
Lame
I mean if a soccer team in China were called the Chengdu Chinks, that would be lame right?
not bad
redskins is as bad a term for an ethnic group as is the term chink
Sorry, they must be whites transracially identifying as Hispanics. Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean to judge üôè
Vik fuck your BMW üò†
The car shook and chunks of rubber flew past my window
Knew shit was goin down then
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll never drive a bmw in Cleveland
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna get robbed
I'm surprised bits of money didn't fly off
you'll feel poor in comparison
dont be an idiot
and nothing will happen
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just hide under the car
And pretend I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dead
U can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rob me
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rob me as I will be SPEEDING past you in my BMW
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even valued enough to be a stripper or prostitute
Nooooo I wanted to hate you so badly but now the hashtag stopped me npooooo
dw, zach and his smart car will be in hot pursuit
I will paint my face when I go out to prevent Asian hate
I will tell your bio prof to fail you so that you can't be a pre-med
@howdy_. $10 Zacc√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna read that quote and think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 100% serious
Jarvis wants to kill animals
Killing animals in inhumane...
Woah woah waohg tampering with shit I might have to report you to the offices woaaaahhhhhh
Why I wanna kill animal
Stop Asian hate
Yea Biden sold them weapons
My parents told me
I don't have a smart car
Dumb car?
And since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m liberal I am too
Idk if I spelled that right
oh shit i don't know the bearings of fuzhou, but I'm pretty sure it's infested by Taiwanese spies
I thought that was most Asian parents though
yeah we need to annex Hong Kong faster
They just get orgasm from pain@chandachan
Jarvis, the complete integration of HK into China was written into the treatise between China and UK in the late 90s
Fuck em
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist
Damn Jarvis u not really anymore
Fuck magret thatcher
Ayo fuck all Bri ish ppl
Stupid heads
She messed up uk and gave away hk
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a dog vik
Sad
Also China straight up staying they own a chunk of India even though they just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I don't agree with CCP policies in regards to the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities within "autonomous" provinces in China
Why doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t China treat some bitches instead :eggdog: :eggdog: :eggdog: :eggdog:
Aight HK isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t China
Fuck
They suck Xi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s honey like milkers
So I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have credits
that shit finna be 0 because i'm turning you over to the politburo
Damn that was a POWER nap
Sad
And then I kinda rage quit from roblox but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to sleep
You just need to run faster than the other dogs tho
Ayo the Queen be a snack tho üòã
This hurts me
She kinda bad
When isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t he
Room too hot without fan, room too cold with fan
TOO COLD?
no i cant
theres not enough room
cant, that would make me unable to open the closet
oh no
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a dog
Its not even 3am yet
A Chinese dog
I leave for five minutes
I called it cuz my icon
oh
sorry
Wtf
Jarvis is really committed to his fursona
I wish we were talking about sports still
Ayooooo that warning tho
I wish we weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talking
Literally censored everything and still got warned for nsfw :fingerguns:
I said I would go to sleep an hour ago √¢Àú¬∫√Ø¬∏
dog censorship doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make it not obviously porn
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand
What did I miss know
god I wish I knew
Did you know go the fuck to sleep is part of a series!
Dog censorship
dog comma censorship
We passed edgy a long long time ago
Damn
@jarvisthepooper I will do something to you, you Chinese dog
Fuck ur a tool now
I was wondering if Zhanda forgot a word
End Zhanda
also jarvis√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fursona is a dog that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t racist
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be shy, drop a link
Why zhanda like to fuck me
oh no
Where√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the horny jail when you need it
We need to create a social experiment
since when can zach control the weather?
only babs and her weather machine can do that
*he doesnt kno*
Short for Bob
Damn bro
Cuz she is so recognisable
shit you're not wrong üòÇ
I never thought about it like that
If you were given a dog steak but you weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t told it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dog I bet you wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be disgusted
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even eat lamb
you'd be able to tell if its kangaroo tho according to zach
dog meat is not halal buddy
bro if u were given a human steak but weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t told it was human it would probably be tasty too that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make it morally cool
You can tell if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s human tho because there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be cops outside your house
Like it's probably Jarvis who eats dog meat üò†
why do you hate dogs vim
I know that my dad has literally eaten a dog cus he was hungry
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a level five vegan. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat anything that casts a shadow
All I will say is that small water glasses ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fun
Damn
Damn
how do you know that a dog isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deadly
If they kill you they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re deadly
Not like there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a dog poison
angry dog can go for your throat angry cow relies on blunt force
u didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that one thru
Angry cow can probably crush your internal organs in one charge tho
Zach sorry for stealing your memes
yeah but ur internal organs being crushed will take longer to fully kill u then getting ur throat ripped out
Also easier to stop a dog from ripping throat out than it is a cow from ramming into you head on
Just dodge to the side tho, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what people do with bulls
Sorry not everyone has sharingan
if u smack a cow on the nose it will stop
DONT
if u smack a dog on the nose it will get angy
:peepoMadpuke: that video is awful
i dont even remember what it was
but i know it was a nightmare
dw i have
their bites are still in effect
oh sorry üòî
fireflies dont bite
I feel like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be much harder to punch a cow on its nose as it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s about to ram into you than literally kicking a dog anywhere and like ending right there unless it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a massive Rottweiler or smthn
huh i wanted to stay longer wym :xCrittyx:
I have mad respect for cows
Nope
Why do you want to punch a cow
Damn
Just because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m Indian doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m Hindu
if only @jellieellie were here, so many missed opportunities for deez nuts jokes

I will write you in the death note
^^^evolution at work, creationists are stumped

Idk I dont watch his tiktoks
no one famous has gone to my school
One alumni from my school started a car dealership and gives 1 student a free car every year
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know who the man is
oh apparently someone who went to my school plays or played, idk which, for the Los Angeles Angels Baseball Team
.......apparently someone from my school who graduated in 1985 is listed on wikipedia as a convicted murderer & rapist, executed in 2008 :cursed_flushed:
and the last notable alumni was 2005 hmmmmmmm
public school tingz
I did nothing üò≠

the school sucked with sports :KEKW:
Funny someone became a football coach from my school because my school NEVER wins football games :KEKW:

damn my list is really small
that's sad
this is so sad
Richard Spencer is an alumni of my school
not the army reaching out about a card that i filled out nearly 2 years ago üòÉ
I mean doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it make sense they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re getting back to you when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re 18
so basically what recruiters will do is they ask you to fill out a card for more information. they came to my internship location and presented right. so i filled out a card. they never contacted me. now when i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to go to college they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhello?√¢‚Ç¨
but i turned 18 8 months ago
they definitely lost the card
bad timing army
like he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going to the Air Force and not choosing the school with $18k scholarships? Or?
He got $18k from local scholarships for after he returns from the air force
yeah hannah you're wrong it's gaslicking
never call me that again
ew fuck sam ash all my homies hate sam ash
oh
guitar center is even worse
i have never had a good experience inside a guitar center
they just never have what i'm actually interested in
and haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t touched it in a year üòÉ
close
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never visited my family in north carolina
nah, usually the pickups on a tele are hotter, and even sometimes p-90s or humbuckers depending whereas the strats will have relatively cold single coils
it was the guitar leo fender designed when he got kicked out of fender and wanted to give CBS the middle finger

RIP
Humans are not repopulating quickly anymore
dont you dare start you two
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know a single girl who is enthusiastic about children
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t :cursed_flushed: me
Having children is a very bad investment
we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all going to be dead anyway
Climate change is not going to kill everyone, even people that are very pessimistic about it don't think it's going to kill everyone
If you are excited about having children at this age you probably aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in high school or going to college
we get a long winter instead ;)
But talking about financials, having children is a very bad investment
Imagine the money our parents would have if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d invested all the money that they spent on us
damn
Buying shit
Money =/= happiness
It can buy you fake friends tho
@raunakwastaken But, in all seriousness, parents don't think about "having children" as a financial matter
point of having children is to have someone to take care of you when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re sick and crippled
I didn't see that sorry üò¶
Obviously parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think like this
So, we can't just look at things solely from a financial standpoint
what's wrong :eyes2:
what if i want to be a riser and a grinder
OH HANNAH IS HERE
i though this was 2024
I got 20 hours of sleep on the weekend lol, I don't like to rise early
fat man with a surfboard
oh
im still trying to get this
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to miss the ocean
do we know what it actually is supposed to be?
but it looks like fat man w/ surfboard
I wake up at 7 AM most days, 4:30 AM sounds horrible :cursed_flushed:
where did you find the logo
actually jk i don't have a schedule
god i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not looking forward to staying after school for another ap exam
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not too bad
i only have one left <3
omg i just remembered i'm picking up my cap and gown on wednesday :,)
I was exhausted during my exam today, but thankfully I won't have to wake up at 8 am for exams anymore lol
Oh gl
not as bad as physics 1 though
How about Physics C, I heard that course is also a pain
because it is a hard courswe
i wish
i hate everything about physics 2
I don't like Calc though
omg did you take calc ab today
That's why I said I hate calc, because the FRQ section was kind of annoying
oh no no 5 for me
i never took ap physics 1
half the physics exams were today and the other half are tomorrow
AP physics and Chem were the hardest shit I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever taken
Me taking the AP test ü§°
she said it was the hardest test she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ever taken
I thought about taking music theory bc I thought √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwell it can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be that hard√¢‚Ç¨ and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t üòáüëç
the test on the other hand
i thought i forgot to how to do the chain rule during the ap calc exam
Who cares about chain rule.. math is just made up mumbo jumbo anyway ü§ì
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure I forgot to do chain rule on one of the FRQs tbh
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not getting a 5 I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be getting credit anyway!
watch me do great on the rest of my exams and the collegeboard is just like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtf happened here√¢‚Ç¨
you'll at least get a like 3, and that's absolute worst case scenario
see the beauty of calc is i either know how to do the problem or the collegeboard didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t anticipate my mistake
i'm retaking calc in college
both my college prof dad and ECE major brother are like "retake calc in college"
my wrong answers are never one of the trap answers
we only used collegeboard questions in class
and you got an entire year till that happens
if theres a need
would this be over the summer? i feel like it's really early to start anything for a class that hasnt even applied to case, or college in general, yet
bruh, 2026 dont even exist yet
We could do it for 2025 I guess over the summer
That hurt
and really understand class structures and difficulties, dorm life, etc.
It's not a bad idea to do it for 2025 tbh
Since people couldn't do as many campus visits due to COVID
i think it's a great idea for 2026, don't get me wrong, but you may be jumping the gun pretty early
@jujulb Do you think it's a bad idea to do it for 2025?
in terms of dorms, class rigor, etc.
Yah I got a campus tour two months ago I think, but I barely saw the campus
and class sizes too üíÄ
She's class of 2024 I think
The high tomorrow in Death Valley is 107 :cursed_flushed:
I'm not in death valley, now am I
i work tomorrow
work :KEKW:
all my friends are making plans and i keep saying like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhey can we do it another day i have work√¢‚Ç¨ and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìum if we adjusted to everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s schedule we would never get to hang out we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to include everyone√¢‚Ç¨
but i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hung out with them in like so long cuz they always make it weekends or when i am working so :(
What are working for?
Why u wake up so early
because i have school
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m awake!
I wake up when the sun comes up bc the sun shines directly on my fucking face bc of where my bed is
my physics exam starts in an hour ü§™ü§™
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m literally shaking and crying right now stop
crying about deez nuts
my anxiety doesn't believe in me :KEKw:
tell your anxiety that you are David √¢‚Ç¨Àú25 (Math & Pre-Med), child wonder, and nothing will ever prevent u from achieving your goals
almost back to all A√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s even tho I told myself I was giving up lmao
My teacher lmao I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t :KEKW:
lol I feel that
i'm also buying KanyeCoins but that shit is super volatile...
oh shit üíÄ
I'm from Texas, so I was wondering if you were from a nearby state
How come u don't speak the accent
he lost it
Tho it's most likely cuz I went to a certain kind of high school
i wish i took spanish instead of french in high school
all you need is
oh no don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me wrong
The fact that I know so many French and Italian names, but not a single sentence in either language
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a kid in my school gave up a full ride to case western and go to northeastern paying 50k a year
Miss horny
I thought they were ranked behind us last year or so
Yep still behind us
You need to let go of admissions stats
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t for med school lmao
i know someone who went to a state school for premed
and she went to northwestern for med school
From one person who has 3 years of experience studying premed, to a person who hasn't finished high school, yes you can
I don't think your HS stuff will matter that much when applying..
You know that med schools don't look at your sat right
also
1480 is not bad
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t over pressure yourself
If it's on math?
any class rlly
Bro time to lay some truth on you and that is if you don't drop the pretentious shit about scores and grades nobody is going to want you as their doctor
U don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to do striping to pay loans after graduate
0 reason to take that risk. Case is a T20 so even the gunners mald if they don't get in
Leave it in Dms
Crying
anyway i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m writing a speech for public speaking i forgot about üíÄ
idk sports
Yea I drop yet
idk sports
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m crying so hard for celtics
My friend taught me football because "I need to know it for college"
Basketball is much better though because they don't stop every 2 seconds0_0
And someone who goes to an unhealthy amount of concerts
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just college
oh
I watched that Warriors and Lakers game by watching the twitter threads and talking to my friend on the phone who was actually watching it. Poor LeBron he got flamed every two seconds during that game
The warriors got NaeNaed on though
I hate worriers btw
I want the Warriors to lose always because of my hatred for Draymond Green
Noooo I felt so bad for them. They blew a 17? point lead : (
And then I think they lost to Memphis
L Hospital James?
Last semester all the CS projects were due at midnight on Friday night lol
thanks for doing most of the physics lab for me, I am so sorry sam üò¶
EW EW EW DONT MENTION THAT TO ME WHEN IM NOT IN 215
Some of the freshman/sophomore classes here involve something like MasteringBio/ALEKS/WebAssign (automatically graded online homework)
That hit too close to home
I really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have an option to pick a prof for 216 this fall
bio is really cool too bad i suck at it
i'm extremely good at electrons and I still don't know why
AHAHAHA I WONT HAVE ZACH AS MY TA
it be zach tho
Heck no I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t waking up early plus all the sections are full
No I need to switch my 216L Friday with a 216L thursday morning because I need to make room for a 300 level biochem class
So I took 216 in sophomore year
i just ate ice cream and am too lazy to leave
I see. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have bio lab on Thursdays so
i've been doing circuits for a hot minute, I've been able to do kirkhoff and therevin for a while now. just think of every minute you spent socializing in high school and I was doing EE
early :wearycritty:
mmmm idk
damn :0
If u r not already sick of ice cream I'll keep u updated lol, I'm actually happy that I go there a LOT less often than I used to, cuz where I live now
Couldn't resist
i might get a phd depending on how much i hate myself but thats a good 4 years out at least so i'm not gonna get ahead of myself
Almost died of heart attack
i'm never sick of ice cream :evilclap:
Oh gotcha gotcha
Idk if I wanna get an MPH or stuck to my public health minor
I've never met a poor person who wanted a degree in economics
lol i ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rich
I just find the subject fascinating
It went 70s then 90s
the 90s were boring from what my parents say
Rich people like studying economics more?
I wish I had room to minor in econ sigh
don't tempt me
Paid services are much more accessible and are cheaper in India so the middle class and beyond can afford them
New money gang don't go to college
well new money compared to the people i go to school with
I found an article in The Atlantic that says that rich people are a lot more likely to study English and a lot less likely to study economics, physics, math, or computer science
So I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m poor
I think rich people that want to be richer will go into majors that put you in industry like comp sci or econ
rich people that are already so rich they don't know what to spend their money on will study more "useless" stuff
financial support isn't a concern for them so they go do whatever tf they want
i wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't do something with my life
well not really, because then betty kenan would be like "where's your son?" and then your parents would be like "getting a lapdance" and then betty would be like "what the fuck why isn't he at williams getting an english degree and finding an equally rich significant other"
yeah we aren't absolutely fucking filthy rich
My ancestors are a bunch of pasta rollers who work in the railroad industry and get killed by the mafia
nope
my ancestors are idk
i grew up in a house in the middle of a forest and learned how to work with my hands
some of my ancestors have been in this country for 400 years and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know who others are ü§ö
So u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know where they immigrated?@eekhannah
It's now 10:29pm, pls don't do this
i know i'm full but i'm hungry
OH I HAVE CAPS
ok no more caps i feel like im shouting
not to kill the dream but
im sleepy too
Ouch
my ip address even thinks i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the neighboring town
and i just said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live there√¢‚Ç¨
There are very few Dunkin Donuts in my town, there's between 5-10, so I never eat there
Oh yeah sorry that's my mistake
so i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dox myself that hard
I'm not American, but isn't that basically Vermont
Who trying to not pay taxes
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s problem tho
tomorrow is my second to last day of high school damn
My school has physical graduation ceremony tho
Cuz catholicüíÄ
i recently had to sign a paper certifying that i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t defame anyone in my speech ü§™ü§™
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not defamation if it ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t false
I think ur school has a history of ppl defaming during commencement
My frd√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s school had kids throwing smoke bomb and fucked up some school computers during senior prank
Then the school prohibited senior prank
Wtf
Preapproved pranks aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t real pranks
Wtf
And thus my class won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything interesting
ours is preapproved but my principal just wants chaos ig
she's also letting us fuck up the dean's office
one year the senior class released pigs labelled 1, 2, and 4 in the school
Idk
Idk all the school deans I had are bad
people used to clap when the dean confiscated a phone at lunch
My school dean rn gained so much hatred and ppl photoshop her face to kim jong un
idk
Nothing like keeping your shit protected
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have money to buy gifts
Tbh I don't either üòé
Getting in debt with my parents :fingerguns:
no parameters means i switch to alberti bass for the last 11 measures
eleven measures is hard to work with
tf getting in debt with your parents what
are they even secure? you really shouldn't buy a lock unless the lockpickinglawyer can't open it in under a minute
I mean do you just spend all your parent's money without any sort of limit or care???
uh I never spend a lot so they never ask me to pay them back
I mean I don't either
But I personally just don't feel right if I don't pay them back
lockpickinglawyer doesn't have a video on it, but it's top rated for hotel usage, a bestseller on amazon, and reviewed positively by other reviewers
And I doubt any master thieves are going to be prowling around campus and breaking into every dorm room. And the fact that there's a safe to begin with, regardless of how good it actually is, is definitely something that can deter anyone who's trying steal your shit. The only downside is that they aren't water/fireproof.
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need a safe
Idk why you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d want a safe?
Idk it's cleveland man
And I lose shit easily so I'd like a safe place to store stuff
I half-packed my things tonight but forgot and so I just rolled out of bed and stepped into a box filled with silverware
Pain
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the email requesting that i rsvp to senior awards night and now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a delinquent ü§°
Too cold without blanket too hot with blanket
Pain.
Eye drops for allergies are hitting tho
Nah don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even use a blanket. Surrender yourself to the monster and embrace it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true form
no don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep love
i dont pick mine up until next week, I think
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have a cap and gown :naenae:
We got tuxes instead
sorry for your loss
I was too broke for either, I just wore clothing
your school didn't have caps and gowns to borrow?
I hate when schools decide what color gown you have to wear is based on gender, it's so dumb. Like if anything just **randomly** select half the school to wear one color and half the school to wear the other if they really want two colors of gowns
My graduation was in the sweltering sun and I had to wear black because my school hates it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s students
we don't even get to pick our size
but then one person doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up and the whole thing is thrown off
but then if you have a group of friends whoops can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sit with a few of them bc colors aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t alternating
YOu don't see me having problems with colors
well there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a problem when the school wears one color and people above a certain gpa wear a different color
would be awful having to buy a suit just for graduation
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRenting tuxes√¢‚Ç¨ so they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even fit properly?
drive through pick up, drive through the school they put it in the car, go home
The place where we picked up our tuxes from was right next to school, so no problem there. Just went in, spent like 10 minutes dealing with the adjustments and stuff, and went home
So it's not that bad
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s saying it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work at his school
Really not that bad
And the dude was bashing my school's renting of tuxes, not saying that it wouldn't work in general up until now
Jeez jen, stop poking your nose everywhere
*participates in the server* StOp PokinG YoUr NosE
I missed something?
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten one

Me tomorrow during interview √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m available to work every weekend√¢‚Ç¨ 
Weekend in two weeks *I need figure out an excuse bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to universal studios with my ex* :cursedflushed:
like I could call in sick
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll work
but then they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou need to get tested for covid√¢‚Ç¨ :MonkaS:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in Cali, hour or so from universal
OH
Well then they prob won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hire me if I tell them beforehand tho
and if not then you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to work there anyway
No I have school until late June üòé
david the interview already happened?
But then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m also going to Hawaii on the 19th and won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be back until 26th :stressed: so that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a lot of weekends missed but then like after that I could work every day
Even during the week
Also if your job has ANY kind of specialization they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be hard pressed to find someone as badass as u
job isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t everything and if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re anything like my job they will be understanding
YOU HAVENT HAD THEM
I need to tryu
I don't eat much candy lol
i eat only candy and somehow have lost weight over the weeks
Yall lucky damn üòî

Pay Jen laffy taffy to do your homework üëÄ
omg
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna write that stupid writing sample
Oh shit I need to get that done
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not bad at all
Do I need it?
It took me an hour tops
I would hope so it says 60-90 mins Max
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to do math tho üò©
THE MATH DIAGNOSTIC WAS FUN
i took it too early before it could be removed from my portal
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done the math one
but now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gone lmao
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to take it
Maths is fun tho
If it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not on your portal don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sweat it
Just cause you can imagine a world without gravity
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never had a good physics teacher so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it
but solves both problems
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pee again
I need the cuts on my hand to heal faster so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to explain during interview that my cats a dumbass and fell off the dresser so then I became the dumbass and tried to catch him
U want some tips and tricks?
1. Apply pressure if still bleeding to help create clots
2. Use antibacterial ointment to reduce inflammation and infection
3. Use (somewhat tight but not too much ) bandaids to create smaller cut gaps
4. Wash off blood
5. Use moisturizer (ONLY IF FULLY SCABBED) to help skin maintain moisture and heal faster
6. Wear gloves
Are you getting a job just to see what the peasants feel like
no I want spending money
Well more spending money bc only tutoring twice a week rn isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t enough lol
$50/week ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it rn
Within weeks of each other
and universal was not supposed to happen but now my mom doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want me to go to prom with my ex so instead we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just doing universal
mine is today and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m nervous ü•∫
moral of the story: don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t run in sandals
Damn
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re being sarcastic pls
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never sarcastic
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a whole sensory thing and a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to see my feet√¢‚Ç¨ thing
AWWW
I- can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
oh he looks polite
I feel bad for people who have to leave their pets at home when they move out :(
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sad
me being 10 hours away from my cats
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna have to leave behind my guinea pig
idk what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna do i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna cry
omg one of my suite mates has to leave her guinea pig behind too, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re trying to convince her to bring him üíÄ
Yo I cant stand wearing socks unless I have to. Given the opportunity I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll wear just sandals
my boyfriend rarely wears socks too so you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not alone üíÄ√¢≈ì‚Äπüèº
i hate wearing shoes
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t register my cat as an esa and bring him because he has health issues and it would not be a healthy environment for him
even though he is the only thing keeping me from not wanting to cry at any given moment
also i feel like i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the time to dedicate to them
ik a couple esas that actually have health issues, and keeping them in the small dorm is just so so bad
plus your other cats might be sad if he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gone :(
oh i couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it üò≠
Welp, managed to kill another conversation, my job here is complete
i told my employer that i would be leaving in the middle of august and i still got hired despite the fact that i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be there the last few weeks of the program
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably going to say something along the lines of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìuntil I graduate in June I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be able to work most weekends, a in a few weekends one day I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to do bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had something planned for awhile and also the weekend of my graduation and the following weekend I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be in Hawaii as a graduation gift but after that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be able to work anytime during the weekend and even during the week√¢‚Ç¨
they open at 7am and close at 2pm so probably means like 6:30-2:30
Oh that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad
yea when i got hired last year i told them i would be going away for a week after getting hired and they were cool w it
they are really not that bad
its hard at first but you get used to it
i be working like 3pm-11pm
Damn
one point that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll look good is that i have nothing planned during the actual summer so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m free any day until I start school and when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m back home during breaks and summer breaks I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be willing to work there again
true but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not really needing to spend the money on anything since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still with my parents so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kinda nice for me
not really
i dont live in the city
You want a run down shack where I live?? It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be $1mil+ at least bc of the land :cursedflushed:
idk what mine are lol
Still need to do the letter :blobextranervous:
I have to leave in 45-55 minutes ü§¢

cuz i hate working past 9
she was like ill call u back and she never did :(
Where do you work

Meditated and need to leave in 40 minutes :peepo:

:Sleepy:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve literally never gotten a B
I need to stop
Nah but I need to focus on learning instead of just getting a grade
I never studied for exams during high school so now I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t burn out :kekW:
When you feel like you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t smart enough to deserve a college
sorry but im lazy :xCrittyx:

Me 3 minutes ago: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never gotten a. B ever√¢‚Ç¨
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a case interview
I did in math freshman/sophomore year bc I was a dumbass and took too hard of a class :^)
should have taken Algebra 2 and not Algebra 2/Trig
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve only had one A- but my school is easy so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really not comparable
my school didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t grade on +/-
freshman honors bio was my worst class which i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even count
because it was freshman year and i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
my teacher wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very good + i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care at all
I only ever took accel bio bc my school didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t offer a honors bio :( only an AP bio in like junior/senior year which I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take lol
me being a neuroscience major after my worst class was bio üòÉ
If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m math do I need to take math classes :cursedflushed:
I think i just need philosophy classes
Bro BME gets all of the juicy math, physics, and bio
fuck
only one i like is math </3

I did tell them about my days, told them I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be able to come back and work for them any break/summer when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m home from school
what do people like most about working here
would I be surprised if I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the job? No bc I have no faith in myself. 
Will I cry? ~~yes~~ maybe
better over than under tho
are you sure it isnt a front for the mafia or something
as long as you arent in organized crime
i need to dye my eyebrows again
It was super casual tho but still nervous on why she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ask a lot of questions :blobextranervous:
idk lol they dont rly need to know much
They prolly already want you
They dont care about you as a human
literally was like yeah 18, senior in high school blah blah free time I hang out with friends blah blah going to college in august blah blah can work here whenever I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m home during breaks/summer break
10 mins

Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it climate change and trump
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEverything is terrible√¢‚Ç¨
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize it at the time though. also very insecure
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i was a sentient being until i was 16
before then i was someone else entirely
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have cavity but I got 33 teeth
A tradition for seniors in our school after we receive diplomas is to smoke a cigar
My school have monks
Monk cigars? I figured that theyd be against cigars because of strict religious stuff idk

i just had my last day of school and i baked cookies for my ap lit class üòå
ap lit was my favorite class this year; everyone showed up everyday and everyone took the exam so we were all very close and i just :crii:
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to start sticking my hand in all the pockets at the thrift store
Just be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìjust checking the depth of these pockets√¢‚Ç¨ if someone asks you wtf are you doing üòÇ
Just gonna throw the idea of working at goodwill and taking out the cash when the clothes come it
omg there is a goodwill opening near me
i have never been inside a goodwill
I never had a savers
savers is fun except sometimes it feels like you're on the brink of being sexually assaulted
OH NO
last time i was at savers a lady came in without a mask screaming at people and i accidentally looked at her then ran to my dad
That seems
no i ran away from her
Best run away so you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get shanked
it was ugly though
i dont know what happened to her but i assume that she was asked to leave
One tried to punch me once
oh no
jarvis wtf
He used all his dominos money
Oh
oh
The left one
You went to the wrong university
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think you could farm strawberries on the moon
i don't even like the beach that much im just terrified of not having the ocean near me idk
damn
It could be a LOT Worse
I like sugar but if I get a sugar rush I crash HARD
Goodbye 12 hours, hello sleep coma
Sold
U won't die from the food, but getting knowingly ripped off by the meal plan is a different story
im so tired
Damn
sorry
Wtf is a moonrock
Either lame weed or awesome geology rocks
he just wanted to go into my parents√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ room
Don't fall for their bs
he wants to hang out with her
Dog
I just don't vibe with looking at "The pooper" every time you type
she was underfed by her previous owner and now she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop eating because she thinks she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not going to get food again
Awww üò¶
Crying
oh no
If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not a pooper my lack of passion in math will let me can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t define my race
having trouble keeping my eyes open
how to get away with murder is not calm
my dog is masterbating in the corner of the room
and i cant fall asleep
wish me luck
what am i supposed to do now that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m out of school? die?
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all are lucky. I still have 3 more weeks
and yesterday was my last day in school because senior exams exist and graduation was postponed by a week
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m have classes until june 16 rip
You guys probably start in august tho
no we started in mid september this year. but seniors get out early here
Oh dang
i was supposed to have a bio exam from 10-11
but the professor never gave the class the access code for the test
so the whole time the class just hungout on groupme and now we all have 0's :LAUGHING:
i think like 9 of us emailed the prof and we even tried calling
He can't fail all of you
What class is this?
sometimes people are tired
I can have dream even a 15 mins nap
I had 3 hour nap yesterday and I was dreaming but woke up right when the dream started getting good :KEKW:
U mean hook up with someone?√¢Àú¬†√Ø¬∏
Nah just it seems like u feel bad about waking up from a award ceremony in dream
Horrible
i forgot my ex√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face tbh
Jealous
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be in clarke
I can sometimes control my dreams. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s either what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping for will happen in a dream or the exact opposite will happen.
Usually can either fully control the dream or can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. Usually not in the middle
Jealous
Like normally if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m near an ocean in my dream a Tsunami always occurs bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping for it to NOT happen and I end up waking up
one time i had this epic three part dream and i realized it was a dream when my friend showed up to graduation wearing a chicken suit. when i tried to fly it transitioned into the next part and i was no longer aware it was a dream
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happened to me before
I tried to wake up in my dream and I thought I did because I √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwoke up√¢‚Ç¨ in my bed....
but apparently I was still in a dream
This prob happened like 3 times in that dream. Tried waking myself up but just ended up √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwaking up√¢‚Ç¨ in a new dream in my bed
like i was dreaming inside my dream if that makes sense
My worse one is a little girl without face holding a blade ready to chop me off
my worst was prob when I ended up sleepwalking and talking around my house bc I was being chased by the wolf from little red riding hood
that dream was awful
like at one point it felt like I could see my mom who was in front of me irl but at the same time I was still asleep and dreaming
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so scary
David I hope u won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep walking and humping something in the kitchen one day
:KEKW: I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleepwalk anymore, one time occurrence type of thing
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s scary combination
my grandmother made the mistake of coughing during that and he said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìshe has yellow fever! get the net!√¢‚Ç¨ or something like that. and my dad was present during this situation. it was described to me years later
I tried to go back to sleep during hook-up dream as I woke up but ended up in new dream :CB_pepe_cry_music:
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve only witnessed my grandfather sleepwalking once. at my aunt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s house he took a nap and started walking out the door saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to the zoo√¢‚Ç¨
when my sister sleepwalked she told my mom √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi have to talk to my teammate hannah√¢‚Ç¨ and she knocked on my door and said something that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make sense. i was confused and then she left my room and went back to her bed
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember
this happened 3 years ago
Ouch
I bet u need to stare someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face all day
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never experienced it
Either my fam got killed or me getting killedüíÄ
The short man is going to slay u
45 mins of class left today and I have nothing to do during it :(
I still have to do the letter to my advisor :KEKW:
My advisor never even mentioned the letter and my SAGES instructor never mentioned that sample thing I had to write ü§£
I think it doesn't matter
Somehow they never asked me for it
It makes me curious why they make us spend time on so much stuff that doesn't matter
air conditioner at my house is finally fixed after a little over a month without it :HappyShark2:
just got mail saying I need to register for the Selective Service because I am between 18-25yrs old :PepeCry:
if they ever need to start up the draft again
feeling good to be a woman
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll never start the draft again
Sorry mr President but I am medically diagnosed with a microp*nis ü•∫
i have nothing against the military I just would never want to be a part of it üíÄ
omg
broken legs? can't serve
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a Chinese spy I want to serve
i dont want to give them my email or phone number :PepeCry:
but i dont have a 2nd phone number :CB_pepe_cry_music:
as for phone numbers
disappointed I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a spam phone number ;-;
they probably won't spam you
i never got emails from the govt about the selective service thingie
Don't you need to register for Selective Service for FAFSA?
thats how they recruit the poor
just remembered i should probably request my transcript from my early enrollment school
everyone has to do fafsa, not just poor ppl
I never filled out fafsa bc my mom said no lmao
but poor ppl probably need the free education the militray gives
The government wants soldiers, right
and since we need to be "america #1" they need number
Search Vermont college then
ur looking in the wrong place
ohh I thought fafsa was required bc my school district made us apply for fafsa as a graduation requirement
i guess im also listening to music as it has a sick soundtrack
now i have an ad i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end on an ad
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t afford spotify premium and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also not really worth it when you listen on the computer most often
ill have a playstation in 4 years tho üíÄ
Fuck me
I mean fuck my life

Money
I would buy dodge coin and lost all of them
my mom wont let me touch my account with the money ive been saving for 18 years even tho its my money :cursed_flushed:
my divorced grandparents are buying me a laptop and an ipad because they are constantly in competition with each other
as someone who is not materialistic
My mum used my money which I saved for 18 years to build house
i need those it just translates to other things
but one of them is already helping me pay for college
ope need to break it to the otherone now
Sad
Wish god bless u
i think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sad that they feel the need to compete with eachother
i wish they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Hannah, I wish nothing but the best for your grandparents and if they need any assistance in their old age, I can provide them with my phone number
oh
i have a pre-paid phone plan so they shouldn't call me that much
My grandparents are mostly dead
Or are you implying that they are slowly decaying due to the infirmities that come with old age
whoops almost thought mine were mostly dead too, thought only one was alive but realized there are still two alive :ope:
don't forget to collect the life insurance money :tasha:
uhh idk what u talking about
someone say something that will make me want to leave

He went to western reserve
He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fucking holding a pistol
Just cause I use it doesnt mean I am a redditor, m√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢lady

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going to leave me a voicemail :(
I didnt submit a phone number with the Selective Service thing :KEKW:  Only gave them my spam email LETS GO
and for phone number they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ask me for it when I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t submit one
i don't think so but in case there was
I was freaking out about how I got like 20 100% matches and then I realized that I probably answered my questionnaire way too vaguely
it needs to dry and then we will see
Glitter never escapes
isn't it the point to eventually have it all over u
a piece of my xacto knife broke off and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know where it went

I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I think the college decision date for fall ppl passed

USC was my dream school, followed by Vanderbilt, and then Northwestern :crii:
Yaaa but I have a friend who goes thereee and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m all about diversityyy and school spirit, which idk about case :crii:
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s quite normal cuz international students in general has less understanding how tuff is international student in American college app
ew school spirit
i was qb too!! i was only a cps though. i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply for the ncm because i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i deserved it
OH HEYYYYY

prolly cause school spirit sucks and is stupid
Noooooo girlll I literally didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply CPSSS so I just did NCM and became finalisttt I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t match thooo, idk why I ranked ivies and stanford and my IQ is üìâüìâüìâ

UMD is lame Denzel
UMD is a sports school which bad in sports
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still waiting to hear from a school i probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into. but probably also wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t choose over case even though it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmuch better√¢‚Ç¨ (don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe in that) school
whats wrong with this
And Denzel UMD has a mad ugly campus
Idk y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all, honestly I was planning to go to the west but for some reason I got into schools in the east moreee
Sameeee, or at least if my waitlists don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pull thru SKDKFKFD. They sent me a shirt and a huge assssss banner, did y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all get one tooo??

Semester has ended and graduation happened so it's moved up. I'd say at this point committed people are freshmen, and the 24s are sophomores

People otherize the people in East Cleveland and behave as though it's an absolute war zone with nothing to contribute, and if you're outside at night somebody is going to shoot you at a moment's notice. 
My first incident as an RA was a boy telling me "Where can I join the NRA? I want to get a gun so the people can't steak my money and my clothes" except he said it much more crassly
"Omg, East Cleveland is within the vicinity of my dorm, will I be targeted for assault and battery late at night if I walk around campus? omg"
Omg this is scary
The fuck
Man but y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all honestly idk, I just watch vlogs and google mostly. I try to get insight from my fam who lives in the states, but I really have no idea about the lifestyle there, etc. I hope I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be fineeee, idk if east coast is worst than west butt yaaa welpp

when i was arguing with someone in 2nd grade
they were insisting that grenade by bruno mars said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìid jump in front of a *plane* for you√¢‚Ç¨
Wasn't it a train?
:Sleepy:

Weird. It's clearly still february
Oh no that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too far

I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve sworn it was 1962 an hour ago

*uh oh*
anywhere from 2-4 hours of video games everyday during the week and ~6+ hours per day on the weekend
got so bored of the game/burnt out that I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t played the game at all during senior year until now
Luckily when I build a pc my progression will transfer for destiny 2. But for apex, will have to start over :cursed_flushed:
Isn't it really hard to get a video card right now or has that ended?
I have no idea I recently looked at Nvidias website and it looked like the cards weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expensive/sold out but other then that haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t looked much into gpu√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s
I'm still using a graphics card from 4 years ago since I can't get a new one
I'm still using integrated graphics from 4 years ago
they hardly worked then, they don't work now
I'm considering getting an external gpu for my laptop
because having graphical power seems vaguely useful
Using a built-in chip and not having any clue about computer customization :fingerguns:
using a built in chip and having at least one half of a clue about computer customization
Building your own computer and choosing all the components :fingerguns:
dying :fingerguns:
Building your own PC is a blast
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trust myself in not screwing something up
Intel Integrated Graphics is so bad for gaming
I tried running some light games on my laptop a year ago and it ran at like 10 FPS and sounded like a jet engine :cursed_flushed:
at least yours doesn't crash when you move the computer
laptop
üçø I think we found the kid whose going to carry a giant ass razer everywhere cuz "muh frames"
I tried playing destiny 2 on my laptop that has integrated graphics and sheesh never heard anything louder than those fans
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to the mall today and ik i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to wear a mask but that makes me uncomfortable üòêüòê
I think you can still wear a mask if you want to
i went to the mall on saturday and i saw people without masks and still wore mine despite passing two weeks after my second dose on tuesday
i swear i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to the mall everyday
It's been so long since I've gone to the mall
idk i guess i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just stocking up on mall time
just b careful about them, they keep "finding" dead bodies in the back since its a convenient place to drop em
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at the mall rn and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m wearing my mask even tho my family isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lol
I can't tell if you're being serious or not
he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s never not serious
its one of the reasons the nearby driving school doesnt use the lot even tho its like completely empty
You already know someone is going to pull up with an msi brick with dual Boeing 747 jet engines with a laptop cooling fan to class
There's already a kid in my class who did that
don't get stuck in magnolia
If you play piano and want a practice room live in a Mistletoe building
magnolia is just bad
Housing selection went really badly for me since I started late and nobody on MyCollegeRoomie was responding to me and there were very few housing places left but it didn't matter in the end since I stayed at home
i can think of at least a few times when howdy wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t serious
why be serious when you could be delirious
Where did you find these?
i have no clue what they r tho
I left those blank
don't fill them if u don't have to
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sad :(
@jellieellie why are you sad
Hi sad I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m Raunak
til piano is gonna be pain if i try to play
esp on left hand
cuz u gotta stretch out ur hand
and that's the same pain u have when u workout
nah it's just tendons and ligaments and shit
i hath been trying to practice octaves
pain :xCrittyx:
sad
~~i mean idk how to play piano and i just started today sooo~~
octaves are hard you shouldnt start with that
I don't play piano,, but I do play guitar and oh boy does it suck for your fingers when you start

yea idk why people hate on him :wobble:
idk why they single him out
if it's the facial expressions then i still dont get it cus a lot of pianists do that too
and when you're playing, you don't have the brain power to hold yourself back
I don't do crazy facial expressions... yet
I don't deserve it, you need to have some credibility
i can't facial expressions with flute :wobble:
With cello I actually can't control it at all
i am not a gamer and i do not wish to be perceived as won
oh gawd fur elise is in my head
My computer has a glass panel and a lot of RGB lights üò≥
tho I don't have desktop so external keyboard isn't really necessary unfortunately
Not a gamer anymore though but I was when I got the computer
my mouse isn't rgb but my keyboard is
my laptop is my laptop
ok here's something by lang lang i dont like
I really dislike how he plays this
It sucks
It just sucks
sorry im listening to sth that is not classical music rn :LAUGHING:
omg
i am stupid i apolofize
RGB in this context refers to colorful lights that people put on their mice, keyboard, computer, etc.
it is late oclock
I have an rgb mouse but a huge ass spider went inside it and I haven't touched it since
But i actually broke it so it doesn't change color anymore
They fell on my foodüíÄ
is it really that bad
Bruh Vermont is too cold for cicadas
one time my cat ate a cicada
she just straight up ate it
*oh no*
Dogs eat them tho
And fuck up their stomach
she used to kill dragonflies as well
i hate to break it to you but she is no longer with us
Oh
Can't relate :(
I want sleep or death
I still have 25 days to go ü•≤
i have 3 days left to write my speech which is overwhelming
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just scared to send it to anyone because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m always stuck up about my writing
the most terrifying part is having a graduation responsibility and not fading into the background :/ do i wish i could
yeah that's gotta suck
Well if you want some proofreading or anything I got ur back üôÇ
i read it last night at like 2am and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 6 but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m mainly worried about it being cheesy
to be fair, people probably won't be listening
well technically still am :KEKW:
It was very bad
actually brain dead names
Oh and here is what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m running :^)
some dude in my school has a keyboard that looks like he spilled coke on it 3 months ago and just left the coke there to crystalize
welcome back to sad reality
some days i wish i could just
sleep thru
i should probably work on my speech but i have a feeling that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just going to sit and stare at the document for 3 hours
don't mess with legendsclean
@kaori_flute I handled a early golden period Strad today, didn't play on it cuz I didn't wanna embarrass myself
"Last week I sold one for 15 m"
Cheaper cuz that one has gone through a lot of restorations
Should I work for him after I graduate
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have her number
grocery store bagels are objectively bad
Where are you supposed to get bagels from then?
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be worse than one time someone gave me some blueberry flavour bagel
Damn
oof you still have hw?
School doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end for me until the 25th
damn that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when underclassmen finish exams at my school
Your done tho
oh no
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a super senior in my public speaking class and she had the nerve to call me a freshman
like girl you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even graduate high school on time
Oh
I thought you woke up from your actual sleep at 7
kinda wishing i went back to sleep to be honest
told myself i was only dreading writing it but now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared of forgetting how to breathe üòé
it is so bad that i have places in my document signifying when i need to breathe
i originally had [breathe] but then i realized that could be problematic
zoom university 2024 dunno
robin you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re literally going to a nerd school idk what to tell you
Nope, not here
Lol rip
This PHED requirement is really annoying imo
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to get a job at dunkin and walk there everyday. that is my exercise goal of the summer
Well even so, I really don't believe in PHED requirements, nobody is going to say physical education isn't bad for your health, but I don't believe in mandatory requirements like this
Sleeping is even more important, why don't we have a sleeping class then
OMG PLEASE
I would fail that class then @nobelium19
I go to sleep at 8 am and wake up at 7 pm
Ppl don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep
I went to sleep at 9 yesterday
dude u sure miss the sun
Y'all crazy, I thought going to sleep at 12am was bad
i don't keep track of my sleep anymore
cuz idk when i wake up and when i go back to sleep
now that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m out of school i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m more tired for some reason
i have never had a bedtime blame my mother
I need at least 10 hours of sleep to function normally, any less and my daily actions will be negatively impacted lol
literally even when i was like 6 the suggestion was 9:30 but that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t required
after like age 8 the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsuggestion√¢‚Ç¨ no longer existed but until i was like 16 my parents would be like üßêüßê if i was awake past 11
I sleep 15 hours a day during big holidays in school I sleep 4-6 hours a day
Yeah I can't do that lol at least not consistently
I need 4 hours to function normally
at the beginning of the school year i would get 8 hours of sleep
During fall semester, I averaged probably 5-6 hours, but spring semester I managed to get a working schedule with about 8 hours
i remember one day in june 2020 when i just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep
i was up until 5 and the sun came up and my mom was awake so i just pretended like i woke up early
omg my ex used to brag about how they were awake for like 5 days straight during the summer
I think the most I've ever gone was 3 days without sleep
like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m SORRY but that is not a flex
But 5 is way too much wtf
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve nothing to brag
they can brag about dating someone as smart as me üòé
*don't do this*
Rhode Island doesn't exist though
Isn't Rhode Island in Canada?
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t China in India?

@galavant13 what happened to the emoji movie

haters gon hate
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen all of campus yet üò¶
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it like a mile long?
Maybe it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just nicer if you have a car üò≥
@ambitiouslearner nope
Never watched either
very rough but seems about a mile
damn
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like a massive highway I dont think
Still sounds loud tho
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it rly is
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad
Anyone who thinks the east coast is better has never been to the west coast
as someone from the east coast
Washington and Oregon don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
California sucks tbh
so california doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count and washington and oregon don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
Nothing
Wdym they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
You clearly haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been to Washington
Basically, except Spokane
Spokane doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
with all cities really
i need it
Fortunately there no gentrification on the east coast cause it hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t changed in 100 years

What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong with Europe
Miss me with that American accent
Why does chat pop off only when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m away :wearycritty:
hate crime british ppl
Please don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say bri*ish without censoring it
Have we gone from city competitions to just racism?
I hate br*ts of any color
fun fact: a hate crime against a british person is not actually a hate crime; it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an act of public service!
is it hate crime if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re fictional
Sorry I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand that word
Cause they suck
because we hate the british
They sold opium to China and plunged the nation into the century of humiliation
bad night @kaori_flute
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too many tho
Wishing u a hideous day :pikakiss:
Trust me I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Oh
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any straight friends.
Even tho I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m straight üò≥
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even try to achieve this
So it seems üòî
Omg he used to have long hair
don't shoot the messenger üò†
Some were girls tho
what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that supposed to mean
oh shit sorry
shit let me delete the texts really quickly
sorry @alexthedawg
I would cut my dick off for Taiwan
If I can just rant for a sec it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so dumb how people get mad if you even say Taiwan is a separate country cause regardless of your political opinion or if you think Taiwan *should* be part of China, in the real world, it is a separate country with practical sovereignty and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dumb to pretend otherwise.
Ironically though the pro China camp are saying Taiwan should respect China√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sovereignty and literally submit themselves to Beijing
An example would be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fight China so you may as well√¢‚Ç¨
I have work tomorrow ü•≤üî´
i hope i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake up √¢¬§√Ø¬∏
The thing is that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not even what they say tho
Otherwise it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have stirred the market enough for him to issue an apology
anything that requires motor skills is a disaster for me idk why
I think it stems from a dark history within 20th century China, namely the bloody Civil War which cost the lives of nearly 10 million civilians
There was never an official armistice signed in the aftermath of the 20-year conflict, and considering that we are nowhere near the 100th anniversary of the Civil War, it's still a very touchy subject on both sides
couldn't be me
wisdom teeth removal aftercare is terrible
We pray death upon the CCP
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still in DC
stop asian hate
Omg cat
Even I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a dog person
He looks cocky tho
Zhanda wtf
@moseslee @eekhannah what happened
Unfortunately i had to
awww
Has anyone started registering for classes yet
Robin imma be honest with you I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what my major is yet
idk what üß™ means
Yeah don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know nothing about that
If class of 25 really only has one student
this feels threatening
though slightly less than the possibility of "bad night"
Wtf there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only one NY student
damn i just wanted to see if there was anyone else from my state going to case
U find anyone?
no that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s even worse please
sam you sound like someone is holding a gun to your head
someone buy me this
not me though
so far my only questions are about pepper spray and what classes i should be taking each year
bad :ban:
college kids and chemicals that cause medial issues are a bad mix
you mean case won't let me snort toluene anymore?
i want to feel safe though
at least i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find it
i mean... I did get a fucking active shooter alert in my email a few days ago
I'm not even on campus yet
neuro seems popular enough
so that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably why it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist/is hard to find
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s somewhere out there, worst case scenario try emailing a Neuro teacher and make a connection
oh nobel, is there a suggested schedul for neuro?
No I don't think so
rip
I'm scared of what computer engineering at Case is
i want the track that helps me build robots to fight off my bullies
jenin i'm literally trying to help her
find rooms
Do I actually finish both projects that are due tmr I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m working on which would take multiple hours or just turn one in that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not completely done and just finish one of them :Pepega:
everyone is a big meanie and doesn't wanna room with me
ahhh, is that the only place we need to pick them? I thought there was some more formal selection
ehh, I might find someone who was just late to setting up My College Roomie and is a perfect match
Ngl I don't know if anyone uses that website
because my mom wants me to ask
I tried to but I was too late and nobody responded
I don't use instagram, so I guess I might click with someone here
taking hannah's advice: please someone be my roommate
it's sad that no one at my previous school wanted to set up a scuttlebutt network
i feel like patio is the best place to find a roommate
Yeah can't speak on that, we didn't have Patio
someone on MCR had "don't room with me if you're under 6 foot üò§ üò© üò©"
short
both of my parents are also short it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fineeee
yea lmao i was worried
sigh
i wish i was over 170cm tall :')
Sorry but I never really got imperial system height measurements
i wish i were tall so i could stomp on people
fuck you
she turned out to be tiny
cm makes height differences seem so much more
21 but that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have anything to do with it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taller than my other sister though
to be fair to myself we have different moms
we need to cut tall people
10cm isn't too much pls :aPES_Cry:
never heard of it
guess I'll never know how tall i am
i was also slouching here because i was like 16 and i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about anything
Which one are you tho
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on the left
who ain't
no sorry i was 15 actually
just went straight from 16 to 18
Someone please put this in quotes 4 me
Idk how to cut it correctly
Oh shit he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got a gun
my kneecaps have been long gone
Tom nook stole them last year
i need to do prework for job :')
fair point
I wish
i have issues with bad keming
my phone had an alarm, and here i thought someone cared about me and called me :sadcat:
```rule #0.3: hannah is short```
vermont people are short
the worst part is i follow someone in cwru 2025 from vermont
so if i were from vermont i would have found someone from my state already
but i am still searching
what gave it away?
Idk
U feel Russian
the willingness to give some of your height to those in need
someone being a communist does not make them russian
U can guess
always leave guys who break your heart on delivered √¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏
HANNAH I WILL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART
Who broke ur heart
it was literally a year and a half ago jenin
get someone who will be as loyal to you as jenin
he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist
kinda looks like I betrayed him after earning his trust and now he's gonna kill me
oh no
first epsiode is pain though
and then someone was like "watch elfen lied" and I was never the same person
Death note is the goat
haven't watched that yet
ahhhh i can't compare animes i love them all
ope gtg bye
dorm pics. this was the one thing i wanted to see before college
even tho nobody asked: this is taplin... not great but has hot water! i like smith and taft in juniper better tho bc their communal bathrooms are nicer imo
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they have it in clarke tower
Rip
unless it is broken
oh no
sadly
carpet is the worst
I dont trust that carpet
Wtf
Fuck
yknow cold showers build character
ngl i had more problem getting cold water than hot water
I saw an article in The Atlantic a while ago called "An Ode to Cold Showers"
it can be hot and it can be cold
never really cold
yeah i dont have a minifridge üòî
i wish
talking about fridges and ice is making me hungry
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t used hot water in months
having a hot shower and finishing it with cold water in summers>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
god i remember when my hot water heater broke
then like a year later the fridge broke
happens every year at home :wobble: 
not to mention it always takes minutes to heat up
cold hot cold>>>
each shower needs to be an expedition to Antarctica
Damn
rather than showering, i strap myself to the back of a plane with a very long rope, and the plane quickly flies from the north pole to the south pole, bringing me through all temperatures of ocean water, from frigid to tropical, and back to frigid again
*imagines finn tied to a plane*
my plan was to study in the bottom of lake erie so
Rip to the one billion people who find it sacred üòî
the worst part is i didn't know where we were going
i thought we were just going to see wind turbines then we left the wind turbines and drove to the sewage treatment plant
worst experience of my life but kind of funny looking back
or conditioner sold separately?
Damn u must be smelling good
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never met my navi yet
oh shit thnx for reminding me, I still haven't done that @eekhannah
Oh now I get it
i fucking hate the financial aid people
Imagine Moses having sex tho
robin... im going to need you to hold that thought
Yes! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting bored of splitting seas so now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in uni
took away my grant funding after i reported my outside scholarships üòç
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrible
@eekhannah shh I didn't report any of my scholarships
but still sucks
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any aid or scholarship
So you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have both aid and scholarship?
I'm a first gen college student can't relate
some of mine mail the checks to me and like 2 of them send money directly to the school, unlucky my biggest ones go right to case
*and they were less than helpful when trying to get monies back*
I want that scholarship
yep p much told me to fuck off and just be rich LOL
Need money? Just dont b poor 5head
See, this is why you have to be poor
Step 1. Be poor, step 2. Don't report scholarships
NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A JOB FOR ME
but mine was too large of an amount so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s policy to send it directly to the institution so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t buy drugs or something
So it still covers the tuition but you I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the extra right?
Nah he did nothing and he is not academically strong
just tuition not room and board i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think?
He was a potential d1 soccer player but can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t play football cuz his ACL
oh it was probably that then
Bruh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still like 9k every year
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìur parents aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t helping u pay for college? that sucks, probably just be rich then√¢‚Ç¨ -case financial aid to me
@sar.hh got a paypal? I can help you pay for college
Case needs a sugar daddy club
but then ur parents cant write u off right?
nopeüòç
still looking for #2
@jarvisthepooper yo wtf
~~totally not because i'm actually extremely poor~~
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse is no one can afford a place in Hong Kong üòç
pro tip: kill your parents and inherit all their possessions. it might be enough to pay for one or two years of college!
Kill your parents then call the police
however kids, you need to be careful! if you are found to be at all responsible for your parents' death, you *will not* be able to inherit!
Bye bye college
Guys don't make money on OF
And scam ppl money by posting dog vids
I know a guy who does tho
but you don't have to be in the top 10%
Trust me I've tried lol
U are the camera man
Oh no
guberment gonna want its monies
this seems much more complicated than simply robbing a bank
dont get caught...
alright fair
cold showers slap in the summer
I would rather go to county jail for impersonation or tax evasion than federal prison for robbing a bank
Wtf
oh no
we kinda neighbors tho
oh a cutie is typing
if you get in early, you probably wont even get screwed!
Untrue, what about school lunches
idk dude u a discord pfp

I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use the word √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhate√¢‚Ç¨ very often but I fucking hate chick fil A lol
I dont like cuz only because they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re homophobic
Plenty of other chicken vendors that don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want gay people dead
Tbh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been there once
never been
never will go
isn't that just√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù nevermind
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s another fried chicken place  called raising canes but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just awful but still popular, chicken is always undercooked no matter which place I go to
Nah that shit is puke inducing
zhanda wtf

jenin i still have that guy on delivered ü§™ü§™
i hate snapchat because i like to take my time to reply to people yknow
but i find it so hard to reply to people i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not super close with
because if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reply instantly on snapchat it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kind of weird
and they know when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen their message :cri: i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have read receipts on if i have the choice because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so bad at replying
Apple AirPort√¢‚Äû¬¢ Technology

HANNAH PLS DO MY WORK

damn then what does üíñ  mean
Fuck me right now
damn
"Do you want to fuck underneath the starry night"
What happen
idk
i feel validated
i put the heart react, but I am as of yet unsure if I "want to fuck underneath the starry night"
Fuck me 4 life
Fuck me 4ever
Fuck me until I 4get everything
especially that last one
didnt' show up for bingo night
i want dihydrogen monoxide
:Sleepy:
@sir_sammy choose smith so we can play splatoon tho
I have an entire English project to die that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s due tomorrow FUN
I just finish all my school work
I was hoping somebody would notice eventually
hate playing online with ppl who don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the expansion bc I cant let my legal wife eat drink my sanity out of a bendy straw
I think it's already known that I'm a weeb
i sleepy
go sleep?
not yet omo
for anyone who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know monster prom is a competitive dating sim where you have the regular stat/relationship building functions of other dating sims but you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re playing with other people and if someone else gets to a location first you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go there
so half the time it works out and everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s chill and half the time your friend completely screws you the fuck over
idk it might be??
yeah I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t either all of my friends have a very particular type
also zoe is such an underrated gem even when we do have conflicts everyone is usually competing for the other girls and I get left alone
occasionally we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll play without the expansion and if there are enough people then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just go for one of their people just to fuck with them
listen I can't complain about getting zoe easier
fair
Wtf
there's a lot to "wtf" at
Like wtf r y'all talking abt
*is it tho?*
I've never played persona but-
damn
sorry my wifi keeps dipping
lol rip
what is this shit the full fucking length of the Jurassic period
I love the music too except for there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one palace with literally the worst song I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever listened to in a video game and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s on like a twenty second loop and I kept dying and having to restart from a mile away and it required like ten hours of on-site grinding to get through each level of the map but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fine not like I went absolutely batshit insane and almost didnt finish the game because of it :crii: :crii:
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a very large percentage of the population who plays monster prom and persona but not animal crossing
that's a very fair statement
i have never played
Go outside
go fuck your self :uniqua:
I do go outside
even video games you can't lose or get murdered in
i still get anxious
see i tried playing firewatch right but it was frustrating to play on my computer so i just gave up
i am soothed by nothing but sleep
relaxation to me is failing for 20 hours straight and then succeeding suddenly at the end
my god i was trying to fall asleep last night right
aren't we all
I god I hate when that happens
it's especially bad when it happens at school
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your body noticing your heart rate dropping too fast and checking to make sure you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dead
if I'm gonna die, just let me
i like it when my brain keeps me on my toes
I like being able to sleep
one second Im vibing in history class the next second my brain is screaming at me to stab myself in the eye with a pencil
i was in law class and i calculated the ramifications of trying to jump out the window
there were 4 in my middle school
just fucking bean me with some truly horrifying uncontrollable shit every once and a while to keep me humble
shit i forgot to water my peas
simply don't
dont b scared of the dark
be scared of whats *in* the dark
nothing
I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pay 50$ to have a garbanzo bean on my face
oh
one time i ran into my house because i heard my neighbor raking his leaves
honestly hate that shit. so glad the monsters respect my disdain for continued eye contact
to be fair i live behind some really sus apartment buildings\
but yeah fat mood
a reasonable cause for anxiety
damn
plus, i cant distract you from ur league game
5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢2 is not short
isnt it an outlier if its 2 standard deviations
what assholes are fucking that one up for us
for the last time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m telling you spider eater Dave shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be counted
this is targeted harassment jen and I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stand for it
sorry let me clarify that with commas
this is targeted harassment, jen, and I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stand for it
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need a comma after Jen
Since it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just Jen and you, no commas
kill you
you dont only use commas for lists
sorr#y my keYBOARD HA#S# A# KEY THA#T KEE#PS S#T#ICKING
well if that isn't a mood idk what is,,,,,,
Social anxiety gone wrong (sexual)
u would need to alter the sentence more if you were to go the "jen and i" route because then you will have two independent clauses separated by a comma and that is never fun
Wtf is sexual anxiety?
david you want that A
im already getting a few Bs prob bc I turned in a half completed project in econ and wont be studying for the ap stats or ap physics final :KEKW:
welp looks like I need to make sure to skip a day here and there, dont want that happening

case students aren't gamers
I play CS to relax tho
i play video games bc reality sucks :Pepega:

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think chris evans is that attractive
damn
also who the fuck is Chris Evans
not chris though
Lmao that ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t real
I won't even get smith now üò¢
i actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find too many celebrities attractive
i find so many female celebrities attractive but hardly any male celebrities
I ain't gay but $20 is $20 you feel me?
celebrities in general just don't do it for me
been like that for past few hours üòÇ
that seems like a tough predicament
not really
things i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to air publicly yet still do check ü•∞ü•∞
bad
this is a school server why am i sharing so many personal details someone stop me
holding in shit ain't fun either
see the worst part is i DO talk about all of this with a friend already
what i need is a therapist
go fix that
attractive but not my type. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like long hair
*nope*
I like short hair on girls and it doesn't remind me of guys
damn
I ain't dumb, my friends have an iq of 130
those don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work lol
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no real point in taking an iq test unless something seems to be abnormal about the noggin
turns out I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty smart but can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t focus for the life of me :KEKW:
how much you got left?
unfortunately this is not an easy fix
90% of it left
when it due?
this is all i got so far
nope
not really even following rubric really
fair
Infographic wasnt a project option :KEKW:
its what I did for the last project in this class so why not do it again
but instead of doing 1 infographic do 2 so it seems like it's a lot of info
but I was familiar with the website that I used to make the infographic and didnt want to do something new bc Im lazy
ah fair
like 2ish weeks left of school of senior year and they expect me to work??
i need to submit my speech tomorrow man
i just hate criticism and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m terrified of my principal telling me i need to change things
nope
just turn it in so late that they cant have you change anything
yeah i think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s good but i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t offend anyone in my school district and idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s walking that line
you wont see them
some girl who was valedictorian in texas still did that talked about abortion rights a few days ago instead of her real speech
or they wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t release my final transcript, i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have to serve 40 hours detention, and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d write a letter to case asking them to rescind my acceptance
if its a public school
they cant do any of that
*they cant legally*
i have no rage though
the salutatorian wants to call people out :blurryeyes:
`Schools can't deny a diploma to qualified graduates... If a student successfully finished the academic requirements and sat for final exams, courts find it unfair for schools to withhold a high school diploma for last-minute disciplinany actions`
rob the school
no they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t withhold my diploma
because they will tell case to rescind if i do anything bad
the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìoffensive√¢‚Ç¨ part is thanking my fourth grade teacher for making me feel smart for the first time and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared my previous teachers will take offense
everyone who wants to control people uses it
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t address the class until the fourth paragraph
my dad let me drive into someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s yard what do you think kinda parents they are
they still used it
its easy and effective when people dont think they have power
should i start my speech with √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgood evening, class of 2021√¢‚Ç¨ i just think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s boring i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
i started with a quote that i absolutely rip to shreds
boring
absolutely SHIT on the school
If they cut your mic just start giving people the bird
not someone DMing me and asking me to sell my discord account to them for $500 :KEKW:
all bc of the "Early Supporter" badge I have
wouldn't even do it for $5k tbh
oh my

the worst part is that I choose this 7:30/8 am shift
oh yeah I didn't get the cafe job :KEKW:
they decided i wasnt male or christian enough to work at the ymca
I texted them after the interview and they didn't respond at all but then like yesterday I got a text from them saying I didnt get a job :KEKW:
actually i just decided i couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be trusted with others√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ children following my wisdom teeth surgery because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to get that this summer
realized the mistake they made
Do internationals need to pay taxes?
if you work in the usa
Sigh
I was hoping I could commit tax fraud
nothing is stopping you
isnt that just called quitting
but i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t started working yet
you need a cleanse
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to work at dunkin
I absolutely hate myself and my adhd, already broke something I got today :CB_sadge:
i thought you said you were quitting tho
if they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hire me idk what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll do because that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the only thing within walking distance
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drive
normally you want to put in a 2 week notice tho if you want a like a good review from your employer if future employers ever want to talk to them
but i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t started working yet
is it really quitting if i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t started working yet
didnt you say you work for ymca tho
then put in the 2 weeks notice now :P
or if they havent filled out the paperwork, just call them and say ur plans have changed
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even given them my payment info
then they havent done the paperwork yet
i have given them my ssn though
nvm dont ghost them
so they dont steal your identity
but i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t guarantee that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get directly in contact w my supervisor if i call
if you want it done quickly, no
plus, if you cant do this, you need to learn how to do this now
but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need him to have a good opinion of me
never be r00d if you can help it
the manager at my ymca knew the head of the school distric and some buisness ceos
you never know who people might kno
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to do the paperwork and i have to get teeth removed

APs are still going on?
the IB was also fucked up; they decided who takes the exams and who doesn't by throwing darts at a world map

I'd imagine it to be worse if I didn't speak English
other than that, it's okay in some aspects and bad in others
your neighbors all hate you
Why do your neighbors hate you
my house neighbors don't really hate me thankfully, and my country neighbors hate us (and we're supposed to hate them) because the balkans in the early 1900s were what the middle east is now, geopolitically
i woke up an hour ago

tired and hungry
I don't like rice cookers
my dad is a chef and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like rice cookers
never used a rice cooker
My body doesn't react too well to them
The perfection just makes it boring
Which I don't know if even counts as cooking rice
Still saucepan rice
No risotto will come out fully cooked, but takes much longer
That's why risotto comes out shiny, rice cooker or saucepan rice doesn't
Never straight A
U miss hs?

I will, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m studying abroad at a school that one of my teachers will be getting their Masters and PHD at and teach at üíÄ
My gov teacher is like the sibling I wish I could have, wish I could trade my brother for her
His dad is a student of his mum in hs

my dad, a 22 year old father, started dating my mom, a 30 year old divorcee :cursed_flushed:
my half sister was 2 months old when my parents started dating
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mum that
not *yet*
*call someone a milf*
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think young ppl go there
my backup plan if this whole doctor thing doesn't work out is to become a trophy wife
though i dont think im trophy wife material
Then we split the money
Shit is getting real
The school paid for meü•∫
i go to a public school and the secretary paid for 1/4 of my cap and gown

we're still searching
just wanted to clarify it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rice purity o.O
oh so you have 89
sorry to anyone with 11s
looks like I need to go do stuff
So I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking I need to get both scores at a 30
wasn't one of the questions "have you showered with someone of your preferred gender(s)?"
1 hour and 17 minutes until i cause trouble inside my high school
My brother will probably have a rice purity score lower than mine
he does worse stuff
He needs :monkaCHRIST:
We do but he hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done that.... hopefully :cursed_flushed:
i don't want to fill out the rice test because i don't want to think about my sins
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it tomorrow or am I dumb
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in four hours
Well that would have been bad :kekW: What an absolute dumbass I am

that just sounds terrible
I could have taken Calc bc last year but decided I want an easy Calc class last year (Calc ab) lmao
senior pranks are not allowed at my school
it has happened
im dum they are at mine too
we just dont take both, we go straight from honors precalc to calc bc
ah I went from honors PreCalc to Calc AB bc I wanted to
i could only go from honors precalc to calc ab. no bc at my school
I should have taken it last year but wanted an easy A in Calc AB
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember üòÇ
Is anyone actually considering going straight into calc 3 freshman year bc that sounds awful
idk units my teacher is insane
Im taking calc again cus i dont know it really
Like I can get a 5  I think but I wont actually know it
FUCK i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hide all the mini babies
i have 4 left
The problems take so goddamn long
I take like 15 minutes to do problems
ya i didnt know all the integrals for the trig functions but i sitll think i did really well on ap test
i mean worst comes to worst you can always integrate by parts on a quotient
On my lastpractice test I got literally every single integration question wrong
idk how to do subscripts in discord, if you even can

euler's method is fun if the numbers arent too complicated
holy shit math in general? Go touch grass
Math ü§¢ ü§Æ
+1 even tho im physics major
am i the only one who enjoys math here
i hate simple math i like complicated math
Series were awful never mention those again
series is pain
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m awful at simple math but good at complicated math üòÇ
please dont ever say this again
yea like the more complex math you take the more you have to use a calculator to do basic math
same i got a  B in all lower math classes and finally got an A in calc lmfao
i got As in all my honors math classes until 2nd sem calc bc when i finally got an H
Lower class math it proves u are a upperclassman
I got 100% almost the entire year in calc bc :cursed_flushed:
I meant like math lower than calc
Im not calling that math like "low class" or whatever
I hate math so math is lower class
Math is not pog
isnt it like a 63% is still a 5 or smth like that?
As a CS major I have to take way too many math classes for me to actually like math
I dont trust my score
math is epic and based
Damn we have a DS major
Math is the best subject
oh lala?
Fuck around in Math 224 and if you skip a section of the test you get a 30%
might double major in cognitive science tho idk yet
don't listen to @bravo5127
i tried ap chem this year, last unit totally kicked my butt
Sociology is applied Psychology is applied biology which is applied chemistry which is applied Physics which is applied math which is applied philosophy
Chem is the worst science
Bio is cool but I could never acvtually study it
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you need to take data structures then?
preferably never
all the other shit was just like
i hate cells
yeah fuck cells, why cant i just be made of metal or something
I will never go premed

Can you reserve a room if your roommate hasn't completed the housing app yet?

Bored
egregiously bored
ive been incredibly bored the past few weeks
bad
ive been neglecting my responsibilities (studying etc) but im still bored
I need a routine
i went from college straight to an airbnb with the boys in the smokey mountains
and its lame
@denoris want to know my routine?
Idk what ur talking about
im so bad at integrals
i suck at thgem tho
Esa's are hard to approve anymore
Additionally if you get sick or hurt then your emergency contact has to take care of the animal
For instance a girl had an esa dog and ended up in the hospital and had her emergency contact as her mom who lived about 8 hours away and so the dog couldn't be let out because RAs aren't allowed to randomly key into rooms, and the barking and going to the bathroom does a lot of harm
cat dont caare
that hasnt been my username for like
Clarke isn't bad tbh
I mean, how many people are sitting here waiting
gee a year has passed
Moses don't reveal that
thats ok, i will absolutely shit on physics (despite having taken it in high school)
bruh I can't do sh*t
So close tho...
since ur a dog
Isn't taft the best?
bruh its been 6 fucking minutes and all the juniper options are gone @denoris
that fucking sucks
we're facing north so we won't be getting any sunlight lol
im so mad at myself i spent so much time fretting over which rooms we both had that i totally blew our only shot at taft
jen is so mad at me
rip to my roomate

ROBIN OMG
NO DONT
I wish I got juniper üò¢
U WONT GET ONE THO
you cant withdraw and get juniper all the juniper rooms ewere literally gone in 60 seconds
rip
i had the audacity to keep refreshing to find a room facing east
i was supposed to be in cutter 207
sigh
oh no
He didn't even do his housing app
and he was supposed to be my roommate
oh big big rip
Ugh just failed to get into the same building as someone
Are all the Taft taken? Because I never saw any
all of juniper is gone
And never saw it
Juniper is all gone
sorry mate
Will they open more Juniper on Monday, possibly?
was going for a corner but all the windows face the wrong way so :/
i hit refresh at exactly 12:00 but never saw taft
i saw cutter and smith but never taft
I never saw Cutter
Cutter is really good tho
clarke is suite tho so if yoiu dont want to live in a suite dont choose clarke
I really want to withdraw
but I'm too scared I will end up somewhere fucking trash
hitchcock doesnt deserve it
'm assuming thats the worst one?
are the first floors for smith taken?
his single is like 5k tho
You just better hope that you have competent roommates so that the fire alarm doesn't go off randomly
i hate myself
wtf how do you  set the fire alarm off by cooking
Happened to Tyler a couple of times if I recall, one time they all came into Norton because it was cold outside ü•∂
cooking is easy, ive never burned anything üòé
But i ain't deep frying stuff
Not my year, but apparently the year before in Norton House, the fire alarm went off 4 times in the span of 2 weeks
Oh fuck
happened in juniper too
You fucking kidding me.
that haven't been filled
aka shit rooms
i need confirmation
lotta people with dorm opinions who've never been in a dorm :thonk:
Yeah it has to be decent cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in mistletoe too smh
what do you want to know?
Should I have tried little more aksheobciejskd
the fact that my first choice popped up and i was too slow
Oh shit we got a bath and toilet
idk if it's the same for everything but osu has different layouts
Me too üòî was too slow
Imagine having more than an absolutely tiny room, couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
9x10 room tho
when does that happen
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re really small
that sucks
I just realized juniper is first year only
@hjonk12 I saw that shit
i wouldve taken like any juniper double
except for i didnt get the otpion
I just fucking realized
all my options were bad
that I've been looking at the wrong norton house
We don't have a bathroom
i still don't understand all these ters
No air conditioning
dont think so
Dw well all die from heat
man that sucks
won't need it during the winter so
its only half a year of suffering
did i just accidentally choose worst building
Clarke 8th floor was kinda a banger floor tho ngl
probably the worst
u have good north side food options still tho
Clarke singles are not bad
this is why i'll study in the library
I had a double and it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the worst thing since I was alone
fuck you, Mary Castle Norton
not even a room
that sucks
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not the worst
hey @howdy_. why cant i @ my own role
cuz
i want wherever you are
That is a fate worse than death
already at the last stage of grief
no fr all my other options were doubles in like the worst buildings
so ig a single in clarke is not that bad
College dorms aren't mansions folks. You've gotta realize this.
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really not the worst if those were ur options ^
lowkey expensive but only doing it cause of the FAT scholarship
my mom would have never agreed otherwise
bro no i got shit financial aid
they gave me like nothing
if i didnt get this scholarship i could def not afford
awkward, somehow it ended up being cheaper than my local state school o.o
@kaori_flute IM TRYING TO FIND MY FUCKING UNO EMOTE BUT I JUST REMMEBERED I DONT HAVE NITOR ANYDMORE
im thinking fairy lights tho
i rarely use them anymore
I have colorful computer peripherals
I have very little patience for people who shit on the university and sit in their dorm and cry about there being nothing to do when in fact there is plenty and they're just too damn elitist or whatever else to go get to know their city.
as long as u dont get a bad one ur ok
I CAN HAVE FREEDOM TO USE MY PC LATE AT NIGHT
@toomanyzs ngl last semester it was unironically hard to be happy even while actively trying to do things
WITHOUT MAKING A ROOMATE MAD
corona really fucked my entire mental up
Covid doesn't count
I'm not creative at all so I'll need help
you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know for a while probably? I think?
idk mine was just in my suite
NO LEAGUE THO
i won't be in taplin next semester :LAUGHING:
@.bugcatcapoo I'm gonna want to see that :p
damn

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m cracked on 1.7 pvp, I used to grind kohi and badlion

i think i've had enough of this room
i tried league

11 months in here
imma miss it
and valorant since beta
ah i dont like wynncraft
alll my friends play tho
9 months
u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to use elevator
elevator situstion in clarke sucked last semester
I wonder how far the fitness center is away from the dorms
oh i think ik who lived in 202 :evilclap:
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll all be lifted tho
ya i still dont wanna live w someone thats cringe
i dont trust other people
Okay so here are some things about dorm life: 
1. No bedtimes, no lights out, no curfews. 
2. Quiet hours start at 11pm and that's just don't be blasting music 
3. In non covid you can sleep anywhere for 3 days that's not your room per week, and you can have people from anywhere in your room.
4. RAs check once per semester for.health and safety inspections, and aside from us and our master key, not a single other person than the people in the dorm have that key. Not even the police can key in without us.
5. Single person bathrooms are in every dorm on the first floor. If you're a shy pooper, go use those. 
6. The mattresses are actually pretty comfortable, and I have slept for 3 years and 2 summers on them without really any back pain or anything. 
7. Housekeeping will clean the bathrooms, take out the trash in the hallways, etc, but you're responsible for your room.
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll never have to have a roomate roomate
and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so happy that I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think my room ever got checked
looking to find a room
monday
rip cameron
damn
OH
Except clark
They're asleep in the room??/
i would certainly hope u would notice someone on your fucking floor
oh
or someone fucking on your floor
Somebody didn't agree to them having a guest in their room all night and so they text me
ngl I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hear anyone banging the entire semester
sometimes it was annoying as shit!
I knew a grand total of 0 people that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t violate the covid rules post getting vaccinated

imagine being in a dorm that isnt named for Mary Castle Norton (1854-1928). Her father was the mayor of Ohio City and had the honor of becoming the first mayor of the united city of Cleveland after the two cities combined the year of her birth. Norton busied herself in the cultural and philanthropic life of the emerging industrial metropolis, serving as president of the Church Home for the Aged and Friendless, Chair of the Board of Lady Managers of Lakeside Hospital and a board member of the Cleveland Institute of Music.
I really need to update that profile picture, it's horrible

Navigator meeting in 7 hrs üëç
Looks like a majority of folks were able to snag juniper rooms
I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be picky just wanted a juniper one lol especially smith/taft/taplin
What does it mean when it says I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in cutter house 401?
No I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t change it anyway
ah4th floor not even bad
at least on the 4th floor ppl arent opening doors to the outside all the damn time
*all the floors will succ, but the 4th floor doesnt have to deal w/ the flooding or roaches, so thats a plus*
bad annie
They won't even let us bring our own acs
Who is tyler and why did my dad leave me
I wish they added just a few more rooms to the third floor
Me too I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open my eyes
Back to sleep gn
I couldn't close my eyes ee
i am going to my school in an hour

@eekhannah idk what ur talking about
I'm gay tho
Woke up 15 minutes late for my Stats final rn üôÉ
*oh no*
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not *that tired*
yeah but what's the fun in taking a final without 5 hour energy?
I just need to get a 22-25% to get a B in the class no point in aiming for an A if I have to get an 88% üòÇ
88% doesn't sound too bad
shouldn't you be taking the final rn tho?
not AP test but yeah won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be getting a 5 on the one next week either  üòÇ
Ope gl on that one tho I feel like the one on 5/17 wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad
all i remember about the stats exam was opening up the frq packet to 5 pages of normalCDF
I have a knack for waking up just in time to check in for each online class then falling back asleep again
welp idk what i was doing during that exam lmao
*sets alarm for 6:15 so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss my exam at 7:00... turns off alarm and accidentally falls back asleep and wakes up 15 minutes after exam begins* :KEKW:
yep we were able to choose them last night
less than 12 hours ago
i could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had more juniper but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really read i just took it
i had missed 2 tafts and then got the taplin
we had to put down our housing preferences, and we hear back what room we get in July or so
not my dad calling me and asking if I have school today... at 9am lmfao like yeah dad I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m IN school rn
my mom just went "are you still doing school downstairs" as I was busy doing school downstairs
"r u in school? This guy on the operating table definitely isn't."
Aren't those metal

@eekhannah just finished my English project that is due 9 hours ago ü•∞
the door stopper is taped to the wall because I used it as a homemade fidget spinner üíÄ
Because I thought it was funny that it was loose and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize it was gonna fall off the wall

Cuz there's a deadline for u to upload vax cards, so they can plan next sem's policy
yep a deadline, anyone who hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten vaxxed will just pass away instantly after the deadline
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to pass away the deadlines in 15 minutes and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sitting here waiting for them to call me
time to zone out *so hard* during school ceremonies
idk what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m meant to do. i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve finished my speech i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done everything. do i just pass away now
it was from my school√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s english department. i thought it was an award i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize they give money
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time to pass away
cuz it can get to over 30C in your room
i have a feeling a weighted blanket would be problematic for me
i'm working
Why I feel that u hate ur step bro
@jarvisthepooper I have it as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìstepbrother√¢‚Ç¨ as it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not technically my stepbrother as we aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t related and my dad isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t married

that's too bad
I've been procrastinating for weeks
sorry i was sleep
did you get married yet
Nope :(
anyone want to do a jigsaw puzzle? https://jigsawpuzzles.io/g/d114b56a-8603-4c38-93fb-6864b567838f
i was telling my sister how hot the dorms could get and she said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìit can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be that bad; it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the midwest√¢‚Ç¨ ü•¥
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that it will
Case doesn't have AC either, which only exacerbates the problem lol
see her dorms didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have ac either but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rhode island temps are p mild
even if you think that, my sister still attends the university of rhode island
He probably left discord, so you think it's not him
Still at the wedding reception and my family sat me next to someone completely hammered who won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop talking and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an introvert :cursed_flushed:
oh no
My class only has 41 dudes
imagine having high school friends of the same gender couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me :cursed_flushed:
They were trying to pull me out of my chair
@eekhannah need you to drive down from Vermont and help me
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drive and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not from vermont
I guess I wish I had more guy friends but idk lol
In other news, I do not have a boyfriend. Because I am not attracted to men. That's really the reason why
Weren't you the one who can't decide
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so
nope
Wtf is ur school doing
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called being gay and being uncomfortable near guys
Even my school is catholic
main reason was bc I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to wake up an hour earlier in order to get there in time
Some ppl in my school travel 1.5 hrs every morning to my school
Yea it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tired asf
I've heard that all else being equal, longer commute times will lead to unhappiness
U can identify them without any clues
People want to live closer to school
I'm assuming that houses near DC cost more
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sue I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be a bad parent
Cuz DC has a very dense population
Cuz I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consider schools nearby before I get a house
Then I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it will be as unique as single gender
not all girls she was just like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi wish i could send you to catholic school√¢‚Ç¨ like i still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t told her that i do not believe in catholicism :cursed_flushed:
i was more skeeved out over the fact that she wanted to send me to a religious school
Wikipedia says it used to be called the murder capital of the USA :cursed_flushed:
i told my mom multiple times that i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go to a catholic college and she kept suggesting it
Ik someone parents like that
did not want to go to a school whose mascot is a friar
When I told my uncle that I was applying to colleges he started listing super conservative college that I should apply too üíÄüíÄüíÄ
notre dame is kinda a banger school tho
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a Jesuit college
i wanted to apply to gtown though tbh
was the only exception to my √¢‚Ç¨≈ìno religious schools√¢‚Ç¨ rule but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end up doing it
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even catholic
i wish that she had at least once asked me what i wanted yknow
it was always just. a given which is what pissed me off
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m far less expressive than my sister; i share a lot less (which is why i tend to share a lot online, sorry) and i wish she understood that two different kids are different kids yknow
i prefer to just say i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a religion
Cuz he drank?
oh no
my mom tries to pressure me to drink üëç i want not
my mom is like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhy don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you have a drink to build up your alcoholic tolerance for college√¢‚Ç¨ like idk who she thinks i am
Wrong hannah sorry
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 18 sorry i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they care
girl got me worried real quick
sorry we have the same name and that zhanda is incompetent
Idk
I have to be at the gym tomorrow at like 7am and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s about an hour drive home üíÄ
taking a 3 hour nap was either a good choice or a bad one
mac is asleep now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s BEDTIME
i sleepy
honestly wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t *that* bad
@sir_sammy have u tried oat milk
oh that concorsation was literally hours ago
It tastes like nothing
because almonds are so fucking awful to farm
Im a fiend I need to have soy milk hidden from me
Honestly tho understandable
I still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t figured out what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m intolerant to but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s definitely something but we aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sure bc it seems to always change like one day I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m intolerant to eggs, the next day cheese, like my body can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick
wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be surprised already have so many issues :cursed_flushed:
me when I step my ankle wrong and it displaces itself
isn't it like 4am in the US?
nevermind not getting breakfast with my buddies because one buddy can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come √¢¬¨‚Ä¶√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ä†Àú√Ø¬∏√¢≈æ¬°√Ø¬∏√¢¬¨‚Ä°√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ä†‚Äî√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ä†‚Ñ¢√Ø¬∏√¢‚Ä†‚Ñ¢√Ø¬∏
I should be awake two hours from now
Pain
shhh don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell howdy
oh
I'm familiar with the concept, but still fascinating
that's bad :/
1.2 is 0.2 away from being indistinguishable
sorry, not indistinguishable. unreadable
*oh*
**oh**
you're correct. this is why I didn't take visual arts as a major
Nor did I, i just used to draw a lot when i was younger (still do occasionally)
reminds me of that tumblr post where people argued about color theory in regards to a children's hospital renovation
That's so .. terribleüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
completely ignoring the fact that it *looks like someone dragged a body into a room then out of it*
A bloody body
Especially since this is a HOSPITAL????
that's too large of a bloody streak for a child
sorry but it had to be observed
Wrong green
i'm light blue and yet it still looks green
I never got the appeal of starbucks drinks that are like, made then and there
I feel rather the opposite
but if you go to caffeinate, I don't get the appeal
I've never been to the US
no, I'm Macedonian - I've just been to Starbucks in Hungary once
500 bucks doesn't cut it huh?
so it isn't just for starbucks
yeah sadly starbucks would be a luxury
i say sadly cuz.. need money to survive cuz capitalism
didn't neeko, that girl that was like "tax the rich", recently get a muy expensive mansion?
tax the rich tho
i heard that a lot of students were caught cheating in the AP CS exam
what applies for games applies for exams, too
oh damn
Alaska is one hour behind the West Coast and Hawaii is 3 hours behind
honourlock is the worst thing out there
even tho it costs more than the lockdown broser
and do you mean "the worst thing out there" in detection accuracy, or in consequences for cheaters?
it;s just annoying
You lost 10 minutes and still got a higher score than the rest of us üß†
Hate to say this but still an overpriced milkshake right
unfortunately not
I never said today :bob:
oh :xCrittyx:
They open Thursday to Saturday
i prolly can't next thursday :LAUGHING:
not *yet*
My summer goal of "getting a driver's license" so far has no progress
I need to learn how to drive because there probably won't be widespread usage of autonomous passenger cars in 3 years when I graduate
I don't, officially, have a driver's license
I don't either lol
americans seem to all know how to drive by the time they're 16
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get my lisemce until the summer after I turned 17
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a license
I don't either
Once we graduate we need licenses though
was going to this summer then realized how little time i have
I don't think 30+ is horribly expensive for a new car
In Ohio you can get your permit at 15.5, hold it for 6 months, then drive at 16.
If you're say, a teacher and make 45k a year even with a degree, then you'd be very wrong
$40k isn't cheap at all
Car payment should only take up 20% of your monthly income
Car payment should be 10% take home pay and 10% of take home pay for expenses, so to afford a 6 year loan on a 40 thousand dollars car means you have to make 65k a year and have perfect credit
on death and dying by e kubler ross
This is absolutely right, my parents both have advanced degrees and have never been able to afford this type of luxury combined with children, house payments, medical bills etc.
A 40 thousand dollars brand new car is a horrible investment anyway. Over the course of that 5 or 6 year loan the depreciation will gut you
True. Even if you're making enough money to afford a Model 3 ($65k as you estimated), it's probably a better idea to buy a cheaper car and save/invest the money you saved.
My library doesnt have that :(
Vehicles r horrible investments
If you want a good cry "When breath becomes air"
I swear my library has so many books but never the ones I want
highly recommend asking if your library uses libby or a similar service
A lot of branches won't have a big selection of books, so if you want specific books, I've found that I often have to request them from other branches
I havent read an e book in forever
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve read a ton of stuff on libby
instagram has gone crazy
A grad gift from my school
Wtf
car payment should **not** be 20%
what about the entire car costing 25% of one year√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s salary
and 3 years isnt even that long
How much better is a 50k or 75k car compared to a 25k car though?
theres no reason to buy a car that costs over 30k unless youre rich
These words are coming from a person who supports bringing a car on-cAmpus, despite the fact that you will have a seldom need for one
You don't need a car on-campus as a freshman
yea a car is unnecessary as a freshman
(leases tho)
idek what it means to lease a car for 3 years
whatever your mom is doing seems like a waste of money tho
Basically renting the car for 3 years
and renting a new car
The car is the one thing she really spends money on for herself and tbh it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad bc she makes enough money to easily afford doing it
sorry lad
Shut the fuck up microaggressive finn
zhanda do i need to block you again
i feel like youre worse than ever zhanda
oh
@.fim. well she only spends like 8% or so of her salary a year on a car so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad.
earlier today I think
just don't get a car
The cars aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t *that* expensive

If anyone is bored and wants to help me with a jigsaw puzzle, here is the link: https://jigsawpuzzles.io/g/03d34422-615b-42a3-bbb8-692e558991aa
Is it the one if u don't work together and solve it
U die
Oh gl
sleepy
tired
I haven't slept since yesterday
I want to fix my sleep schedule
Tired after even sleeping 12 hours last night
Granted I did go to six flags yesterday so that may have been why I felt so tired
fair
honestly feeling tired after an eventful day is the best
It really is
it's been so long since I've rode a rollercoaster :0
The lines weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad and they were running everything at half capacity because of severe understaffing
and hope it isn't miserably hot out
Ya it was like 85 on Friday but with water it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad and we planned our water rides well
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what time. not midnight.
there is still only 1 student
i just want to find the people from my state. all i want. just let me do this.
sad day for hannah
big sad, my roommate lives like an hour away from me :cursed_flushed:
We can both suffer in the cold together
I don't know anybody else from Vermont that goes here
if i were from vermont i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already found someone in co25
following yourself doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count :cursed_flushed:
~~i would not have picked her if we did not have the same political views i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry~~
Are they near Houston?
In texas don't you have to own a shotgun and 10 gallon hat by law
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even been to ohio
i won't kill u
pog 40 mins by car
my mom wants to go
i just need to let her know i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m down yknow
gonna hide that, the flashing is annoying :cursed_flushed:
Oh yeah I forgot, My mom√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s best friend√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dad graduated from Case Institute of Technology :cursed_flushed:
It's not a bad school at all
Oh üòÇ
my optometrist had heard of case but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know it was in cleveland
It's not bad but it's not that well known. I'm guessing that part of that is because we're not known for sports
When you have a med school that is attached to the #2 ranked hospital in the country that happens
would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never applied if i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get those emails tbh
without collegeboard i would not be here
without collegeboard I would be here :KEKW:
You can't get better than the Clinic for heart stuff
my college advisor told me to apply to case and I was like huh what never heard of that school and why are you telling me to apply somewhere so far and cold lmao
you're far and cold
not further than Boston schools tho
so I guess distance wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that big of a factor tbh
distance wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a big factor for me
though a lot of my schools were quite close
I'm late to the convo, but k was getting a COVID test yesterday and my doctor was impressed i got into case
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìüòÇüíÄü•∞√¢‚Ç¨ on iPhone and √¢‚Ç¨≈ì:cursed_flushed: :KEKW: :This: on discord
i got ü•∞üòÉü§™ on iphone
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually expect a response.... especially not one so fast :cursed_flushed:
tbh idk
feel that Hannah lol
Idk I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like cutting people out unless you bully me into leaving a middle school, then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll hate U forever :cursed_flushed:
i was planning on breaking up with my ex before going to college anyway, just happened 2 happen a year and a half earlier
just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be with someone that lacks ambition
Oh turns out my ex-best friend from middle school is gay now too :cursed_flushed:
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been friends with one of my best friends since 6th grade and now we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re both bisexual :cursed_flushed: which we established without telling eachother
But it turned out well for me I ended up switching to a small private middle school then going to the same high school as her and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to a better college than her so :ope:
@eekhannah not a tiny part of me hoping that my ex didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t respond so my mom could feel bad and give me the money I spent on the ticket üíÄüíÄ
dead
I was like welllll $130 wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a bad alternative :cursed_flushed:
my bank account is trying to fight me gonna call the bank tmw ig
my bank account is mad at me rn :cursed_flushed:
oh mines more mad
probably because i tried to deposit a $1000 check
my bank doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me overdraft at all lol
Mines not supposed to let me
they just enabled a thing with student accounts so that i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t overdraft at all
I wish i had a limit :cursed_flushed:
Prob will tmr morning tho so I have money to get food at universal but I prob should ask my mom for money for food bc I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have enough lmao
I need to wake up in 6 hours :cursed_flushed:
He wants to smash???
@legendsexile my bank account isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mad at me anymore
I don't know any other greetings
fair
I did start using Google cuz, i forgot slme
ah yeah, thatw as my first guess but i was afraid i was wrong
It took us 6 hours last when we were in Florida
omg i just had a car parade for graduation and it was sm fun
Almost missed a turn :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed:
:Sleepy:
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not where near ready yet üò©üò©
i think i have too much stuff for being 2 months away i think
at college and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not just a 10 month sleep over
ngl it still feels like a sleep over
for clarification i have never visited campus ü§™ so i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going 3 weeks before move in
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going on august 13th and I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t visited üò®
My bad
no i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m visiting july 23 + 24, leaving on the 25th then arriving again on august 14
wtf
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that much money jeffrey
Whaaaaaaa, you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have $4000 offhand????? Plebian ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Cops can track the money after u rob
U need to do money Laundry after that
But they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t track a Cong üòéüòéüòéüòé
Annoying
> the bi represents the heavens.

damn, good to know we're divine :fingerguns:
If u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t earn it rob it
cuz zach is a tyler RA
oh!
because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake up
it is one that shakes you awake
oh
you pay me $60 per academic year to do the same job
oh
i think that would disturb my roommate though
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make noise it just shakes
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read
sorry, I did sidetrack it. $60 is an okay price for an alarm clock that makes no noise
putting the alarm away from bed: failed
away + have to do math: failed
Just use your phone as an alarm clock
my phone *doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake me up*
Sorry, CCP orders
and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to get it myself
if it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work on me ~~i can just return it~~
He was my resident last year and now he's an RA
*I've been moved into my room for 3 weeks almost*
the US embassy is not letting up about giving out visas due to COVID and with each passing day I fear more and more about having to defer to spring 2022
yeah. I might even try to go to a US embassy in a different country if they don't get their shit straight by july
@_zacc you said I don't need to take mechanical engineering classes for a compeng major
they're required for the computer engineering major
here's hoping
meaning it needs the general engineering requirements
I'm so sleepy I read this as "volk" in cyrillic
iirc 200 is ez, 210 is die, and 225 is medium
Oh rip
fuck transient, all my homies steady state
The guy who used to teach it also taught this sages that was about cheating in sports and I wanted to take it so badly
well its basically do you want to get shafted by doing just math for four years or get shafted by doing math and other stuff too
yeah data science is just math
If a class is too easy, you won't learn much
a pointlessly difficult class is just stupid
oh no
who's made u sad hannah
Did I miss anything?
Bye
It's so cursed when u can read Russian but doesn't know a word
Wrong hannah
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m serious
i'm also serious
suspectable i guess :xCrittyx:
ur not missing out :LAUGHING:
*not yet*
is it a bad choice to visit case 3 weeks before move in :blurryeyes: :blurryeyes:
i don't have a deadline :D
Oh shit it's only 7.5 hours to NYC
It's only 6 hours to baltimore/DC
going to go insane being in a car with my mom for ten hours but that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fine :)
I want to see Logan Paul die
And i still expect mayweather to rock his shit
the fact that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll only see one new state going to case and it is ohio is so sad
advice required: study for aps, or dont?
or are you still gonna take the intro classes
so i cant skip the aps sadly
i would say study either way bcz it's gonna be easier if you're gonna take the intro classes
oh wrong chat
OH PREMED
there are so many boxes in my room please help i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m drowning in cardboard
am i really a sophomore
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s some mad BS
could be worse, levi
Why are you already packing tho? Are you international?
*much worse*
if my plans don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fall thru
What happened...? Do I even want to know
i mean, whether or not u want does not matter bcz i'm too lazy to explain
I feel like burning yourself on hot glue guns is the difference between physics and engineering
shit is fire
I've been so bad at watching movies lately üò© gotta get back into the groove
I used to watch his lectures until i stopped
Something put me off but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t quite put my finger on it
I'm so fucking sad that I only have 1 year left of normal college
because my second shot isn't due for another week so its not like i could've submitted my half vaccination card
oh bitch
fuck
i can still submit it anyway so there are more submissions though, right?
just wont win the 500
do it if you're able to
skipping my 3 ap tests this week since I really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care if I have to retake the classes√¢≈ì≈í√Ø¬∏
seems like it @longlong2575
would rather retake the classes in college for an easier A than go into a harder level class after a covid class
or study for them so that the As are easier
Couldn't you just take even easier 101 gen eds instead of harder level classes?
idk?
like instead of taking MATH 223 he retakes 126
does it work
idk i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to try it
i just tested it and it is certainly annoying
Kinda on an unrelated note but I have my alarm set to go off and play Academic Festival Overture, actually not a bad piece for an alarm
the money i spent on it is still pending in my bank account
won't work anymore tho :LAUGHING:
Just picked up my cap and gown for graduation, apparently I get to wear like a gold stole with it bc of graduation with distinction or magna cum laude prob both idk lol
I do, well used to but still have hundreds of cards
Hot damn thats alot of cards.
I feel those
That feeling when you have 10 1/1 soldiers
A parent I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen in like 10 years recognized my name when I was picking up my cap and gown. :cursed_flushed: apparently she knows someone who goes to cwru who is in their second year, think the name was Antonio and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s premed lmao
Felt weird bc I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember her at all
Oh lmaoooo
haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t played since I quit scouts :KEKW:
fair
damn i havent played mtg in so long
Just finished  my first session with personal trainer and I have never been more dead
RIP
Oh
too late, it has already hit the presses
my brain wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t working, seems I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read rn
@eekhannah can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see that :cursed_flushed: üíÄ
dead
wtf did it say at first
supposedly took like 4 courses that get me an extra certificate but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know which four courses those are
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking it has something to do with me taking maybe like Engineering Design, AP Comp Sci, and maybe like AP Physics classes or maybe AP math classes. As it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called √¢‚Ç¨≈ìComputer Survey Award√¢‚Ç¨
I'm suffering trying to find good connection in new mexico
oh yikes
all i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m spending money on rn is dorm stuff which is still really bad because we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t move in for another 2 months
i really wanna get a loft bed for my dorm but idk
I want to but a mini fridge, but don't know if it's worth it
because we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need two fridges and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kind of weird to split the cost of a fridge because who is going to take it when we part ways
i want a mini fridge
All y'all tho, overpacking is a very easy trap to fall into, and that means when moving out, its gonna b rough n expensive
but you dont need em
I did laundry each week so i had enough clothes for a week and 2 extra outfits incase something happened
I want to die every time I have to move
sorry howdy
Habanero ain't that hot
Not too bad
I feel like you doubt me
freshmen don't submit vaccy cards right
if they want a normal semester they do
but i didn't know we submitted our cards
what does a normal semester look like tho :pikathink:
I need to submit that stufd
15 months
but it feels that way
running btwn classes
having to physically go to office hours
what does it feel like to be forced to leave ur room everyday?
Going anywhere you want
You still haven't even been to campus yet
Nope
oml the temperature has gone down
not by much tho
my mom isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the most reliable with this stuff but she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already given her uncle details so hopefully it sticks ü§™
I can't believe Hannah has a fake ID
i actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have my state id yet
i can't believe Hannah doesn't have 2 fake ids
and there was a purple dog
the dog is named courage
that tummy tho :LAUGHING:
i never watched it because it freaked my mom out
felt like a fever dream tbh
like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tied to such a specific feeling for me
I cant believe this was actually on nickolodeon
~~hey guys i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting sick of being green give me a second~~
is anyone bringing a car to campus?
Same it scared me so much. But I forced myself to watch it
also so i can come back home whenever i want to
and go to target whenever i want to
fuck that i'm not driving 12 hours home
i have a job though
how am i supposed to carry them all back
idk
dont get multiple bags from target
what if i wanted to buy a large stuffed animal for comfort
idk you make it work
exactly why i need a car
I wasn't paying attention but I saw the notification and I needed to chime in
i just like being able to go wherever i want whenever i want
I'm vibing so hard
it's probably not everybody's jam but it certainly is mine
i want to bring a car
but i also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to drive 8 hours every time i have to go back home
but like i also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to not have a car at school
but like i also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to not have a car if i bring it to school and then decide to fly back home
unless you're commuting, you don't need a car
so really the solution here is just have 2 cars
you don't have to bring the car back every time you go home
ya but then i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a car at home
then just dont go home
i mean i could just always only drive back for long breaks
bro idk what to do
but i feel like i rely on my car so much for everything
i cant say I know you that well, i guess i haven't seen your information dumps
see for the first semester or so how it is without a car
you really haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ig
if you can't deal with it, then bring next semester
oh
deindividuation goes hard here
you'd be surprised by how much you won't need a car in college
but i think he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trust me to not cheat on him because i was a hoe before i dated him
so i feel sad about that
time will fix that
time travel and dont be a hoe before?
I'm sure as the relationship goes on he'll feel more comfortable
i mean i tried telling him that i was really only into him
i want to talk to him ab it but i also feel like maybe it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too early? i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to scare him off idk
and that you are actively working on being more committed
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m graduating in a few days and i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to ever think about a lot of people i know rn again
sometimes things do feel forced
again,, time really helps
i am really into him
imagine having ever been in one in the first place couldn't be me
relationships are hard
but then again i feel like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m reading too much into it early on
maybe dont joke about it so much? idk
like dont bring it up so much
but then today he like didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to happy ab a joke i made
It changes once you start dating someone
I think he might be feeling self conscious
ya i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want him to
u shouldnt overdo that either tho
is that bad?
idk
idk it can be cringey or clingy sometimes
oh
i feel like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mutual tho
yeah but u dont need to say it so often
yeah thats more normal tho
Take it slow.
i never got the whole pet names thing
oh
yeah thats fair
I didn't,, but after having a relationship where we did use pet names,, it still doesn't make sense but I get it?
idk i always thought it was cringe but we have this whole thing going on ab him trying to desensitize me to the things i think are √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcringe√¢‚Ç¨ in a relationship that are actually pretty normal
then again we were really weird as far as relationships go, people we were very close with did not know we were dating
and I'm sure for some relationships it isn't really necessary or comfortable
compliments honestly still do feel cringe to me ngl
i appreciate them as long as it doesn't appear forced
eh i never rly cared about them and its awkward to give them cause it usually feels either fake or unnecessary
that's fair
man i miss him
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on vacation rn
last time i saw him was yesterday
i only just told my best friend officially that we had dated, a year and a half after we broke up ü§™ü§™
which seems like a long time ago
i'm sitting in bed tired as shit after work lol
forgive the overshare: currently in an online relationship and the amount of human contact I need rn is about infinity
but it does feel like so much longer w him idk
yeah don't say ily yet LOL
possessive idk
What I mean is that. He might take it in a way. Cause like. Since he is still unsure. I'm not sure how to explain
mostly on how your SO feels about it
aww it's ok we're all growing and learning
did not have a thought in my head at that age i swear
not a single thought behind those eyes
first relationships are hard
ya idk
i feel so clueless
but i also just feel like i disappoint him sometimes
well idk
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just that i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really know what the hell im doing
idk the idea of teaching u a little weird ig
idk if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing too much
just do what u want
like how to hold hands in a car
idk
if your s/o wants to keep your relationship a secret from your friends, üö©
It really is
bc we both despise the couples at work and we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna be like them
idk
been there, and we feel bad for our s/o's
but i also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if i want that to happen
bc his best friend doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really like me
my ex wanted to hide it from all of our friends but i told people regardless
oh
we couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell our parents because uhh
my parents dont know about anyone that ive dated üíÄ
oh i eventually told them about my fling several months after we ended things and they were cool with it
i have only been in one relationship and i hid it from my parents for a year and a half and they still don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
but i just am kinda scared of his best friend finding out
i feel terrible for hiding things like that from my parents
and like when we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re at work i get the vibes he doenst like me
my mom sometimes asks why we stopped being friends and i have to lie
is he a rising freshman in college
I can't tell my parents because my mom is afraid of people online :cursed_flushed:
my sister once went on a date with this russian kid whose parents arranged a marriage for him after high school
cuz college relationships *can typically* become serious
I've had a surprising amount of people who wanted to date me online
couldn't be me atm
and this other time i liked this guy and i was pretty sure that he liked me but then i got scared and talked to him about tinder to scare him away
honestly 2 years isn't *too* bad imho
2 yrs isnt bad
idk
then a sophomore smh my head
it's summer so you're wrong
summer is for not school
school terms dont begin till fall
this isn't lala land tho
Its bad
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s never been a concern of mine
i wanna talk to him ab what i was worried ab?
idk
you don't wanna just dump it on him
That it's bad
we basically have the same work schedule but since i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on vacation i just have had hours without him
idk if he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 15 or 16. the relationship always skeeved me out
for another week
Romeo and Juliet laws are the shit
romeo and juliet laws. thing is they only apply in my state if he IS 16 and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 15 or 16
still legal
it's oversharing hours c:
oh
just talk ab me and the boo tang
we can talk about whatever we want
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the problem there
huh i dumb
can't minors date if they wanted to?
i feel like, this specific situation
i mean technically as long as you don't bone it's legal
For my case: I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 18 and well √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m alone üòî
law is fucking weird
Yeah as long as that doesn't happen they should be good
really tho the law only applies to sex. so technically if u never had sex with ur partner who was a minor then there would be no legal problem. but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stuff sketch
cant relate
man to think a week ago i was prepared to be forever alone
Being alone is great sometimes
After my last relationship
Man I missed it
cant relate
~~u might get a little bored after a while tho~~
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see that happening w the guy i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dating tbh. we have like so much chemistry it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s insane
Wish it was
i mean don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t humans naturally search for partners in life
~~or they can make life much, much worse~~
find the right person i guess
it feels like a cage
who hurt you
tho rewarding
i hate exhausting
but if u find someone u click w it can be very rewarding
alright fair
6 months
just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end up being codependent √Ç¬Ø\_(√£∆í‚Äû)_/√Ç¬Ø
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be together that long
oh shush
dont be negative
haha yes but we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been friends for so long idk what it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like to go a day without talking to him
yeah you arent, i retract my statement
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m having fun and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what i need until i go to college
so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s working for both of us rn
dont stress so much
ma he hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t answered me
i provide relationship advice but have never been in a relationship cuz coaches don't play and those who can't do, teach
I do gotta say tho
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been single for a very long time
he must be away from his phone
damn ...
I feel like other loce languages you can do online
so there were just. 2 unused concert tickets that i won and that my ex didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me keep or whteva
oh to be 16 and absolutely fucking stupid again
wo xi huan chi han bao bao except i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m vegetarian
oh sorry i didn't know
I DIDNT KNOW THESE NUTS FIT IN UR MOUTH AAHAHAHHAHA
oh
idk you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re the one with a boyfriend
girl idek if i know anymore
my love language is idk
you didnt see shit
Not anymore üòâ
Omg
I sure didnt
Sorry calie
ok bro this man is not texting me back wtf
poor cailee
isnt he driving
he should be home from work by now
time doesn't pause hunny raunak stole him
Getting a boyfriend is easy tho
no i depend on him for the majority of my happiness i want to talk to him
don't think about it much
maybe he is showering or maybe he was tired and went right to bed
it's gonna hurt real bad
uhh dont say that
no he never goes to bed without letting me know first
just don't obsess over it
Sorry you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gone
it's a really bad habit and it's gonna lead to really bad mental states
Getting obsessed leave you vulnerable
Yea don't be obsessed over anyone
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why he left you
idk how i bagged him
Obsession is a mental disorder tho
He really is ü•µü•µ
i wish a hot guy would like me üòî
i don't
From personal experience, I agree, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get obsessed
I almost read that as "don't be gay" and was like that's very homophobic
my standards for a guy (I'm a guy): don't be gay
"I only like people who dont like me"
dollnak doesn't breathe
ya adam is actually dead
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too early to do this
it really is
SORRY IM BUSY WITH ADAM RN
Yeah I got off from work and was like this is too intense for this late
Shit wrong joe
Yea he felt sorry for you
Why is everyone up this late go to bed
Alright I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll miss my vaccine if I go on with this BS. Bye y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all üëã
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that late anywhere
est only please omg
Maybe I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just very tired
Oh
oh
huh r they picking their nose
I miss when this was nice and wholesome
haha now suck each other off
y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all never heard of that?
nope
ah too bad
idk if id say too bad
i can't keep up it moves too fast
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just always on my phone
i would never mute this server i respect it too much üòê
I think I might need to mute this server
Yeah with a server this big u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t not have it muted I feel like
bad idea to have notifications on for discord in general
bad bad idea
not yet
its cuz bri'ish arent real
doesn't work for me
oh no
oh so in the ocean
Ugh
no not yet
cailee u are doing this wrong
idk man i have depresssion idk what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing half the time
listen,, I know it's hard when they don't respond
I feel like there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bigger issue here
but why tho
but you can't let it get to you
howdy is really being diligent with the reactions
@caileeee i have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to interactions and i too overthink everything but i've learned to ease myself and only react if they continue to act in a sus way
Cailee don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you think this is a rather personal issue and you maybe don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to discuss this in front of everybody?
why would i turn off notifs when i need constant validation from other ppl online üôÑ üòê
see take this with a grain of salt because sometimes i mean to reply and then suddenly it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been a month and i still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t replied
Oi u never followed me back on Instagram
i just feel like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so
Just call your friends. Texting sucks
*ppl b so scared of calling these days, tis wack*
I just don't like using my voice
i'm not cuz i hardly have anyone to call
How about cause calling sucks?
Calling doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t suck
i only call my grandfather because he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to text
plus im not close with many people to even call them
u have to be close with someone it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so personal
why didnt h use zoom or something
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
i did not want to argue
i can't believe none of you followed you on my Instagram
my bad zachary
i just dropped my phone
did you drop it like its hot tho?
stanford√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rejection letter was so bad i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even care that i got rejected because i expected it
yeah ik i just wanted to make a bad joke
i haven't even used my insta in several weeks
my life is so boring
boderline sad
I feel like you answer with be really stupid given that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s discord and everyone is joking around
Omg this guy just said tits omg
someone is getting angwee
that's some sick animation ngl
why is that white gamer tho
stupid keywords smh
a lot of gamers get pissed off by that assumption but it's funny
HOLY SHIT LMAOOO
I don't have rgb and am not gay but now I wanna do either of them but not the other just for the hell of it
Kinda want a rgb
kinda want rbg :(
I do want rgb but I'm a laptop user so I don't really have much to rgb
oh SHIT
There is no African country starting with K
i miss her
yeah i don't like acb
oh I did
but I need a laptop with stylus support
well nothing gamer√¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏ will have that
I'm 100% more organized digitally so I'm gonna take all my notes on laptop
sigh
acb's voice is so annoying
the bar isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even on the floor
xps is ok, you dont get any ports tho which suck.
acb is a prime example of girl power and the h8ters will never accept it üò©
facys i learned this in ap hug freshman year
I am bad at island geography
i watched up until pablo died
i never understood the concept of 2 generals
but it doesn't work for me
@sprinkles2108 well when one general is useless as fuck, kind of like Robert e Lee. You kind of need another one
we never move this fast
you are disrespecting my culture so hard rn
some channels are ded/useless tho
I can't focus on chat anymore
wtf are u supposed to bring when u go somewhere
my friend's server has a ton but there's like 10k members so they're all used
i suppressed pings in that server because she has an @ everyone going for this random twitch streamer and frankly i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be pinged every time he does something
terrible
now im crying
idk
Cuz Florida
Huh
I thought I left discord on dnd
Basically was cleaning so put on notifs cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m too addicted to discord
jenin with capital letters is really freaking me out rn
I mean, I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use my laptop rn
instead of turning on dnd i manually mute every server im on bc im stupid ü§°
Dw I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m freaking out even more
Discord phone sucks*
if im at work im on my phone
but otherwise im on my laptop
not always when i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just. online though i might be on my computer doing other stuff
sam i thought you went to bed
nah I just said I didn't wanna focus on chat for a bit
also i started calling my gf so i didn;t really wanna multitask too much
fair
I'm going to have a bad night >:(
sad...
Nuuu don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have bad night
anybody still up? :blurryeyes:
Your hand ever get the buzzing feeling
After you use your phone too long
it's just because my blood flow is so weak it gets blocked by anything
i didn't sleep
Why are YOU awake
oh where are you from
with you, i have nothing else to offer to the conversation üò≠
Oh well, idk if you know it. But i was watching dum laga me haisa
i haven't watched that one yet
I miss when Indian movies were good
Now they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just.. really not I guess
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t heard of it at all
U don't have to watch 1 to understand the other ones right
Nope
i haven't watched that
Idk if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like it but I did
yea i won;t like it
the movie is stupid
update on the alarm clock: it did work but i have underestimated my willingness to go tf back to sleep
i am very much trying to avoid just turning off the device because if i do it enough times then i will learn how to do it in my sleep
i turn off my phone alarms in my sleep if i keep it close to my bed
i have to turn off the alarm using my phone and i actually have to open the app and not just press the lock screen
the problem with being woken up by a sound for me is that it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consistently work and i need multiple alarms to do it. which is not ideal with a roommate
i would sleep thru that
unless you aren't really photosensitive
i sleep with a blanket over my head
been doing it like ten years and i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t died yet
fair
i started doing it because i was scared of the dark as a kid
aw h
you could alternatively try to get yourself into a rhythm of trying,, hold on,, is that how rhythm is spelled?
i have to turn off the alarm on my phone
what the fuck
Wtf is lofting a bed
ok fair
idk what I'll put under tho
I'm hoping it's enough room for some sorta couch or something
because i don't really use desks so that wouldn't help much
My mom wants me to bring a mini fridge  into my dorm room...
i want to bring a mini fridge into my dorm room
oh agreed
you will want a minifridge
When my dad was younger he did this too but he slept weird one night and his left leg fell asleep so when he tried to stand he just fell over lol
my dad has this alarm, and he's sometimes hard of hearing
It won't stop, you have to turn it off yourself
But he won't, cuz he can't hear itüò≠üò≠üò≠
at least if he left the room
ah panic waking, nothing like adrenaline once you wake up
it's the worst thing ever
Oh yeah, that was me when i missed online class
And i woke up knowing full on i missed it
rip
was it mandatory tho
Not that mandatory it seems
I once napped in the middle of class and missed like the last 2 classes of the day. Completely unintentional
In person classes r a waste of time tho
i'll miss watching lectures at 2x speed
i'll miss having the option to not show my face to others
@speedbirdconcorde2 how do SI sessions work in person
i'll miss not actually having to wear non-pj clothes to school
holy shit i just realized @speedbirdconcorde2 is not a 2024
wtf
to class
There's TA Office hour, which will exactly be what it sounds like
U don't have to walk there
I learned the piano through zoom, there's nothing u can't do through it
watch me get completely lost
wtf is this emote
hi people i was riding my bike then i realized i probably should not be outside without sunscreen
ope, I never wear sunscreen :cursed_flushed:
bad
i ran out of sunscreen :(((((((((((
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t burn
couldn't be you
i ran out too
i can't
i want to learn how to
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want skin cancer
Cuz sun
i don't
also i don't want skin cancer
you need to protect your skin :( i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t burn much but you should always protect yourself regardless
I want screen from sun
apparently sunscreen that has benzene is really bad for you tho
Well idk if mine has benzene, i should be fine
your screen won't get burned from a bike ride lmao
That's why I need sun screen
I can't do no hands
I need insecurity screen
yes but the UV rays still get to your skin even if it's not visible
I didn't wear anything while biking
Now that's where you go wrong
i don't think i have acne but i tend to break out
Never heard of her
There are some bad things that have happened to the climate, but I am really glad I was born in the 21st century
my dad bought this detergent that was a floral scent and i broke out so badly because of it
Oh no
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have lavender on my skin lol
Before the 21st century, it was very common to die of war, famine, etc. and there were very few human rights in most of the world
the only thing good about this century is technological and medical advances but other than that, we don't socialize in-person anymore (even without covid) and the environment is deteriorating at an alarming rate
there are good and bad things about this century
> we don't socialize in-person anymore
huh? we do
hahahaha bro you don't live in the US
I mean, it's not all that different still
you wouldn't know. it's really lonely here
you can't talk about the entirety of america anyway
America lonely fr fr
if i have children it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not going to happen until my career is established
which is why it feels more lonely here
yea but that does not mean people are lonely
If I have children it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll prob be right after residency or something, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to make the mistake of being too old like my parents when they had me :(
Nopity nope
Omg same, mine was 39
If someone was half Indian half Native American could call them Indian Indian
Cuz no
raunak maybe you just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have friends
wasnt the last time you visited india 10 years back?
My memory of things that happened when I was a child is bad
my alarm clock vibrates when my phone rings :cursed_flushed: it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s annoying
that's their choice but we shouldn't call them indians cuz they're indigenous
are you seriously saying that social life has changed so much in the last decade?
I like used to agree with u but if they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consider it offensive there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no reason it should be
I would never actually say Indian but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just saying you could
To be fair, it's possible for there to be a massive change in norms and culture within several months, like what we saw with COVID-19
i'm not even talking purely about the time difference. im just saying that you cant generalise an entire country just cause you met some extroverts on your trip a decade back
Ain't that a compliment
Maybe he hates his country
i never disputed that. im simply questioning the source of that
only i can say brownüò≠, didn't wanna give off wrong idea
im hungry
hi hungry
No no, i mean since I'm brown
ok yea i was worried you were white
sorry idk many muslim names
I was born here tho
oh cause you left me hanging here so...
Oh i didn't see that
idk man
Oh
i passed the genetics test
raunak isn't even ethnically bengali lmao
idk
My bad my bad
oh boi
Bro i hate India soaps
are you supposed to pronounce it like "non" bread
We just went into breakout rooms in my Econ class and one kid turned on his camera and was vaping :cursed_flushed:
what reddit post isn't about you?
soon i will be able to see
work
work succ
i feel like florida man is more of a super *morally unambiguous person* instead of a super *hero*
Lol don't you mean "morally ambiguous"
the rain must be gone
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m looking to take chem 105, biol 214 + 214L, math 125, and neur 166
math 121, chem 105, phys 121, sages
oh and sages
not too bad then
That was my exact schedule first semester except I took 126. I think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll find that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s doable
yeah idk if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have the calc credit but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to skip it regardless
At least more work
So you would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken it second semester if things were normal right?
calc was one of the 3 exams i *could* get a 5 on
No I would've taken it fall still because I didn't know what I was getting myself into and also because I skipped 105
I still would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken it in the fall
hoping to get the psych credit
And some psych classes here aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hard
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about in-person though
If you have credit for Calc AB, you can skip MATH 125 and go to 126
Regardless you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be behind
will I have to take math twice either way? or can I take 126 and be done with math
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take MATH 121/122
Doesn't count
AP stats doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cover for 312
Lol me and Pri sound like a broken record
I have to take math 121/122 for math degree credits :KEKW:
ive already taken calc ab and bc so not worried about 121/122
I guess I could take the ap test for calc bc but idk if I want to lmao
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t some med schools not accept ap credit?
which is why i dont think i want to take the ap test
As a math major you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re bound to take upper level math classes and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll work for med school. So if you skip 121/122 then do it (if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re comfortable)
That is correct, but for math most schools are more lenient
but im worried since both years it was Covid Calculus and idk how much I actually know lmao
Ah fair
Well, you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be behind if you retake 121/122
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I took math 126 to be safe because even though I got credit for BC I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t comfortable with the content
They didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t offer it this past winter
If you want to retake, retake for understanding, not for med school
Gonna be honest, calc isn't that important for premed
then i think ill just take 121 and 122, i dont even have the basic differentiation rules memorized
Literally as a pre med you just need Calc 1 and 2, and stats
last two years every single test/exam was open notes so...
im not bad at it i just dont know how much I will actually know and dont want to enter calc 122 or higher and be like uhhh idk what to do
Yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
because for some reason my calc class didn't teach them this year
I don't think that's covered in calc
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s covered in math 126 but I struggled a little since my alg 2 teacher in hs didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t teach it
I've literally never learned about matrices
AP Calculus doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cover matrices
But math 126 does
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about 125
Interesting, I don't think MATH122 does tho
But MATH122 counts for MATH126
I think I'm gonna do math 122
So you'd think MATH122 would be more comprehensive
Yeah, but engineers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need matrices I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think lol
frankly i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i want to skip anything i need for med school
We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just covered in 126 is all I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m saying
is it like bad to do a BA over a BS, if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m premed and math
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
For my '25 people have any of yall tried generating schedules yet?
math majors are the best :KEKW::cursed_flushed:
Bruh what does "/s" mean? I've been seeing that a lot lately
Not physically, just mentally I guess
Bruh how does everyone know this except me
I really do be a boomer
I think Twitter? I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
rip
That looks like a rough combo of 18 though
I remember someone in the '24 GroupMe asked about doing freshman forgiveness like 2 weeks after the semester ended :cursed_flushed:
Rip
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just lazy since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on my phone
GO TO SLEEP
Again, everyone gets it except me lol
Sad pharma career anyone?
Every career sounds sad to me
I hate life
even if you don't know your major yet
i can't actually speak on travel time tho. i would ask a '23 or a '22
at least as of right now I have only one class on friday and no 8 ams, sages could change that though
we picked the same classes except i have 125 üëÅüëÅ

then you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the assignment yet (?) i think
oh
idk where to find any of this information
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listen too much to them when it comes to academics
Idk I remember doing it last year
Nope
Well then navigators work differently then
Yeah, but you need an actual reason to be able to do that
omg me too
she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhy do you want to major in neuroscience√¢‚Ç¨ idk i like brains
yeah I basically didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell her much since she read the letter lol
You know every time someone has me tell them about myself I realize how lame I really am
I feel this :KEKW: :cursed_flushed:
I think mine asked me that too idk
You never know
Even more awkward if you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make any
@raunakwastaken I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any Finals on my birthday this year :KEKW:
Are you trying to flex on me?
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the math gods√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ present to you
I do have finals the two days before my bday tho
Bye
Bye
bye
Bye?
Bye!
Fuck off
Fuck on
just showered so am feeling *clean*
Finishing up my last day in NM
tho it's not like there's any difference on the east coast where i am
Went on tons of hikes
you don't know :0?
Oh no!
Being allergic to dairy sucks
yeah it doesn't help much
very sad
i had a dog named samson
me: I don't like formal
also me: "sir sam"
we never did call him sam or samson
dog
my sister, when she was a child and could barely speak because idk she had speech problems, tried to say "doggy" when pointing at him and said "deedee"
aw
close
my grandfather and my immediate family are missing his 7 month late bar mitzvah party because i happen to be graduating on the same day
I don't have half siblings
idk how to make that distinction
I don't know how he did that
And this is an Arkansas hate account
it is objectively the worst state
Yeah I can't think of a worse state
i do not want to talk about it
Arkansas sucks
I have a few biological siblings I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never met before :KEKW:
I think they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like 10-15+ years older than me but idk
dew it. kill heem
Until I was about 9 I wanted to major in physics so i could invent a lightsaber
until i was about 9 i wanted to be an astronaut
until I was 13 I didn't think I was gonna get a job
I was just like: eh I'll die at 19
tbh i still dont think im gonna get a job, even tho i have a job rn
I wanted to be a fireman
I don't have a job
I need a job
But i don't want one
I don't dream of work
you can work my job if u give me the money
fuck no
but we dont talk about that
u dont know what my face looks like
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talk about fim√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you say you were going to start a company
we were afraid to do it under the table cause of the laws
yeah thats why we didnt do it
u can give people botulism if u do it wrong
and obviously wed make sure not to do it wrong
but it means they probably take it very seriously
so we didnt want to risk it
tbf, i dont actually like kombucha
my requirements for a business are: 1) it must be profitable 2) it most be legal enough that i wont get in trouble 3) it must be ethical
most philosophers probably arent the biggest fans of capitalism
but they oppose it for all the wrong reasons imo
> no one has yet to notice
Nah you need a license to run a lemonade stand here
@aidenkim1 fuck you
Didn't buzzfeed started off as an accelerationist media
idk
I think they still r
I think it's cuz the founder did his masters thesis on accelerationism
Wtf based
Even though that's an Osmerid
wtf are u on about
neoconservatism aint it chief
Yes, but personally I still think Biden is accelerating enough, if not more
what the fuck
Zach has gone off the deepend today
Wtf is a brook trout, why was I pinged
@eekhannah you didnt happen to live in washington as a young child and then get held back a grade/take a gap year did you
Who else wants a fish descriptor
Don't we already have a republican club
Unfortunately
rip
R u the one in missed connections
Who doxxed someone
Isn't this the typical beginning of a story that goes like "turns out she's now doing porn" or have I been on the wrong corner of the internet
i didnt rly have views cause like
Oh you have CONTEMPT for her
i needa find her
dont make me come in there an confiscate it
somehow i lost the musical part tho
Me but she broke up with me because I convinced another boy to eat grass and his mom was friends with her mom
you hate him cause you aint him
Were you potentially in the wrong bathroom
oh rip
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have one
i remember i went to camp and i acquired a best friend for a few days and i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen her since
i forgot my grandmas name for like 2 months
and couldnt ask my parents
long lost siblings?
Mine aren't lost enough nor for long enough for my liking
An inactive Korean middle aged man took @ moseslee on Instagram and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stuck with the vastly inferior @m0seslee
you could kill him
lol my preferred insta handle was taken cause i made an account without realizing it and somehow lost access to it
why didnt u keep it
do i need to block u again
Just don't buy norwegian salmon
I've got so many water hours
damn i was an ugly newborn
Thats not that bad
i was a cute child idk what happened
I was an ugly newborn and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ugly still to this day
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have my face as my pfp because there are people i interact with on discord whom i would rather not know what i look like
actually my grandfather is visiting on thursday and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to disappoint him immeasurably
I don't think Hannah wants to tangle with a 6 foot long toothy biting machine
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know me
i hate crickets
i wish crickets did not exist. every cricket i see will be killed
Because you seem *fishy*
or just get the bread without eating it

I was trying to fix my audio since I have a mixer I use for gaming, zoom calls, etc. and it fucking broke

BRUH i cant believe that the collegeboard didnt bother to make a fraction input system
For the BC Calc exam
They said fuck you write it all out in plain text
Took like 10 minutes to do those long ass fractions
to be fair this is very in character with the college board
So unfair I could do those problems easily within the time period if I was taking this at school on paper
ha imagine thinking the bc calc exam was hard LMAO
couldn't be me
It was hard
TBF i didn't study whatsoever
and wrote "please fucking kill me" in 3 of them\
isn't a* the top grade on the GCSEs
for the UK
I dunno
@denorisjust don't think of how hot I am during the test
aren't the exams curved?
bubblegum tho
luckily there's a different curve for the online exam
I didn't recognize most of the questions
I feel like my teacher taught physics 1 by accident
rip to wes || music/physics '25
guessed C on the last 15 questions
it hurts
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting mine out this summer
Nobody is taking my wisdom away
dont mess up
it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a job interview

y'all the 3 pound box of candy is almost gone :cursed_flushed:

You know what isn't cozy? Gum disease
today we in pain, so nah
i worked 11 hours yesterday i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so fucking tired
I sometimes sleep right after washing my hair is that badüò≥
didn't y'all (Americans) have a political candidate that ran entirely on a platform of dental health?
with floss police and shit
I laughed at the guy, but then also wanted to kick him in the non-existent balls
trump was both dumb and in power which made him scary
He's so annoying, I wanna tear his fuckig wig off
Lmfaoooo, bruhüò≠ I'm too violent sounding for just waking up
Dumbass spends $70k on his hair for it to still look like shit
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t old enough to vote :CB_sadge:
I wish i couldve voted last year
if i were a month younger i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have been able to vote
biden wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t my first choice
imagine being able to vote. couldn;t be me
imagine. couldn't be me
Every other fucking candidate was smarter than that cheeto
i liked pete for awhile but then i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like pete
My left shoe is smarter than trump
except maybe booker
I wanted him bc he was young kinda done with boomers :cursed_flushed:
but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think pete would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve won against trump
In the midst of the ignominy he plunged this country into, I feel at peace with Donald Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dwindling legacy. The country turning its back on him in shame is a fitting punishment for a monster of his caliber.
Bro people still think he should be president
please don't remind me
we all know what typa people tho
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been several months
kamala was honestly one of my top choices even though i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really align with her. i thought she was competent and experienced enough while also not being old yknow
idk about that, i saw something that like a quarter of americans think he'll be reinstated within the year
I'm so sorry
didn;t she say "do not come" to a group of people?
I think that was taken outta contwxt
Oh loll
going into this election cycle i was more worried about having someone with a brain than someone i completely aligned with
I am indeed worried that Trump would pull a Cleveland
I was dying at work
Oh
what happened to their brain cells
Cuz murrica
think trump must have been repeatedly hit in the head or smth
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t he get mashed potatoes dumped on his head as a kid or did i imagine that
He was bullied in school that much I know
I remember reading that he was one of those people who tried so so hard to fit in with the elite
well.. for good reason i guess. Look how he turned out.
And those around him spotted the fake he was from a mile away
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get there before it gets deleted
i have to try to switch my minecraft account√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s email so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lose it ü•¥
trump sucks, as a person, as a president, as everything, but the real problem is the many uneducated and impoverished white people who voted for him
Yes because they thought he'd solve their problems
Terrible powerful leaders always targeted the weak public, with promises of a better life
I sympathise for his voter base, economically speaking at the very least. But I will refuse to concede an inch of ideological ground to fascists who want people like me dead
tbh i dont think of trump as "dictator-in-the-making", but more as "buffoon who somehow got power"
idk though, i think we need to pour money into education
We need more of the budget to go into education PLS
but then ppl will cry the education system is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBiAsEd√¢‚Ç¨
https://discord.com/channels/791233062998245376/791233062998245379/852573247446843492 after we said this someone said Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s head was hit more than a few times (https://discord.com/channels/791233062998245376/791233062998245379/852573372948938762) so I said he was used as a baseball bat and then made the Indian connection
imo the man thing is to nationlize funding instead of having it be based on areas, so rich people dont have nice schools while poor people have shitty schools
It's so fucking absurd
maybe it's just optimism, but i really believe trump voters aren't evil, and with education could understand and switch sides
I feel bad for decent Texans
like bitch wtf you saying
okay i see but you worded it very wrong just saying...
Pro choice isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even pro abortion like :cursed_flushed:
Fucking hypocrites
i;m just pointing this out to you. don't need to be narcissistic about it
its probably worth taking a second to realize that we're going to college and (mostly) better off then most of the trump voters we're talking about. it's difficult to understand their perspective, but i dont want to be too elitist
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t all I said was idc lol
We as a school are centrist
i guess i mean the poorer people
College Republicans?
i even know a republican and he puts republican shit on his stories which is cringe
So it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really all a mix
Regardless, I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong for her to compare that with communism
what do you mean? trying to understand. from my perspective, we're relatively rich, and might struggle to understand the large impoverished, uneducated bloc who voted for trump. there's plenty of rich people who voted for trump, but i think that a lot of them voted for their economic gain. also i'm not saying all poor people voted for trump
What I take issue with is that, she may be an American citizen now, but China is still her home and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t appreciate her stepping on her own home country just to prove a point
I'm literally low income, i would never think about voting for Cheeto man. I've been oppressed enough to understand thatüò≠üò≠
Saying that poor people voted for trump and only the more rich didn't is kinda classist
Just because you're poor doesn't mean you're uneducated
hmm i dont think thats the issue here. the cultural revolution was pretty clearly a bad thing
that also seems a bit nationalistic
ok, all that is fair. i saw some people being kind of elitist and not understanding why people voted for trump and i wanted to point that out
i dont think she has any reason to feel connected to china now if she doesnt want to
We don't have to like why they did
yes, but i guess i sympathize. i don't like what they did, but i don't think they're evil. I agree with all your points, though
I don't like sympathizing with people who want me dead, so I'm good
Seeing the y'know.. hate crimes
Islamophobia, asian hate crimes,my bodily autonomy
Oh oh, and you can't forget homophobia
Wtf is going on in this chat
yeah fair
my class dean was the librarian
Oh I'm dumb
Close enough
üò≠ i can't tell over discord sometimes
dont come at me with that marxist literary criticism
I miss reading
i don't read
unless i have to for class
Why don't you read anymore?
i havent read dracula
I haven't read :cursed_flushed:
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really love the plot of frankenstein but i loved the metaphorical implications
oh. i forgot
Never finished, will do todayüòÅ
Sometimes I really can't blame Jordan peterson for criticizing "postmodernists" while having never read anything abt them, cuz the academia is full of bs made of misunderstanding of postmodern stuff to start with
While he's really criticizing many branches of the academia who r misusing philosophy
he blew up on the internet for criticizing a piece of Canadian legislation that would mandate the use of correct pronouns
he said it has nothing to do with trans people, but "government overreach"
the legislation would make misgendering people an actual crime tho
actually i shouldn't even be comparing the two
he ignores the actual problems
Idk if it's intentional
omg the lobster analogy
i forgot what its called lol
oh yeah he falls into the trap of playing the "cancel culture" card far too much
buzz lightyear knew what the fuck was up dude that guy could fucking get it
god I wish that were me üòî
Wtf lol
RPI really wants you to believe they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate eomen
they do hate eomen
I'm talking abt the worse one
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so nothing!!! that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing rpi
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing. it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bag full of air rpi
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like u spent three hours in a board meeting coming up with the best and healthiest snack and what you came up with is an empty plate full of nothing
women they want u to think they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate. eomen don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even bother applying
I still need more context lol, genuinely curious
What happened, is there a news story I missed?
no wait sorry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m confusing rpi with rice. rpi doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually secretly hate women
poor rpi
I just find their motto cringe
yeah I just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep all the god damn names straight name your school something memorable like Case East Reservoir College
when i first applied my parents thought i was applying for military school
fuck u western reserve
western reserve can suck my fatty
I wish the worst of u
every year they put up a tent but for some reason they decided covid meant that a tarp overhead was a bad idea
I think there was supposed to be a time limit but everyone went over and we graduated like an hour later than we were supposed to
coincidentally 15 minutes is exactly the amount of time you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be late by if you want to receive the message that the party was kicked back by an hour
we can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to clubs moses we live in america not whatever bougie country you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re from fucking king kong or some shit
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any friends so no one invites me to parties
oh no
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to take off my glasses so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see anyone
oh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not fair for them to do that
the principal speaks after me i think and then we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t line up until after everyone is done speaking
my parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to fight someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s grandma for a seat at the front üòé
so far i've only compiled a total of 7 people including myself
how tf did you find me on LinkedIn
i haven't posted to Instagram in a very long time
I've been lazy since the pandemic hence no upload for the past year or two :cursed_flushed:
moses finds all in due time
too self conscious can't post stuff
YOUR WISH SHALL BE GRANTED
i haven't had a bagel in a while
That needs to change
but you won't even share
what am i supposed to do
actually sam idk where you live
but my grandfather doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live there anymore :(
my dad is from new jersey though
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live in a beach town
scarborough is good too if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to cross the bridge
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even like the beach too much but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to miss the ocean at case :(
I'm gonna miss the ocean at case and i don't even live close to it
idk
no need to body shame :/
Sorry sorry that was rude
too late
Yeah that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really add up
Wish me luck on my AP stats test
it's not that bad
Mine was but my dad said I looked like a Jesus cosplayer so I got it cut
i didnt download anyting but the site it takes you to is not a youtube redirect
i thought so too but i got it soo do what u want !! üíû
I wasn't either

OPE JENIN YOU LOST YOUR NITRO
rip jenin
Last day of school today, 2 periods left. üò≠
AP Calc Bc is my final class today, def sad about that one üòû
imagine still having cable in 2021 :cursed_flushed:
Sorry but I don't speak broke
Tho at least for me Disney + is sufficient
I've watched all there is to watch on Netflix and ended that
I'm not broke, just frugal. I have so much more than I can ever watch with Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I'm not planning to get Disney+ or HBO Max soon.
Prime kinda sucks, I pay so much just for free shipping on occasional shoppings and I can't even watch all the good stuff?
Tarantino didn't make a lot of movies though so you can watch his entire filmography quite quickly
Sorry 6.49
Shit
Too much work, I rather pay 6.49 a month
Tho I do have one alias but
I don't wanna register a whole other account
i mean...your wish
I understand the principle of getting Prime for free for 4 years though. A lot of the richest people in the world are extremely frugal and hate spending
Prime doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have as many options as netflix so
At least I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it does
128 gb won't last that long if you're taking a lot of photos. If each photo is 20 MB, then 128 GB is only enough for 6,400 photos
I used to take a lot since I was a fairly serious photographer but I haven't used my DSLR lately ü§°
The flash drive is mainly for our docs or whatever I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
I want to get back into photography
I don't know. It's big and heavy and difficult to carry around so even if I do take it, I won't use it often
tbf iphone cameras are p good nowadays
Yeah I mostly use my iPhone camera
my phone sometimes acts like a toast
I used to upload my photos to vsco and then basically stopped lol
My phone can sometimes be glitchy too
I want to get a new phone on Black Friday but I don't want to spend more than $550
I may get a new iPhone this year or next year
Dunno yet
yikes too late
If you really need a phone, you probably shouldn't wait until Black Friday
Apple√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s deal isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even that significant
well i don;t "really" need it but consumerism goes brrr
I get my phones unlocked so I can use any carrier I want
Oh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t haha
Btw @everyone AT&T is the worst major phone carrier don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it
ope my dad told me to get at&t
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know I hated AT&T so much
Never had service at school
So it depends on your location I guess
Apparently att has more coverage but in my case that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cap
First summer where I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to do any studying in a while
Feels pretty boring
fair
but to be fair: would studying fix that?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the paper today i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m feeling like a celebrity
I don't
Damn you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re big brain
Like I just get so bored out of my mind I'm actually hoping for school to start
go to store
do you still have to do your speech?
Work
I would work if I could but that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll not happen until I physically get to campus ü§ß
Well the thing is I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m here on student Visa so I legally can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t unless its on campus
Oh rip
Normally I go home every summer but w Covid and stuff I really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel like quarantining and all that
Fair
Should've specified, sorry
ping beats pong, pong beats ping, and if you play bong you instantly lose
i know damn well its not overdue
I think it's a glitch bc my application portal says the schedule is due 6/25
the family behind my family was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwow! she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a great speaker√¢‚Ç¨ crying
the only problem is the livestream is such a bad angle it did me so wrong
don't have to be right wing to own a gun u know
ik but I still put them in the that category unless I see a reason not to
Fair
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired as hell man
There's a point in the next few days when you actually realize you won't be going back to high school. You may understand it now, but the reality of losing the last 13 years of your life will set in soon. @eekhannah
Idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s losing but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 13 years well spent
as i was speaking i realized how much i was going to miss my friends :( graduation kind of stood between me and confronting the fact that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going far away but now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like. damn.
@eekhannah i completely get ittt, it still hasn't hit me that i'm moving so far away
You get over this feeling surprisingly fast
u realize who actually wants to be ur friend once u leave for college
I'll wake up early today, because I want to see Bryce hall get his cheeks clapped at 7pm
worse, they could be unmarried
do most people on pre med track take math 121 or 125
we're engineers so we need to take the 121/122 track
125/126 is okay for the BA but the BS needs 121, 122, linear algebra, and probability or statistics
you can also take placements tests for 121/122 if you feel confident about the material
i took the bc exam but i self studied the class in like 1 month and i need a 5 for 122 credit and theres no chance üò≠ üî´
never say never!!
bruh french 310 conflicts with every math class that i can take
i dunno if im gonna add chinese to my schedule üò¨
Dw Chinese isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that hard
i can speak chinese really badly its the reading thats hard for me
my time spent in the US did not help either
idk if ukraine could say the same
but i forgot the last time i was there
i have it but i dont use it ü•≤
pinyin is for when i dont know how to write the word
really?
and any words i dont know i usually just dont use them
this is a travesty, what happened to free speech...
the US Constitution applies to all US citizens except for Alex
what are you a fucking gift card
i'm the most anti-ccp member of my family but i have nothing against the actual country
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking back the stereotype!!
Lick the dog
Idk man, sauteed mushrooms:chefkiss: :chefkiss:

Last year you weren't allowed in any building or room that wasn't assigned to you
Oh
And the data showed that even people being stupid outside showed wayyyyyyy less infection than people hanging out in rooms
IF Y'ALL UPLOAD YA GEE DAMN VACCY CARDS
i already did don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t yell at me
We need to hit like 70 or 80
But even though I was super strict and I caught hell for that, *I didn't have a single confirmed infection in my building all year*
dang i wish
My parents did and even tho i didn't text positive, i did have antibodies
And i did get sick while they got sick. But.. yeah
A bunch of my friends did back home but I never got it
Some of them were incredibly sick
Oh? I didn't see em
the fuck
I was cleaning off my numpad because it was dusty
*zachary.exe* has stopped working
i wanna cracc my back so bad
it was 86% last week though
30% of rain
they don't mean there's a 30% possibility it'll rain
Will get rain
Isn't that just "30% chance you'll be in the area that will get rain, so it's a 30% chance of rain"
I don't even knowüò≠
The internet is not helping rn
Here's how the National Weather Service describes it
> What does this "40 percent" mean? ...will it rain 40 percent of of the time? ...will it rain over 40 percent of the area?

> The "Probability of Precipitation" (PoP) simply describes the probability that the forecast grid/point in question will receive at least 0.01" of rain. So, in this example, there is a 40 percent probability for at least 0.01" of rain at the specific forecast point of interest!

That's how u find a job
sigh

It had me dying
Oh they don't. They definitely don't
Hell idk ask the chemistry majors

Society says we have to wake up at 8
Fuck society
I don't like how structured this is
David's crazy is entertaining himself for 2 hours AND 5 minutes
More than 2 hours a day and I begin to feel guilty
I'm actually managing to wake up at 7 AM most days now and I'll have to do that in the fall too since I have an 8:25 class
To be honest, I just feel exhausted most nights and collapse because I don't feel like I can do anything more
I need 7.5-8 hours sleep on average to feel rested üòê
man that sucks,,
it's healthy to have a bit of time without any purpose
I watched like... 3 hours of movies alone
You don't even have to have more screentime
Go outside
Sounds good doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work
How much time? 6+ hours a day?
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re lost cases
Tbh I don't know what I'm doing either
We all lost
I feel lamia is just saying all this but is super smart irl
Death and taxes
i spend far too much time on my phone
Today an old man told me to stay away from boys in college
He was like what school are you in and I said college and he was like stay away from them boys
Collegeüò≠
This is like when you think the answer is b, but you choose c. And then the answers turned out to be b after all
Sigh
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let the bed bugs bite
not charging my phone to 100% is extremely liberating
trying to keep my battery healthy
I charge it to 100% if I know I need to leave the house for the day
Holy crap my battery capacity has gone down to 85%
It was 94 several months ago
Sigh
And I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had this phone for 3 years
Oh
My phone still charges to 100 percent and I got it 3.5 years ago
Well maximum capacity on iPhone means when you charge to 100% it actually charges to 85% in my case
I dont
my phone is brand new but my old phone said 78% there
My 2 year old phone ü•¥
I only feel a little bad for it
I running out of storage on my phone
No i don't want this phone anymore
i need to delete my speech from my phone
need to keep it on phone
If sages instructor asks you to introduce yourself to the class just open insta and play the speech :KEKW:
My phone battery used to be bad but I got it replaced
you tried
I'm so tired
hi so tired, im dad
my really original joke
I thought it wasn't required
i want my half a year off
fuck you expensive school
It's not, but if they don't reach their 80% threshold they're worried about the virus spreading and we might still have to wear masks and social distance and such
Where can I upload my vaccine card
Fuck micro chips ppl
Wtf
Someone didn't understand why vaccines were important
They were like "they shouldn't force us!"
this chat is dead af
it'll die down even more when school starts
2024 stayed relatively alive this past year cuz of covid

Omg giveaway
robin what the fuck
I already have a copy, can I receive equavalent cash instead
Yea I haven't been in 3 yrs tho
Whats wrong üíÄüíÄ
tired
I hate being hated, I hate being nothing but a cop, I hate not helping because people only think of me as the covid cops
Doesn't matter. If we don't get to 80% we're all wearing masks still.
We need 3260 more people to upload their cards
ateveryone if u don't wear ur mask
And it's gonna suck shit
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really mind masks

@everyone if you are an antivaxxer my dms are open and I am feeling violent

My roommate freshman year said that he wanted a single but chose a double because he wanted friends and he should of gotten a single because he was a douche

U don't need 1. A double to get friends 2. Friends
i'm never alone
discord is here
There aren't very many singles
i dubbed every person that hmu i feel like trash lmaoo
I don't think my freshman roommate is my friend yet

But why do you want to be a tooth person
NEVER. ILL GO BRITISH B4 BRUSHING

Do you want to be a dentist?
~~someone pls yeet me to sleep i need it~~
I am cursed with moderately shaded teeth, even though my oral health is excellent
Idk what I want to study in med school lol
I've been really really really thinking about getting dental bleaching done
White strips tho
My teeth still need correction
I haven't actually tried
they be uncomfy tho
I need my wisdom teeth out
I got mine out last Wednesday
My bottom two are so impacted that they're going to need a chainsaw to get those mfs out
me too but i'm deathly scared of the things i'd say to my parents in the car afterward
oh noo
And I still have underbite
I still haven't made the tiktok I promised to make
I'm a bad friend
They probably forgot
Don't
i have two tiktok accounts and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the app
I have a hard time sleeping for the past 3 days or so
oh
I am scared of many things
Holy fuck
I didn't even see the actual film
I realized
Isn't really on a circular axis
Rip
RIPP guess im not getting a room tomorrow
Weren't ID pics supposed to be in in like April
I took it late at night and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about how I looked at the time so my picture is garbage :COPIUM: :njnjkj:

Just call potus and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll fix it for you :MALARKEY:
crack on the train bro u never tried?
Joe Biden never responded to my DMs ü•∫
for the longest time ever I've wanted to ask
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t slept in 28 hours wish me luck at school ü§°
what holy grail, perhaps in braille, without fail, from the belly of a whale?
it's a separate NSFW channel, isn't it
I don't actually have horny jail
trying to get horny jail role I see
And now back to sleep gn
i want to go back to sleep üòÉ
Don't wanna sleep more
Idk
:Sleepy:
My mom was supposed to wake me up an hour ago luckily I woke up rn bc I heard my mom and brother yelling at each other :KEKW:
Oh u said history
@toomanyzs cuz you like screaming about this, how much of the case population need to be vaccinated for us to be "back to normal" on campus
i forgot the number
we got an email saying we won't need to wear masks if 80% of the student population is fully vaccinated
been meaning to rewatch but i dont have hulu
they said they need 3500 more or something
we need 3,260 more
ugh my next shot is on friday
can't upload until friday!
3260 is still a long way to go yeah
i was trying to say impossible in spanish but it just looks like i misspelled it
people are literally dying to get vaccines
i tried
really? gone up a lot since i last checked
unless u went johnson
for this upload
i got mine at the end of april
idk
I don't think they're going to require vaccinations
they can't unless it's FDA approved
i just wanna be in college
actual college
There's no requirement right now, instead, they are offering positive incentives for people to upload their vaccine cards
i wish they offered a 4.0 semester as an award sigh
No one would treat their grading seriously if they did that
one can dream tho
if you don't want half of your semester tuition paid for
then idk what you want then
60 percent uploading their cards is already very impressive, I don't think 80 percent of people on campus have even gotten a vaccine, so I don't have much hope that they will reach that goal
i just don't want to wear a mask anymore but like ughhhh
yeah i think those who were able to get the vaxx probably have
i feel like anyone else doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want / cant get
my friend at umd said that if they dont upload their card, they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go
not "easy" per se, but just  having a healthy mix of classes that won't kill you and might kill you
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be really sad if there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a mask mandate this fall
i anticipate chem 105 killing me
looks like you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be really sad
hate to burst your bubble but there's a good chance we might have it
i'm KEEPING MY MASK ON because i don't want to look like an maga idiot
i still wear my mask
still looking!
cuz i don't need to contract covid from anti maskers and anti vaxxers
ok! lmk if you have any questions or need help
They needa do a better job of advertising this stuff cuz I didnt even know we had to upload our cards till yall brought it up
Lmfaooo i didnt realize dawg
dragoness elizabeth doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a computer in her tower
time to upload your vaccine card !
but last year
then it slowly stopped
i don't need two copies of the same email
Hush, not in college yet
fuck i was so close to getting mine
we won't know until you show us
Why don't you tell it to the class
Brass, unfortunately, not as effective
Strings, yes if u work with an assemble
My friends have been in possession on my card multiple times. Heck I even carried it to school
And depends on what u r trying to do
I once took my SSN card to the covid vaccination place and the guy saw it and was like "no no dear, cant have that around"
why tf do yall do that like can't your identities be compromised
He didn't say dear cuz he was like 23 but you get the idea
Why would anyone do that tho lol
once a scammer called me to confirm the last four digits of my ssn
i didn't reveal that i didn't have one until five minutes in
Yes but they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re my friends they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t commit some fraud üòÇüòÇ
ugh the department of state has been EDGING ME FOR 16 FUCKING YEARS
cuz idk why my friends would need my ssn
raunak what the fuck
Also my friend needed to register for vaccine but he wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t getting any slots so he gave his aadhar to me so I could do it
Idk why y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all are so secretive
no i was never born
cuz our ssn's are very delicate
We don't even know if we exist
Man u got some good friends cuz u never know what ppl would do with that they could lowkey ruin ur life, credit, etc
Lmao I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even think of that
@raunakwastaken nothing wrong with what your doing
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all so scared of upsetting each other
i don't trust my extended family members *that much* that i would send my ssn's to them
its not that i don't trust my family members its that some of them are clumsy as hell
im not gonna get into it but in short i don't think i'd trust them
most notably the asian american evangelical christian type who falls for phone scams
Nothing wrong with it, there's countless stories of people's parents or close family making credit cards with their relatives SSN and info and fucking their shit up
Damn really that shit happens?
not in my fam tho
everyone has petty family members so you never know who can turn their back on you sooooooooo
i just don't know my extended family enough
idk if i can trust this new friend with my secrets
idk if that made sense
@raunakwastaken my fam and i went on a tour in cali 10 years ago and the tour guide asked my dad where we are from and my dad DEADASS said new delhi
I'm just used to saying my ethnicity my bad
Okay damn.
raunak doesn't see race or ethinicity √¢≈ì¬®
Nothing
Nope
indians have really weak eyesight (FOR THE RECORD RAUNAK THIS IS A MF JOKE)
i wear glasses ( I'm not indian but i feel like the joke still appliess)
i wish i got contacts
sigh raunak
or different frames i realized i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually sick of mine
i was tryna act like a fool ok you know what lets drop it cuz online communication sucks
My bad
what wasnt a joke
I thought cuz raunak doesn't get joke
When Priyanka tried to make a joke but the entire server is confused rn
y'all need culture
to keep modi's heart ice cold
How do you crunch on non-existent ice tho
Rip
Ain't modi a bitch?
You are wrong. She is a meanie
The reality is though I show I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m strong but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually a softie
And I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say this as a gentleman
nothing relax
Since when did Indian aunties become nerds
Lonely nerds actually
Live by discord. Die by discord
I still prefer WhatsApp
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have its notifs on
actually i don't even think its fair to compare the two
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
But I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stream that much if at all
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t swipe on iMessage
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there a major issue with WhatsApp√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s new privacy policy though
Even though I accepted itü§°
Well i like WhatsApp too so idk
also idk why their android interface is crusty af
i never use whatsapp
iphone supremacy
Omg the emojis on WhatsApp are terrifying
Wrong.
The fucking ü•∫ is just wrong
sorry i didn't mean to be rude there
I'm used to iPhones users with a superiority complexü•¥
Send me a text on WhatsApp and find out. Idk how to explain it lol
i dont understand
Oh üò¶
CPR/First aid is a phys ed class
why are they so popular though
I looked at past years and the PHED courses were not all full, so I'm speculating that the reason for the large demand for PHED courses is because COVID-19 is calming down
like i like myself some phed but damn
For example, I didn't do any PHED since I was a remote student for my first year, so I really wanted to get one for my first semester on-campus
Damn what about the first years
Isn't that required
> Opened in 2014, the Wyant Center is a good alternative for those who work at a location away from the main quad.
I don't know about the fall semester but right now Veale and Wyant are open 7 AM to 8 PM on all weekdays
holy crap wyant is so much closer to juniper
Cuz sportsball ü§Æ

track and field sounds fun but unfortunately i hate running
I was hoping someone else would say it cuz i don't fucking knowüò≠üò≠üò≠
Oh oh
god sages is so annoying
I didn't actually try to write it well and my instructor never mentioned it
Phones can be quite useful if you don't get addicted to apps that don't help you
i don't have enough words to get to the content of phones
Aren't you the one who has two hours of free time
can't be me
the photo actually isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad
Half of my essay is about how she does not account for any nuances in her argument
Her argument is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìphone bad√¢‚Ç¨
would be surprised if there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t more than 1000 parents/family in the stands
Except there wasn't 650 plus people
Oh
"high school said farewell to 217 members of the class of 2021 when they all mysteriously disappeared"
"we are too scared to find them"
My school didn't even do class ranks
i wish my school didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lol
Our school didn't officially but you just had to ask a teacher to figure out your class rank
i went to a public high school
not anymore üòé
Where'd you go instead
also teachers were really nice as opposed to my public school experience where most of them were kinda dead
Wish I had more of those in hs
that sucks a bunch
I too had shit friends before hs
competitive in middle school?
that's early
Exactly. Once in middle school orchestra I won this one thing or like my teacher praised me for something and when I looked behind I caught a glimpse of one of my friends glaring at me. Like girl, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s middle school orchestra ffs
They were like one of the prime reasons I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go to my state school
I'm pretty neutral about going alone to case
only like 3 of us are going far away; the rest of the class is staying in the northeast for college
Not a single person i know from school is going to mine and that is absolute BLISS
I had the "need a fresh start" vibe from middle school to high school
but at this point I don't think I'd need a fresh start
fuck it, I'll just bleach my whole hair white
That same girl almost committed to Case when she found out I was gonna go and when I tell you my heart physically raced when I heard she was considering it even though she always said she wanted to go to OSU
Oh hellll
shhh i said nothing
I SAID NOTHING
nope
you saw nothing
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it zach
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it
Oh

me: listening to music
phone: I'm going to randomly turn down the volume a lot
me: ok weird. *turns up volume back to normal*
phone:
phone: *maxes volume*
my old phone was so annoying with that
it's been a little while since I've used an IPhone
I dont think I'll change it for a while
I've never changed mine
i wish i could change my pfp to my face but i am uncomfortable with the people i have interacted with on discord in the past
Close
for school server
I changed my name color and my pfp often so i don't really know what people associate me with
I don't like the app patio, it's just so bleh. Discord it better. The people on patio tho seem nice
i like being able to search for messages and reply
also isn't the patio app *more people?*
we won't let you shut up
I forgot my phone doesn't have the processing power to look at emotes and listen to music at the same time :cursed_flushed:
Some can be tanner though
Im often told i don't look Bengali
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what i look like
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look Bengal though
I don't really think so bahaha, but a women did come up to me and my mom once and start speaking to hs in Spanish so.. idk interesting
That happened to my mom in California lol
No sigh.
I don't know how to respond to this
No they don'tüò≠.. do they actually?
Well.. that's not even hard
Aren't you just sam

They closed the bathrooms for a while
the teacher watches you shit
Omg
I tried a non nicotine vape once
It was interesting
But didnt get the appeal of doing it all the time
I find that people with abnormally long necks tend to vape
A vape that doesn't have nicotine in it
If you cant stand the smell of weed dont come here
uh oh

Rip sam

Blowing smoke rings is so lame

Doesn't matter the town
Damn
Here, you just go behind the chipotle
OMG
There's this really overpriced convenience store that sells low alc% liqour and cards like 30% of the time, and whenever I end up breaking up a party they always have the same like 5 *shitty* bottles
Alcohol is shit
Makes you feel bad
Makes you stupid
It just tastes bad
I have my last high school assignment due tomorrow
Zach hasnt been the the frats then
Im procrastinating it so hard
But they dont do anything
Her friends got her out before anything happened by she was laid out on the lobby floor
She had to go to the hospital
why the fuck would I go to a party
let alone a basketball party
Also if you *do* need to go to the hospital at case, if you call Case EMS instead of Cleveland EMS, you *Don't get an ambulance bill*
I dont want to do this project
Are they going to fail you
just don't do it
0% of my brain wants to do this
Yeah if I dont do it I think I dont get credit for 4th quarter
For the work experience internship thing

Flys suck

I haven't seen the movies in forever
Its been due time since I've had a rewatch
I'm sorry, I was wrong. But I was still right.
I still don't deserve forgiveness though. Those are some of the best movies out there
"i was wrong but i was still right"
I was wrong in what I did
But I was still right that you didn't get the reference
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been here since 2:30 and the ceremony started at 3:46
and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still calling names
You get the same experience being in a garbage bad while ur principal reads the phone book
That hurts
I feel like i pay attention more when im doing something else √Ç¬Ø\_(√£∆í‚Äû)_/√Ç¬Ø
Oh.
Shame
I would've used mine to say, bye bitches!
if you want to watch my speech√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.
i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve used my speech to try and get the mic turned off
Bro idk if i would say i got rejected by Yale
I was embarrassed after i got rejected by stanford cuz of how much people i toldüò≠
isnt that the one with jonah hill
they create their own school
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all apparently idk the alphabet
oh no
*It's still not gonna prevent me from being one of the last*
Is this an invitation cuz I can't go
I doubt you want to stand with me as I curse after every gust of wind during a 20 second exposure shot
Idk what that is but have fun
Graduation ended and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m now home sheeeeeesh
wrong reply sam
I replied to the wrong messahe
I'm very tired
I was like wtf :KEKW:
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m crying
wtf is this convo about
I don't have any film experience
I really want to get out but I'm so tired after work all day
I want to at least get to a mirrorless camera here in like 5 years
Damn
*because I don't charge anything*
I feel like I need to boost my exposure
That's hard because it's only one chance
But I couldn't find a model yet lol
Lot of them didn't have the level of training I had

Too cold

Damn
Chat has been taken over by purple
Nah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just a skateboarding ravioli with a bite taken out of it
kind of sad üòÉ
i do not want to discuss it in this capacity üòÉ
I won't spoil it
Is anyone thinking about taking ancient Near East and Egyptian studies
||i didn't get into that school anyway||
I was committed to another uni cuz I was waiting for the WL and May was approaching and I got in on the first round and I emailed said college a month ago that I was gonna decommit and they even emailed back saying they removed me from the list and I get a call about orientation from said college
They want you ü§§
Ion want dem :cri:
Capitol Hill is upper middle class neighbourhoodüíÄ
Still too close to the Potomac for my liking
oh my god is this what my phone sent
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so afraid I hurt myself when I come down from the bed
That's not bad
I think my only issue would be the height, cuz imma sleep on the top
Are the beds soft or hard
I choose to sleep on a carpet instead of my bed rn
I like hard surface
I hate jello bed
me when im about to sleep
It hurt my back and shoulder
It doesn't work
I mean I feel comfy on a carpet
Mistletoe has older wooden furniture but it doesn't clang like the metal. The metal makes it very apparent that your neighbors are indulging in carnal relations
the couple of times i tried getting on the lofted bed-
it shook
how bad would it be when people are doing [redacted]
A big benefit to mistletoe is that there is reduced sex noises, so you don't have to listen to awkward sex while trying to do your homework
That would hurt
meanwhile, u can hear ur neighbor while they're on the phone in taplin
I feel like sex in a bush regardless will end up with a twig in a urethra
We're college students
We're broke
Not if u date someone rich
u can also
√¢≈ì¬® not have sex √¢≈ì¬® 
but we be nErdS so y'all won't have a chance :GIVEMEYOURSOUL:
For me it depends on how much money ü•≤
as long as they're not broke and can afford dates then looks is the priority
i would not date giyu if he were completely broke
How about college loans
Zachary keeps tab on fucking
No, there are a large amount of people that go home after 2 months of college and dump their high school partner and come back wanting to fuck
Some ppl in my high school has threesomes since they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re in greasy man
So not a surprise ppl dump their hs partner and come back wanna fuck
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still dating
Basically 90% of hs dating with end up break up after senior year
What if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my fucking room ü•≤
What the fuck I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m consulting my current HKU friends
ofc u need peepholes
Idk how the new generation do it
You pay ur roommate to leave the room?
And leaving the room for a sec
If that's the time frame you're planning on then that's kind of sad
I just hope my roomie isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a chad who will sexc in our dorm room√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
idk HKD
i only know ILS and USD sorry
Oh
How lonely
Disappointed
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably going to sleep in 7 minutes
I need to wake up early tmr
I usually wake up at 8 or 9, so it looks like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting about 6-7 hours of sleep üò¶
I need to wake up at 7
Oh gl
do y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all still have school lmao
Go sleep Moses
9:42 pm it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sleepy time
I installed a battery app since Android doesn't tell me much and it says that my battery health is 83 percent :cursed_flushed:
damn
i wake up so late i practically have two lunches
i went to denny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s

||i totally didn't accidentally click "n" instead of "m"||
what about air?
this isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the lorax
please refrain from body shaming that poor husky
now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m perpetually sad and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all robin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fault
the eventual heat death of the universe will be your fault
everything bad that happens is to be blamed on robin
everything between the big bang and the eventual heat death of the universe will be your fault
who doesn't tho?
@eekhannah  I'm sorry üò≠
fair
oh shit i forgot that he was in that
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know where my danny devito image is i think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve lost it forever
I FOUND IT but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in such bad quality
never
why do you want me to be a delinquent
crime alone is boring
calling it an essay is misleading, just write, "Boomer time, Wife bad, phone bad" - author name
the op-ed the new york times published is literally just "phone bad"
i mean i guess theres no incentive to cheat right
its busy work
shit u rite
Idk bout u but spending money just makes me depressed for losing money
its busy work
they just want you to do it to do it
I need to see myself using a product every single damn day until I will even consider thinking about opening my wallet
I am generous with gifts tho
Maybe three cuz it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold in Cleveland
kill it
i should but I probably won't because social norms and stuff
there was a time where I didn't know who Candace Owens was and that time unfortunately ended now
Fuck that lol
it's pride month: gay is required
y'all should clean it up and adopt c:
my mom would never let us have two cats
i want a cat
I want a kitty
I forgot that's a thing
I forgot animal shelters existed :'0
yellow doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t vibe with my other roles
nothing against u
MY LAPTOP IS HERE!!!
I just ordered a new laptop 2 days ago
because I need that stylus support
i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like 13 inch laptops
you're lying to yourself if you say the xps isn't the sexiest laptop out there
I would've gone for the 15 inch but there was no stylus support
BUT SAME SHIT
but still plenty smaller than any other 15 inch laptop
14 inch laptop ftw
Im getting a new laptop too
Just don't know which
I was thinking about doing a 15√¢‚Ç¨ laptop but like I use one rn and not something I want to be carrying around
I could never not decide my own laptop
I put months of research into that
For graduation my dad gave me money to get a laptop but my mom and I are planning  to use the 529 account so thanks Dad will now build a PC with that :KEKW:
but xps 15 inch is like a normal 14 inch laptop
unfortunately no,, both laptops I've had with stylus support have proprietary styluses so I didn't have a choice
Samsung's styluses just feel like mush
except when it comes to ssd√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s
nothing, just wanted you here lol
Aww okayyy :)
i don't have naps often
I had 4 hours of sleep last night
Theyre always 4+ hours
I cant sleep when it's bright outside
Unless I'm sick
For once I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel groggy when I woke up wtf
I was rudely awoken from a dream when I kinda died
I died in my dream :'0
Oh bruh
Isn't it a good thing you woke up
Sam, how are we supposed to volunteer at the animal shelter
If you die
We would never replace sam
never replace sam
chrome hates me
It's the one application on my laptop that's slow
because chrome just destroys my current laptop
is there something I don't know about?
Have you never used it
It's like the bing of internet browsers
is,, is it bad?
Or worse
Just get internet explorwr if Yu don't want chrome
Omg
I just want my ram back
Sam type shit
shit
Crap
idk why am I typing shit
unfortunately I have to wait until like next month for my new laptop :')
I'm very hyped for it tho
Sad yeehaw
hold up i need to clear off my desk
I FOUND sad yeehaw
This is sad yeehaw
computer so fast
i used to be  a mac user
i know nothing
I haven't upgraded my computer in 4 years but it still seems to be good
i kind of hate the emojis
that'll happen
my mac used the default discord ones and i thought i hated that
quick tip: pretty much all emojis suck besides discord & apple
i got myself a gaming laptop in september of 2019 and its still working well
even then it's pretty hit & miss
Gaming computers tend to work well most of the time
Oh wow, did anyone else update Windows 10 recently and get this new Weather widget on the task bar? It's blurry :cursed_flushed:
our old desktop starts loud fan 2 mins after it's turned on :LAUGHING:
tbh I haven't used my laptop much since summer started
There are some articles confirming what I thought. Idk how they push a feature to everyone and the text is blurry, that seems very easy to fix and something that they would have noticed
and it's veryyyy slow
oh no the camera quality is so bad compared to my TEN year old mac
so very bad
yeah laptop cameras be like that
how does it still work
idk david
nah people dont need to see me in high quality :cursed_flushed:
we won't be using cameras nearly as much now
I would have taken a gap year if it was still online :cursed_flushed:
^^ that is my laptop
but ig i don't have much to switch to in terms of browsers
4k isn't really noticable for that relatively small screen
I just want a laptop that doesn't freeze every ten seconds
have you used a windows laptop before @eekhannah ?
I just need to be able to use a stylus
isnt that Moses's thing?
I'm not an artist tho
I find this to be a lie
everyone's thing apparently
i haven't actually used a Mac for extended periods of time so i wouldn't know
Using a Mac is like being dropped into a rubix cube and being expected to do work
Wtf
idk ive had a mac and a windows for the past 4 years and i definitely prefer the mac
My laptop is a 12√¢‚Ç¨ :PensivePride:
i used a mac extensively for the past 15 months
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just a computer ü•≤
id want a mac laptop and a windows desktop, not both windows os
oh no i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m frozen
The only reason I'm not a mac fan is because I've built my own pcs since I was a kid :/
just because being able to choose dumb gimmicks on windows laptops is fun
Microsoft is really glitchy compared to Apple in my experience
at the end of the day, it comes down to what you want in terms of hardware & software
honestly kind of missing the camera on the mac
for college, just get a simple mac
for computer science students and shit, you might wanna put some thought into it
besides the meh compatability with games, I could go either way with software, but i really do like the offerings of windows hardware, so that's why i swing with windows
but ultimately it don't matter it's just a computer
it doesn't have battery
@toomanyzs honestly I'm looking for a new laptop for college so thnx for that recommendation
gonna be getting as msi laptop that has a 1650 bc it doesnt drain as much battery as better gpus and the laptop will have 10+ hours
i have a 1650 in my laptop
and i wish I could tell the nvidia control panel to auto turn of gpu for basically everythign and use igpu when not plugged in
does it go brrr in the middle of class
My friends have not enough social skills and too much money and so they have 3080s
do you have to constantly be charging the laptop
yo what is zachs laptop
my laptop can charge to 60/80/100
wish mine did that
yikes, yeah dont want a laptop where im always having to be plugged in
Doesn't matter if you wear headphones. But like I was watching a movie on it and it didn't bother me at all
I'm still using a GTX 1060 in my desktop :cursed_flushed:
1800 for a 1650ti laptop with 10hr+ battery life :KEKW:
i mean i charge mine to 80% and it gets like 3 hrs battery if i use gpu for chrome and discord on battery
Is there a slim (not too slim) gaming laptop good for college?
im looking to get a 3060ti but ofc cant buy any gpus rn :CB_pepe_cry_music:
need some ideas
with decent battery life where you dont need to charge it super often? no
You want to be close to downtown and on the beach on this househunter
I don't want like a 7 inch thick laptop if you know what I mean
or just get like a laptop that supports an Egpu and keep the egpu in your dorm room
i want intel
I feel like a virgin even looking up AMD so I'll pass
Zach doesnt like saving money
this is the case I want for my desktop i think https://www.razer.com/gaming-desktops-and-cases/Razer-Tomahawk/RC21-01400100-R3M1
but looks low on air circulation from the cront
i don't think anyone competed this year
so i don't know too much
do you have the link to the discord tho?
only game I'd be willing to do competitively is Splatoon and I'm already enough of an outcast already
nope
damn
pain
never played it though
i am not a gamer but i mightve gotten a windows laptop because of my leftover gamer phase mentality
destiny 2 you cant really do competitive with esports
Simply dont play esports, ez
still armor/weapon stats would be too much rng lol
I haven't touched Overwatch in a hot minute while my for honor hours keep racking up
I hate myself for this
you guys want it?
i can't actually grab it
damn
You guys havent proven ur gamer√¢‚Äû¬¢√Ø¬∏ ness to them yet
I had 5000 hours in that shit
what? only 550 hours? I just checked
i think one time we spent like half an hour conga lining around a map
Their website doesn't give much info lll
"Only" 550 hours? :cursed_flushed:
Thats nothing
damn
it should be 5k tho because sometimes he just leaves it open overnight but it's still a *lotta time*
That's how many hours I have on discord
i probably have a few thousand hours on discord
I've already used it for 5 hours today
Is that on your phone or is there a way to track screen time on Windows or Mac OS?
phone
my screen time is embarrassingly bad
i have 7000 message results in this server what the fuck do you think
Over 10k hrs in disc
fair
I only spent 44 minutes on Discord on my phone for the last week
damn
I've been on discord consistently since 2017
A year ago, I wasn't even using Discord
my discord account is 2 years old but i didn't use it until a year ago
I had/have a bad addiction to discord maybe :cursed_flushed:
I originally used discord for one of my club study groups
emphasis on willing 
(I was the only one who wanted to play)
Don't ping people unnecessarily
except i'm annoying so
or you feel?
damn
i don't think so
i turned on facial recognition on my laptop and it is so Funky
and it doesn't work when my face is covered by my hair
i don't even know what's happening and suddenly i'm logged in
david i have literally told u things i have never told anyone bestie
I sleepy tho
still havent done the essay looks like hell
prob will do tomorrow or friday bc I cant procrastinate any more than that because Ill be in Hawaii when its due üò´
tomorrow i clean my depression room once and for all
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so bad
english is my first language tho :cursed_flushed:
I havent even starting thinking about how I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting my crap into my dorm üòî
i might drive my junior or senior year from cali so i can have my car with me *maybe bring a cat to apartment*
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get in saturday afternoon and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably want to sleep but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll explore campus i think
i could never
Mines kinda bad too
my adhd/anxiety would get too bad
Not that bad actually
I don't think anybody can beat what I got
only thing on my desk is gay stickers I havent put away yet :KEKW:
there's not even enough room for a mess
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even want to see a picture of my room
So far I sold 2 of the pens in the pictures
Have not touched flight sim stuff this year
Cuz I spent wayy more time flying the real thing
And have the pc on the floor
it's nowhere near
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ü§§ I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to get negative and chaotic  energy out of my life
:cursed_flushed: not bad but also not clean
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not bad at all
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO CLEANING IN A WHILE
For me my room is messy if I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hung my clothes in a hot sec
My room is actually clean compared to y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢alls
My room is slightly disorganized because I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hang my clothes
||but Alex won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t send a pic be he has all his furry costumes laid out ||
And they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re now wrinkled and will thus look worn down sigh
But I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have anything on the floor
Cuz u have a gf
||Took so long bc he was hiding his furry costumes ||
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to respond to this
Yeah don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Tbh Alex ur room is clean tho
Ofc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s clean
Cuz u have a screen only for discord
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a closeted weeb so you would never see anime stuff on my desk
I got weeb shit right on my desk
idk whats worse that or the book of fishes
We've gone over this
Okay I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve bad memory
Marry someone whose brother is a mlb player
So no pitchers u can find
Not China tho
He dead
I think its time I fix this sleeping schedule üò≠üò≠
never too early
Today I spent five consecutive hours recording
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even get one take I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m satisfied with
Those two alone are 15 minutes
my programme in total is 30 minutes long
I get my second jab tmr so that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s three days gone too
damn
I'm waiting for a train so I can look at said train because I'm desperately bored
I thought I heard train horn but so far no train
cuz i do
oh
so I went
train tracks make me feel nostalgic
because my dad√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hometown had a couple that ran thru and the noise just√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ memories
takes me 10 minutes to bike there ig
idk
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a train that runs thru my town but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like 4 miles away
fair
i like bike alone
I cant ride a bike üíî
my parents don't want me biking/walking outside alone
fair warning it will take practice before you get the hang of it @vrose7
I've had my fair share of mishaps while learning
oh i can't really bike anywhere (unless i wanna bike for like 2 hours or more!)
Especially true for Houston, you can't really get to most places without a car since a lot of places are 30+ miles apart
i mean, i live like 3-5 miles away from like every store i ever need to go to but we don't have many bike paths
i want to bike but my town is full of hills and it is tiring
except my city doesn't have a metro system ü•≤
i live 5 miles away from my local mall and the next nearest one is 10 miles away
my entire town is like this and worse
let me see if i can find a picture of the hill behind my middle school
oh gawd
this was to go inside
it was worse than the actual physical activity in gym class
in 90 degree weather
nah you def don't have to really give it up idt
idk but ik students did (based on what i saw on snapchat and instagram)
...really?
1.5 aint too bad
@sebastian7033 i could be wrong that there aren't places to skii/snowboard nearby
oh
which is actually common cuz ik many people who went there
If it gets cold it can freeze 2 the horizon
oh i responded like that cuz idk what else to say
when i tell people where im from they either go "oh ok" or "where is that"
columbus oh
i lost the game
sorry
never heard of them
damn
Basically back to normal except we didn't meet vax so everyone has to wear masks inside regardless
Last year they screwed a bunch of people out of dorm spots like weeks before the semester started
Not the freshmen tho, the upperclassmen and stuff
That was the right choice though
Not saying it wasn't the right choice, but if they were going to do it they should've given more time
will forever be thankful for single rooms
That's a horrible thing to do
Couldn't be me
High School sucks
Nobody cares and nobody really knows either
Thr government isn't really doing a great jobs so..
That's just too early
Only a handful of states are still asking vaccinated people to wear masks and the CDC says that fully vaccinated people do not need to physically distance or wear masks
Ohio's state of emergency will be lifted tomorrow, ending nearly 16 months of state of emergency
Requiring 80 percent vaccine card upload rate seems too high of a bar
I'd still wear a mask, partially because I don't really trust the vaccine
As in I don't think the vaccine is effective enough to warrant me not wearing a mask
I worded that badly, I have the vaccine guys don't cancel me
If they don't reach the 80 percent goal next year, will they still require masks for 2022-2023? Just shows that the bar is set so high that even if there are almost no new cases in America, they would still have a mask mandate
working for me too
What ever happened to ISIS?
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trust anyone
who said i'm awake?
Sorry that was kind of tempting
so don't hold me accountable :cat_gun:
time to find my phone
Aren't you using discord on a phone?
I use my computer, but the only other person ik who always uses their computer is Raunak
Don't quote me on that tho
phone = sacrilege
i mostly use my laptop for discord
Speaking of dreams, I dreamt last night that I got put into prison for 5 years (yes, 5 years) because I stole an iPhone
I just started reading the sages prompt and I already hate it
phone bad
Ah, I think we had a similar SAGES prompt last year
my dad: can you do this chore
me: *oh no! an excuse to not do sages*
~~while i have a computer~~
sam's dad: walks into the zhanda's house with a gun and without a valid carrying permit
Started working on sages just now
This shit too hard man 500 words is 500 too much for me
i would never
Cuz j saw someone with moderna monke
When is your essay due because from what I remember last year it was due at the end of May for us
I will be in there but I'm trying to fix :'0
guess sam isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually a cwru admit
i haven't started the essay
I was too preoccupied with my class schedule
I want to get the essay out of the way so I can procrastinate on my class schedule
*I'm trying*
so are you gonna get a new Mac laptop?
sorry howdy i caved
xps do be expensive tho :02Angry:
I would've gone with over ear headphones
i shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have even said anything
nope
I bought my laptop already used 5 or 6 yrs ago
Still going strong
hrs
Sorry, we would have gladly listened to your stories on your new mac
It does seem like I need an iPad
and from what you've told me, you didn't really have any reason to switch besides curious
im buying an iPad pro for school and a maxed out macbook pro whenever they come out
i bought an ipad 8 last week
im just gonna hope my 12√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ macbook doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t collapse during college
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about anything; just having an extra screen for reading/spotify/videos/note-taking üòÄ
*laugh/cries in working 60hrs a week*
i need to get a job
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve actually never heard sperg
zhanda i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to see that
**T**o think that Jesus Christ and

i no longer want to participate in this conversation
too bad
words cannot describe how much i hate that emoji
I didn't give you a choice
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not religious bc my dad wanted me to be religious :KEKW:
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
y'all have bad taste buds
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what maggots are
don't
Never had duck nor do I plan to
Tried some last night. Not a fan
my main motivation for not eating meat was the fact that my body wanted to unalive itself every time i consumed meat
my body needs meat or else I will continue to be underweight :cursed_flushed:
Never like feet even I lived in asia for 16 years
In a short period
Idt I can commit to being a vegan since I really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like almond/oat milk
I can definitely work toward becoming a vegetarian though
I need to eat as much food as possible or else I'll get dangerously underweight :cursed_flushed:
For me I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have fast metabolism
so diets are a bad idea for me
And u will feel the pain
I already feel the pain
speaking of eating,, I'm terribly hungry rn but have no motivation to eat
This was me for the past year because I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been activeüòÉüòÉüòÉ
That was me an hour ago
They mess up ur ph in ur stomach and makes u wanna throw up
Priyanka I feel called out
I swear once I get back to working out I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna start eating so muchüò≠üò≠üò≠
but this is probably the least I've eaten in weeks
adhd meds kill my appetite :')
Oh
I eat food and my body hates me
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take any medication on an empty stomach
If y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all get falafel cafe
U will eat even if ur not hungry
then I went on an hour long bike ride and didn't eat anything else til 4pm
Sam
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let this happen again
I understand it can be hard if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not *feeling* hungry
U will suffer if u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat
Oh damn hansum
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take meds and u can punch my belly
damn, compliments
i want my hair to be curly more often and i should probably start showering in the morning for that but
morning showers need wake up early
I should also start looking at products because am trying to grow out my hair super long
it started raining at my graduation and i looked weird the entire second half because my hair had conflicting agendas
My hair is hard asf and once my finger is bleeding cuz my hair sting me
i wish it were that ez
i need sth to define
Some commercial products are bad so watch out for those
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make my hair curly without using an iron lol
I wish I had straight hair tbh
i cant make my hair curly *with* an iron
~~and I forgot to shave for a while so I got a little stubble don'tworryaboutit~~
both my parents now are like: get it short
volume is sometimes very annoying
I've been trying to get my hair long for years and this is the longest I've ever gotten it before parents just force me to get hair cut
curly hair before i cut it
after i cut it my hair curly doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look nice at all so i just brush it out
still wearing the brown hoodie :cursed_flushed:
dw I still wear my Johns Hopkins ENGINEERING hoodie :KEKW: imagine wanting to be an engineer
if i dont follow through-
I feel so bad when I eat chicken it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally a guilty pleasureü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
NYU med school plz
all my friends hate to have their hair touched so :')
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it when people touch my hair unannounced though lol
that's fair
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like to be touched at all so i apologize to my friends but no hugs <3
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally impossible to happen again cuz covid
Oh ew wtf I was just talking about my friend lol
i like hugs but i also don't like them
I love hugs tho üòû
*oh*
Though since my anxiety has worsened I yearn for hugs even more
yeah it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse when they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re commenting on how great asian hair is
like idk how to reply
So I hug my parents and sister more often now
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never hug my parents
asian parents don't give out hugs üòî
they give out compliments, but never in the physical sense
I hug my frds mum tho
i forgot what mine is
I give mine hugs even though my mom finds it weirdüòé
**i dont want the convo to continue tho LOL**
Fair fair fair
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been up since 5 since I slept at 10

my mom likes hugging tho
whole student body penguin huddles
Asians don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to remind each other that we love our relatives because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s implied already
individual hugs just too personal unless we *really* close#
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not really into group hugs
CUT FRUITü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

Last time I was in Fresno I woke up to a supermarket rotisserie chicken

But fair warning
I'm Winston Li, 2024 student on the track to study optometry. I hail from the state of Maryland, home of the delicious blue crab. When I'm not doubling down on studying, I have an array of hobbies, including Cross country, practicing the harmonica, working on ceramics, cooking (with a focus on baking, and soon, tarts/pies), and recording audiobooks as part of a volunteer effort. I also work at the Kelvin Smith Library, located near Tink. It's great to see campus get so many fresh new faces, and I can't wait to meet some of you in the fall! Feel free to friend
How do you already work at the library wow
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t prefer any sexuality when I talk to ppl or make frds
Aw really?ü•∫ü•∫
i had an internship at the library but it had nothing to do with the library itself
if only priyanka was on campus in cutter last year smh :nkosad:
I never volunteered/worked at a library Oop
RIP CUTTER 307üò≠üò≠üò≠

Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cette nuit literally √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthis night√¢‚Ç¨?
Oui, mais cela pourrait signifier "last night√¢‚Ç¨
I remember learning it last year
i wanted to wait until i heard back from my last waitlist until i spent any money
I probably should√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotten a size bigger thoughü•≤
I looked through their website and couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find one that I liked üò¶
Oh
damn
I have never went shopping in the brick store except for picking up my items, so I am not sure about the discounts found at the store
They're better in store. They don't have everything on that website
@eekhannah I applied to gamestop and they told me to fuck off
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work there (yet)
oh no i accidentally applied to one that is four miles away
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just trying to make some money this summer
That's how I made money in middle school but with candy :p
also, pls specify which "animal" milk you want
never mind they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re for my mom
omg hannah you're gonna work at a food placeeeeeee
pain
i did receive a package today except it was *socks*
or a new laptop
the problem is that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to have 3 packages arrive from target today and i was not told my socks would arrive today
i don't
i don't shop much in general
i know my sizes at target because half my clothes are from fucking target
i think i bought one athletic shirt from target idk
we don't shop at target in general
I'm pretty sure I went there last week but I can't remember why :tired:
idk why
maybe cuz it's a littler farther away
the fedex truck stopped in front of my house, sat there for a few and then left
i need to call dunkin back
actually i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll call back after  my dad leaves for work (around 2) so i can say bye
damn
we don't take ourselves too seriously
so i got unnecessarily mad at target
there's always reason to be mad at target
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking my xps to fedex today
it was ~~apparently not~~ fun while it lasted
tho idk how much luck you need to get a doughnut job
nope
I unironically uwu, I don't have *that* much self respect
I don't :cursed_flushed:
isn't donut the american spelling?
that seems more American
donut doesn't even get a red line
can't afford "u" üòî
the g was taken away
the english language in general sucks
but i didn't
she says it is hard
and she wishes someone warned her
this is why i work at panera
our panera sometimes gets so busy omg
seriously
i can't pull off dresses ü§°
i do dress decently tho
won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t catch me wearing less than two shirts
unfortunately as a guy: 
outfit choices be like: none
Shoulda known it was gonna be some fucking bs üò≠üò≠
Literally nothing

you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re the one that picks the class though
i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to write on a college level deadass
I'm an awful writer
Oh Shit üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ

hannah did you do that yet

why reset your computer if ur gonna return it just burn the storage drive
damn i thought it was done installing windows
except thats the color  you chose to be here...
I wanted to have a color associate with my name in the server
*I have 4 hours left in this car ride*
Heard it was awful
Not really flexible with hours and nonstop working
Christ the sun isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even up yet
then it ain't morning yet
go back to sleep
do not want to work at the bell
how many fast food places did you apply to?
If u dont mind customer service/retail walmart isn't bad
I mean its bad but prolly better than fast food
though panera is rather close
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather work at dunkin
they might decide to hate me for leaving in two months though
as long as working there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad
They be ight they got money
hopefully places won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be severely understaffed come august
@eekhannah should've went with chick fil a
and work for a company that funds conversion therapy?
i mean i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how many calls i would get
3 of the places ended up contacting me within a few hours
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even working for 2 months at Panera
I almost forgot
hydrogen is really hard to wrangle
I was working on a design of a LOX/alcohol rocket for a while
never finished it though because uhhhh
don't have $20k lying around to build a rocket engine
just get money
shit u got me there
Had a friend who was also gonna make one, he even had some numbers. But I don't think he ever went with it
Also, isn't it more common for a high schooler to build a fusion reactor that consumes more energy than it produces, maybe u should do that instead :LAUGHING:
well you really don't need that much to build a farnsworth fusor
because you need deuterium and you can't get that at a hardware store
fair
shit im not good at that
so but seriously what are you buying
U can get away with more stuff
They'd probably be interested if they saw his work
Only problem is if u work for them u dont know what they're gonna do with those rockets and weapons u know
But given the moral implications of working for the military industrial complex
I'm not feeling too bad abt it
yeah i've actually made a pact with myself to not work for a defense contractor. if I work in aerospace it will be for a civilian organization
Designing flight simulators
i mean I kinda already have a job
Couldn't get motivated enough to open solidworks
I don't like solidworks
Too bad
In CWRU we believe in solidworks only, not cuz how much superior it is
It seems like they're the only software suite we're getting licenses for
I haven't even got to pcb design
Damn
I found the one I like and haven't thought about violins since until like last night
ah fair enough
Wtf
Idk I ate too much?
I went to burgerim
even weigh that much
oh
Oh
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink soda for that reason
I'm actually really bad at judging any sort of measurement
be it time, weight, distance
It's 0 calories anyway, doesn't break the diet
Yeah but still it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just bad for you
I'll get cancer from it, but it's still 0 calories
i can't even taste soda,, it's just fizz
u need one of these minicans priyanka
Soda = bad
ur missing out
I once went to the hospital because i forgot to drink all day :cursed_flushed:
Cut down
I'm missing in
Idk
that's a good reason to cut down
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna get myself addicted
me with family: 1-4 cups a day
me alone: 1 cup every several weeks
literally my tongue touches the liquid and i die
Idk how people can CHUG those things
I mean I like some fizz (hence only 3-4 sips) but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like flat
i can't have any fizz
But now I like it when the fizz goes down but is still there
You can pack your bags and leave. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the door √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù>üö™
Apple juice is ok but I still prefer water
Store-bought juice is really unhealthy
coffee bad tho
all because i had ONE bad experience after drinking three shots of espresso
guess what howdy? 90% chance i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m working at coffee place
Ping him you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Oh yeah true I get them but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink 3 raw shots of espresso
yeah no i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
carbonation painful tho
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like regular coffee
I've never had that before :0
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that :(
@eekhannah I wish your grandpa good health
rip zhanda
this anime takes a lot of mental energy omg
Spirited Away
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watched that one
I haven't spent my graduation money yet
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been so bad with my money
ehhh i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve mostly been buying dorm and school stuff and clothes
serotonin tho
and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really *need* more clothes i just like them
I don't need music stuff
well yeah but then sad chemical when no cocaine
~~my laptop was a graduation gift~~
i wanted a jazzmaster for a long time but expensive üòÄ
it really do be
oh no i have lost whatever guitar skill i had
ah rip
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t played in over a year
fair
oh yeah for some reason I'm really into the look of a 70's strat so I might buy one with graduation money
but it shouldn't be too hard
but you won't this time
oh yeah eye contact is just brrrr
I'm so unaccustomed to social convention that I seem confident
it was so awkward because my friend came up to me after graduation with his boyfriend and he was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbye hannah√¢‚Ç¨ and i said bye and walked away, then i realized i hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t met his bf yet so i ran after them, said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi just realized i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t met you yet,√¢‚Ç¨ shook his hand, and walked away
oH
in that context it is so bad
if hes having a party i probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to go
that's sad ;;
probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see her until move in
:0 early
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m driving 3 hrs to my grandma√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s friday afternoon, then driving 7 hours to cleveland early saturday morning
I cannot sleep *soundly* in a car
I had a 5 hour drive today
I tried to sleep
my neck: broke
Rip
I will go to any college but in state

i have a second cousin studying nursing at the university of akron

Hannah I guess your sister would hate meü•∞üëç
oh  *no*
Oh boi
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read the last part but oh well
sorry i read fast
I don't really have an emotional distain for religion but am very logic driven so that kinda kicks out any religious tendencies
formality: doing things because it's supposed to be formal (like ties) literally serve no purpose
Oh gotcha
I want it
that made me feel real nostalgic jen
oh no i was just about to overshare again
because it is the worst part of all of the disdain for life i have
what are the last two
also didn't i just mention like 10 minutes ago how I'm not religious?
dont even have a gpu added in yet and its already this expensive üò´  https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dbLgMv
U don't need to buy an OS
im in a few waiting list for a few different 3060ti√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s but yeah prob won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be for awhile üò≠
I paid way too much when rtx just came out but I got it right away

that dudes an absolute piece of shit
he deserves to be hit by a car *in game ofc*
smh my head
I built a mini itx, it's not bad at all
I built mine during discovery week
am also worried that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be a hard build to do as my first one
Just don't take the verge one as instruction
ahhh bc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so open
Any chasis that doesn't come with a box than can also be used to transport the built pc itself deserves a special place in hell
Tho my graphics card cooler gets quite loud sometime, really wanted to go for a costom loop sometime
yeah idk
and how long did they last
just sore arm
Second dose was so much worse than the first dose for me
had my second shot a little over 24 hours ago but now i feel nothing
my arm was sore both times and then the second time i had a really bad headache and a very brief fever
oh that's basically what i went through
upload card üò°
my vaccination card is still "awaiting review" üòê
Still waiting for the second shot
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re probably backed up or are simply slow
imma b honest, im not seeing any cod's with capes, and i'm feeling let down

I wish I was 30 minutes away from a beach
a lot of people like misquamicut but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
all my homies hate misquamicut. too far and not very good
westerly is the only town in rhode island that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in the providence metro area. westerly also happens to be very far away from everything for some reason
it was so nice i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll miss it
totally not a very long drive

Flute may be bad but try airplanes

ugh
oh?
idk if it's cwru
I still don't have a favorite piano concerto
So idk if it counts
idk i just saw the thing on the street
Tchaik piano concerto is awful
Nothing to do with the theme but how the first movement is structured
Tchaik is just bad at writing concertos
there are like 5 fucking stages
Tho u can't use it for the competition
i don't want to play anything past rachmaninoff
Well shame on u lol

This other thing I wanted to do is

But my piano sight reading still doesn't translate to my hands properly
Nope
i would never sightread bach however
I can't possibly conduct my own pieces
I can't play my own pieces

not saying he sounds bad but he's a very predictable and recycling composer
I invite u to my score study session before every Cleveland orch's concert
oh r u in the orchestra
Wtf

without knowing what's going on
That's how it should be tho
OMG THE INSTRUMENTATION
Is cuz recordings ruined the experience

cuz idk much
fuck
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find it
isn't string theory the one where everything is string
i don't get how people come up with this stuff
but probably not because i do not want to become a theoretical physicist
For someone who just took intro modern physics
yeah it's a shit show
i don't need an extra bravura section to kill my forearms
don't finish it
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to see people idk from my high school on my feed

Is the sages essay due the 25th
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t check rn
I think I'm gonna start work on Monday
Where u working at
i was going to work at a summer camp
i just hate brainless jobs
i get bored out of my mind
Is moving in on 8/15 mandatory? Can we move in a day late ?
my brother volunteers at a summer camp, he got stuck with like 10-14 4 year olds the other day :KEKW:
I'd try to be early rather than late. But that tends to be if you're international
Fair
retail/fast food would be not nearly as bad as lifeguarding, but I still don't think I'd like it
i want to work at dunkin
And the company you work for
Retail can be annoying only cuz of supervisors giving u stupid shit to do,a lot of shit is tedious
Yes 100% they can really make work tolerable
Well I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really talk to my coworkers unless it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s for work
Two of my friends from hs work there
Right really all u need is 1 person that u fuck with
It's the worst electronic device purchase I've ever done
But I need it for professional reasons, cuz certain apps, for whatever reason
So I can ditch my laptop all together
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like 2 in 1 things
had a bad experience with a 2 in 1 acer chromebook whoops
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trust them
but still put me off
i don't really need the 360 hinge but i do need stylus compatability
why is it raining
the bad experience was my cursor disappearing
what laptop you have?
finished sages essay and I hate it ü•∞
fits so well with rain
if only there weren't half a million mosquitoes stealing mu blood
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go outside
ok it's starting to rain more
I'm gonna get soaked aren't i
i mean it was raining pretty bad here earlier
take back the rain
I don't want it
i forgot i took the picture and thought that too
I think I'm actually doing bad but today has been eventful so I haven't had time to process vibes yet
goodbye Hannah
I'm kinda regretting not bringing my guitar on my family weekend trip because I use it as a mental escape and i Kinda don't have that atm and need it
Fuck music
damn
one is like, really bad
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve hardly used my orange one tbh
i got in december 2019 and stopped playing in march 2020
I stopped playing guitar 6 months after I started bc my school stopped the club
i need more people to obsess over guitars with
idk
I wish I could still play guitar, v depressing that I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t :(
~~i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve changed my strings~~
I've broken at least 4 strings
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve broken 2 but 1 of them shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have happened
a marker fell off my bookshelf and hit my gemini and broke a string; then i broke a string as i was trying to change them on my squier
brand new string i broke yes
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stupid
rubik√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cube down bad
I lost a piece
but it's a really nice Rubik's cube,, so I don't throw it away
i technically was in a band for like the last week of school
I'm hoping to find other people willing to start a band or just jam
just feel the music
because chords are hard to hear
but I'm somehow comfortable with guitar and i don't want to put in the time to learn anything else
I am trying drums though
definitely got a 1 on the exam
oh d a n g
I was joking how I can buy a car with it
music theory was one of the exams that was on paper for all administrations this year
I took none, skipped all my exams ü•∞
I took 6 exams :cursed_flushed: (if micro and macro are counted seprately)
I thought I'll need one eventually
I don't have one but
oh of your room
oh
i started the frq section and realized i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to do it so i turned in my booklet and left
yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve wanted to do that for so many tests but never had the courage
Zhanda don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss the jump scare lol
I wish i did that with my global history one
i wanted to walk out of music theory
Hannah, you should have poured a trail of gasoline behind you and set the school on fire
I still don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how that app works
you don't have one already?
I forgot to set it to private
oh no
I mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been doxxed so many times on there I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve kind of gotten used to it
That's doesn't even count as doxxing tho
Oh this was a public server with 11k members
oh damn
i wanted to keep my identity here a secret as long as possible but then my big ass mouth started talking about my last name
oh i do *not* act the same irl
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know who i am
if i used another social media, i would probably act differently there too
some minor alterations due to context but not really
so does patio suck?
though not really today it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been kind of dead today
in that case i probably won't join
that's like the opposite of what i want
so patio is where all the ppl who want to learn go
don't
Is it bad
Same, just tired as hell
Go to sleep Owen
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in limbo rn, no need for sleep
i work
why do you people never go to sleep
work
Speaking of sleep I was so well rested after my nap yesterday that I slept at 2 am and still woke up 30 minutes before my alarm
leaving for the airport in like 20 minutes :pog:
Stupid auto correct
I'm tired
can i do the writing sample in 45 mins before work
we still got like 5 days, right?
but i haven't heard of that yet
or idk lol
I haven't done the draft yet either hhh
oruh idk
It took forever because I passed out after work LOL
Like why the fuck are you sitting next to me
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re leaving ü•∞
wtf kinda boomer shit is this prompt
I didn't do any heading yet :cursed_flushed:
I didn't
Oop
tho it's just supposed to judge your writing ability so I'm sure it doesn't matter
Oh no :(
What happened
Omg YES 
I have to go to work üèÉ but I'm free after 6pm :D
damn i should√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve covered my cap in mini babies that would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been funny
I just want you to remember me   like this. Someone that was your friend for a little while
at least I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put sans
i don't play undertale enough
frankly i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think people will realize
the movie wasn't even that scary
I think she means mla format as in double spaced, 12 font size, times New roman font, shit like that
forgot mla format existed
mla more like
m go away
l hate formatting
a ss
oh
because she thinks i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a communist apparently
That was the only scary part of the movie tbh
haven't watched that
I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep for a month after watching that movie
The Nun was so bad that even I laughed during the movie
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch it
I think the emoji movie was one of the worst animated movies ever made iirc
Or something like that idk
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never watched it even tho I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve always wanted to
I just never found it on any of my tv channels lol
it won't be the last
Y'know, if i had a nickel for how many times that happened it would be twice and isn't it weird it happened twice
I cannot find it
you feel it
I was hoping so
And it's weird it's happened twice right!
Anuvi queen type shit
Oh well there are MANY other iconic lines
I've been rewatching all of Phineas and Ferb and I'm on the last season
I have like five episodes left
Worse than the tom and jerry movie? üëÄ
Watching those two have voices made me die a little inside
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watched that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think?
It is kinda bad
Or worse
Oh oh
Wreck it ralph 2 was bad, but I could sit through it. Emoji movie was disgraceful tho
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never watched the emoji movie
nope but I've seen 3 ads for it
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really watch movies
because it makes me anxious to be watching something alone for an hour and a half and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m really annoying during movies
I never told you how it went. I hated it. I literally forced myself to finish it
I'm sold
Everywhere else is bad
I forgot to tell him how it went!!
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have twitter because having twitter is basically just wasting time reading everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stupid thoughts that aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even entertaining
I just don't use twitter :cursed_flushed:
I used to be on stan twitter, and now I'm casually still up to date to what goes on because i still follow accounts. But really I'm there for news, memes and books and film
Damn
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on Twitter but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come across memes
THat's someone who doesn't know insta memes
Half of the reddit memes are recycled and stale anyways. Twitter and insta filter all the shit out even if they're late
Ew wtf
YALL CANT BEAT ME
Wrong
@kaori_flute I just remembered the time you slept and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t attend the TA session zack asked you to :LAUGHING:
oh
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen Zack on here in a while
@eekhannah why does RI water have to be cold
why does water have to be cold
because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold here
For those who need to take chem
You could take 113 in the spring though too
shit
jk you don't have to
too late
I'm jealous lol
Oh that's why you said the water is cold
I'm so stupid lol
i hate going to the beach because i always get sand in my booty
rip
tbh i wanna spend a whole summer when my friends just chilling at the beach but the social convention of hyperproductivity makes that hard
lowkey my elementary school crush
no one wants to see my pale ass body at the beach sweatin under the sun
Oof ouch, sams skin
oh no
but I don't burn that badly
In the short term tho
MY PLANE JUST LANDED
idk it looks cool, still inside the plane
im going to work tomorrow isnt that fun too?
the job is bad and im bad at it
I ain't
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already started it üòÉ
i just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sit and write for 60-90 minutes
Just remember kids, the sages "essay" doesnt matter, dont stress it
Dont b, its not graded or even looked at
Its busy work they toss in the shredder
oh the sat essay
i didnt do any writing for sat or act
i did so bad on that despite being a great writer üòÉ
Well its cuz it doesnt test ur writing, it just looks for keywords. I know a gal who wrote "george washington freed the slaves" and another who wrote, "the effects on this issue are minimal due to the time lasers from space" and they both got perfect scores
Dont be fooled
Work smart, not hard
Imagine taking the essay portion of a standardized test :KEKW:
couldnt be me
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to
i didnt have the option not to take it
i only took ap classes cus me and my friends liked complaining about how hard the material is or how shit the teacher is even though we brought it on ourselves
wtf is that emote
Why would there be a gorilla emote in discord. What major event was caused by a gorilla. Its a sad event so clearly its traumatizing. What couldve happened to cause the emote *think alex think*
gorillas deserve to die bc otherwise theyll rise up and take over the world
this killed me and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know why
omniman did nothing wrong change my mind
the meme is everywhere i dont think its really spoiling anything
That fight lasted like 2-3 damn episodes hhh
I work there

Going to case = a lost cause
Welcome to the lost cause club
I need to buy splatoon
I had one despite being at home the whole year
I literally never talked to anyone in hs
They only talked to me when they wanted their hw done
when they realized i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do their homework for them they spent their time trying to prove me wrong
I never did anyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s homework
I sometimes sent mine though and vice versa
we watch me slowly lose my mind
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remind me :(
The Smith people never talk hhh
I've never been there
i have a feeling im going to befriend them
howdy doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually exist
That's sad :(
I didn't realize we were going in order and was about to just say random months
*see, yk shes from vermont cuz she isnt saying anything*
i hate you
Isnt there 3 of them
tho 3 is coming out in a year
Better than splatoon tho, slime rancher 2
Nintendo sucks
Wrong ron
Western horror tropes aren't even scary anymore
What are some
Case stereotypes
Other than we are horrible at socializing
Working on hw fri noght
i was trying to think of some but all of them stem from not socializing
Lolololol yeah 
All of my coworkers say that Case students suck at conversations
that one hit a lil close to home ngl
its true tho
i aint finna lie though i be having to hold my piss in at night after watching horror movies üò≠

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a switch
i am poor i apologize for the inconvenience
I DID BUT I FORGOT MY HULU PASSWORD
Sad.
I would've but I figured I need to figure out how to work with roommates
david doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like ice cream?
because if I had a single, I would never talk to other people
i saw a girl trying to trade for a double because she accidentally got a single and i ??
Except 4 clarke
The southside dorms aint much better
My work ethic sophomore year üíÄ
i have a zoom at 10 shit
I have a lot of game suggestions if u want
I have all of those except mh rise
it's objectively bad
but I still love it
If you don't do it, what are you doing with ur life
i like to play games that you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lose yknow
Then again you lose if you watch S8 of GOT
Copanis want their monies
This is pure pain
I need to write like 300 bars by the end of summer
No need for silly notes n stuff
chords? sounds? no need
literally nothing but Jimi Hendrix has entered my ear for the past two weeks
I went from learning a shit tone of theory, from baroque to 20th century harmony, analyze the hell out of things
Cuz ur instrument doesn't make any
there's only do much you can do with theory
Never really been my thing
but you have to work for it
Oh no
last week of school I found people to jam with and it was so fun!
Smh my head
If u need to buy one
Couldnt b me
Hear me talk abt violins for 3hrs straight
Whats wrong with air
tho I only play my jazzmaster
I can't soell
I need an acoustic violin
Too bad
Everyone says mine is broken because of how it is shaped
Those CIM kids tho, I don't even know how they could afford a nice instrument
someone promised me ice cream a few weeks ago but i forgot who it was
sunny to pouring rain :cursed_flushed:
tho I love rain
walking in the rain is so fun
*rain plz go away*
It poured so bad
I wanna hike 
So bad
But i never have time
but still
@ambitiouslearner sound happens more in the head and the instrument itself
Specifically, the older violins that are in need of repair
So it has nothing to do with how the instrument is made
The standard for repair has gone up a lot in recent years
There has been some really horrible things done on famous instruments
I think people still don't know how he made them
In fact, some of them need wood patched back cuz the regraduation went too far
Yea well hate to say it but u read bs
People try to figure out something that doesn't exist
That's why they never found an answer
Cuz it doesn't exist
strad bad
I wish I could try a Strad out and see for myself
But, that would never happen lol
But after all del Gesu is my thing, cuz they look so damn cool
the gesus feel weirdly long
i like how they look tho
They r shorter than strads tho
Since I'm assuming dealers would just sell it to you at market price
Oh, how?
"market price" isn't really a thing with instruments
They r expensive cuz the makers r famous
And if it sounds real bad
tl;dr find a luthier to make it not sound like shit
Oh gosh I think I'm sick
I had a bad headache now my face is heating up
if you feel like a good ui but having to do a little bit of work to get apps to run, use mac and parallels desktop to run windows only apps
I think for college in general MacBooks probably have an edge
if you want apps to just work but a worse user experience, and are price conscious, get a pc. I recommend lenovo and basically only lenovo
except not everyone wants to deal with installing linux
i mean I ran arch on my desktop for a while but just didn't use it a ton
Even if u have a Mac
Overall tho, ppl here have xps, thinkpads, macs, and zebooks are common
parallels is better IMO, and bootcamp doesn't exist on M1 macs
Yea that's why don't buy them
Raunak, didnt you say the discount was thr same if you just waited for a sale :thonk:
Rip
oh
im exhausted but ik i wont fall asleep :wobble:
I just woke up cause sun was shining bright
while chat slow

Agreed
Sleepy sleep

play til your phone die then sleep
in that case don't do that
my gf broke up with me
I missed a 40% sale on something I was looking to buy since I overslept
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s p nice so far, rained yesterday but we planned to stay at the hotel anyway to wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad. Today we go down to the beaches and the pools at the hotel :))

Writing sample is so boring

Cut

i wanna go to an island away from people
that island would have a very big. fancy house
and i would be alone there
I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell you
alone? really?
why do people wanna live alone?
You don't have to clean up after anyone else
you can still do that
Living alone has it's perks
I mean I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna but I would have no one to live withüòÉüëç
Idk I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve hardly had any social interaction in the past year and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the worst thing to have happened to me
I'm sorry about that Priyanka :(, but i kinda meant for those who lives alone in like studio apartments. Who choose to live alone and such. Single room people and all
Honestly living alone can be scary
feeling good
NO my name is spelled wrong this sucks
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know

Perks of working at a restaurant fr

Decaf espresso lmao wtf

I'm currently measured at 6 feet 5 and a half
Damn

~~wish my mental health was this balancedü•≤~~
when's the last time you checked? :blurryeyes:
Ayo im long
My doctor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s office is carpeted so in their records I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a whole inch shorter than I am
actually my mental health is very balanced rn. it's just consistently bad
So when my parents measured me on a hard floor I was 5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢5
damn
Except I have black hair
but i won't
Once I was getting my hair cut and the lady said my hair has auburn highlightsü§°ü§°
sorry my english is terrible
bc i suck at both
its about the math 121/122/223/224 sequence
although i might take math 125
how can you suck at cwru you're not even there yet
last time i got my hair cut the lady said i have healthy hair :D
educated guess
Like apparently I have some redness to my hair idk
Luckily I do too but I wanna use actual good shampoo ugh
or at least i'll shave it off because trying to maintain a receding hairline is sad
he was just really stressed out ig
his hair isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even completely gray and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s almost 50 but he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very bald
My grandpa had black hair his entire life even though he went mostly bald
People thought he dyed it and suggested that he stop dying his hair because he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s old and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d go mf my hair is still black
rip grandpa miss you
she honked her car horn while pulling in the driveway, spooking both me and ny friend
only one way to fix that
I want one so bad

Alternatively just find me outside of Guilford
hi guys theres a bad storm here and my dog is under my chair
aww
Oh gosh this iPad thing is awful
Oh goodness
Fuck üò≠ my spelling is so bad
What ever happened to the counting channel?
And was never here
CWRU now has 65 percent of people with uploaded vaccine cards but unfortunately, getting that last 15 percent is going to be quite difficult
Gaining 5 percent in a week though is heartening
I wonder if they're saying 80 or broke because I wonder how like 76-78 would round
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to wear a mask at work but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to regardless :)
it's so scary seeing people not wear masks indoors at places
oh yeyyy
So why haven't I received my 50% off tuition yet
Nope, Houston Premium Outlets in Cypress
yeah good job do you want 1/2 a year of tuition?
It's important to wear masks even if you are fully vaccinated so those who have not received the vaccine yet can also be protected
my dad isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fully vaxxed yet so i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m choosing to wear my mask to protect him :)
Wtf and u didn't stop by and say hi?
UBI tho do b looking spicy rn
The constitution doesn't stop me from buying what I want
Land grab is in the nature of any geopolitical power, only stupid media like NY Times will think it's some sort of communist conspiracy
They will pay for wwii in blood
If muricans aren't there, China would have already built trade coalition with Japan and Korea like 10yrs ago
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna be honest I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about Nanking until like 10th grade

Zhanda now I know why people were leaving the last server
Initially I thought it's cuz my cum jar memes
Zhanda I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared :TE_MonkaShake:
but they were talking about cursed things even without him
It was stupid but there are so many good quotes
Don't look up what that means but I doubt you'll find anything
It says it means ur mom is dead
Don't guess
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what kkp is and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna know üòî
I never text in Chinese üò©
I don't think there's a slang for white people
Wtf
I don't know how to spell it
Oh
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that one
But basically yeah because she and I were working together and we handled an incident and she yelled at these kids because they were saying some shit they thought I couldn't understand and they thought she couldn't hear
Ang mo isn't derogatory tho
I don't think there's much powerful words against foreigners than  just regular slangs
I can't imagine they'll use a specific one for u
@wolfeee2156 sorry, you're the only white person I know
U know :bob: tho
There aren't enough
@Deleted User we finna swag surf our way to Taiwan and Japan and burn their shit down
Not my friends anymore ü•≤

They turned Gerrit Cole and Verlander into cheaters
But I don't wanna get sued by real Bob

I will again state that this is an Arkansas hate account
I know someone from Arkansas and can confirm this
I went to West Virginia once

Oh

Never heard of it :yumyum: :PensivePride:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to get more into fiction
I really liked the ending of glass castle though
vs westover who did it without her parents√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ permission, still going thru everything, just felt very incomplete in my opinion
I guess I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be reading Westover then lol
@alexthedawg have you read what the eyes don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see by mona hanna-attisha?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a really slow reader lol
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read that many books a year
not really a memoir and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nonfiction but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s incredible
Just mercy is super good though, if you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read it
i havent read in awhile; my instagram bio is starting to lie lol
Same energy except darker
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t found much recent fiction that has caught my eye and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m looking to resolve that lol
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read modern lit for a bit because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like ya lit but i feel like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m beyond that phase of my life now
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even remember what happened in that series
divergent wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very good
My friend wants me to read it
Hunger games was straight up bad and plaigarism, I will be taking fight offers

that's how he has so many near death experiences
i feel bad for jerry
Rick√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nihilism is admirable at times but idk it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard to always √¢‚Ç¨≈ìrelate√¢‚Ç¨ to this character, albeit very well written
don't you watch nat geo?
I watch Rick and morty but I almost never ever ever ever discuss it let alone slob over it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cock like their fanbase does
It makes people feel smart and that's the whole point
It's targeted for jeerys so they can feel like a Rick
leave jeery alone
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to actually understand the physics of wormholes to watch the damn fycking show
To be fair, you have to have
Are you a part of it because it seems like it
if you needed to be smart to understand r&m, it's current fanbase wouldn;t be able to watch it
Bruh I tried to watch that show on Netflix and hate it
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
theres sex in the show but the show isnt about sex :shrug:
you sick ducks
(Brian the DOG)
I know. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve watched some of it. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still a dumb show in my opinion
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a weird show
And boring too
I got bored quick
i wont body shame the characters for having animal bodies üò§
Are you lame
anything 1-2 hrs i'll listen to as i work on stuff
im sorry
i thought you were stalking me OMG
no theres a short story about a woman who stares at a wall and goes crazy
you scared me half to death you should be sorry
You basically end up arguing that the patriarchy sucks
I should be SORRY bc YOU dont know your feminist literature?????? üò°
√¢≈ì¬®the patriarchy√¢≈ì¬® and that science was nothing back then
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been exposed to that many short stories
There's still a long way to go
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m saying
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired
i mean all you said was that there was patriarchy historically and that it's still there to some extent today
it's kinda hard to disagree w that :shrug:
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m naming all the short stories
i can do that if you want
We can't winüò©
just kill all men
Bye bye
dammit I wish I still had nitro, I had the perfect emote for shooting yourself
oh
look away!!
Oh fs
Not saying it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gone lol
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still there
i mean if you're killing all men i'd like to go first before everyone i know get;s killed
I didn't suggest itüò≠
i wasn't referring you
i literally slept at 3 am last night because I thought the nun was coming
You didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even see the Nun horror movie tho
oh I found a replacement for my emote
I just watched a Stephen King show and I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep until I knew what happened to the villain lol
For me, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s usually worse after I watch a horror movie as well
nvm I lost it
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to get over my fear of them
I feel like a fear of them is understandable
My friends watched it, they said it's not that scary
id like to go last just to make sure all men are dead :NoTears:
i am so tired

Fuck Nixon, or Reagan. Whoever it was
Fuck Nixon too tho
reagan was hot id fuck him ü§∑
i hate him more than trump
idk if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m allowed to joke about having a war √¢‚Ç¨≈ìon drugs√¢‚Ç¨ without Zach writing me up
i definitely hate trump more than reagan
he doesnt have ra powers in the summer
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what he would have wanted üòå
i hate ronald reagan !!
reagan was bad but honestly i hate nixon and trump more
theyre all bad
*Gets to hell* 
WHERE IS SHE? 
WHERE THE FUCK 
IS FUCKING MARGARET THATCHER
At least Nixon just wanted money
ding dong the wicked bitch is dead
if ronald reagan was still alive √¢‚Ç¨¬¶
||he wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t still be alive if you know what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m saying|| /j
Good thing he isn't, he would've looked like this mofo
was he evil or was that someone else
Wrong chat but ifc
Idk why would we idolize the royal family anyway
who wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
it didn't work out pfp wise tho, too dark
it feels oddly familiar
I don't get it
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m technically only half freshman
Moses already scarred me with what he said a few minutes ago
what the fuck
raunak smh my head
ive already said too much before so i don't need to say much more
Cuz speedy eyes
oh shit i didn't think of that
don't tell him shush
It's after hours
crackhead hours

Is that supposed to be a flex?
When we learnt about Judaism in middle school we learnt that your sheets have a hole in them
What the fuck lmao
Was that the last straw üíÄüíÄ
why the internet literally exists for that
see legally i was supposed to have health class in middle school but we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it
do you think i could sue my middle school for this
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m kind of broke
I spent all my money on pianos
I bought literally nothing
there are two pianos in my house that my immediate family didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pay anything for
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had the same $2300 in my bank account for two years now I literally don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use money
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve spent a LOT of money in the past 2 weeks on clothes
Dawg im ngl ever since shit started opening up, the amount of money that I've spent... close everything down again
feels so much like my ns3 it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s insane
Fuck lol speaking of ensembles
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m done spending money though i think
Keyboard ensemble clashes with MATH 125 so I might just take MATH 121
yeah idk if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll let me into keyboard ensemble again
also I suck at classical which is an issue
I just play whatever shit I find online
idk if he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in any ensembles
idk what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing either
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been playing a lot of Mozart lately
My concerto no 20 is still rusty af
everything classical for me isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just rusty but never tried
so just a pile of sheet metal? idk a good analogy for that
Damn so just fuk sleep huh? üò≠
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
couldn't be me either :Culture:
you are somehow awake and asleep all the time
My mom is so pissed rn. We are getting ready to go drive for 5 hours and she was trying to make food and when she pulled out the cream cheese from the fridge it was frozen. :KEKW: :KEKW: :KEKW:
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to keep it??
i just feel very confused
i tried to return 3 items and it just told me that
A lot of companies do this since sometimes it's cheaper for them to just let people keep stuff instead of taking it back. If people try to return stuff too often, they probably just won't let those people keep returning then
For example, I rented a book from Amazon and it was kinda broken, and they refunded it and let me keep it
*they dont want to risk you infecting/contaiminating the clothes*
They probably care about having to spend money washing them from rona, then spending money shipping them over to a warehouse, then spending money shipping them to another store, and so on...
And now my mom is mad at my brother and me for not bringing something she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even tell us about like... if you wanted us to bring another bag that had stuff in it... tell us... you weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even carrying anything.... just your phone and a coffee... like
well fuck
im crying rn
im dad
what would happen if we all signed up for men's varsity basketball
yeah they really didn't need to create softball
they would kick you out, cuz its not actually a class
coulda just stuck to women's baseball smh
idk if this is right tho
how did softball become mostly a girl's sport tho
cuz baseball was for men
didn't know there was actually no gender rule for softball?
I just play the sport
I don't know much of the history
I guess baseball was too hard for women? I don't know. trying to look at the physical differences between genders
it looks like it never caught on
"By the 50's, many people had TVs, so they stopped going to see¬†softball¬†games. Men's fastpitch was all but abandoned, because they had an alternative in baseball. Women didn't have a baseball league, so they continued to play¬†softball. Women didn't have a baseball league, so they continued to play¬†softball."
still funny how you signed up for it tho
well, that class ended at 11:40 and my calc3 starts at 11:40
i had a feeling that i wouldn't be able to make it for calc
imagine not being able to teleport
just run really fast
imagine not being a math major
Math √¢¬§√Ø¬∏
I don't like the sound of that
yea, you'd need a drill for the hole
I cannot find my kazoo and I am panicking
Do you guys ever wonder if your FBI guy is 37 and stationed out of Reno and was charged with a DUI 9 years ago and has to work for the FBI due to the community service portion of his sentence?

@everyone if you need help uploading your vaxx card, hmu and I'll help you

yeah its terrible
my writing was bad
Don't expect everyone to go all out
I'm all essayed out after college apps
my writing itself wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad because my writing is never bad but the way i *structured* it
I wish I did that @toomanyzs
But I'm broke so
Everything about mine was bad. Only 3 paragraphs, no conclusion, probably not coherent. This is why I'm registering for foundations üòî
i picked topical despite mine being bad üíØüòå
I mean not only do I want the easiest class but also my writing kinda shitty though :uniqua:
I tried Colby jack the other day not bad

In my opinion Colby jack and pepper jack are the worst cheeses
I never tried muenster

I've had blue cheese before and it's not that bad
Bleu cheese is awful
Asiago is awful
Almost fell in that trap
Isn't it made with maggot shit

imagine not living in the middle of nowhere north carolina and being able to fire rocket engines in your driveway without the cops showing up
or maybe you need to stop judging the city's sleep habits

Idk lol
I'm sorry abt the person I unjustly shit on
Whod u shit on
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i shit on anyone in my speech  (at least not intentionally)
because i had to sign a document saying i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t offend any member of my school system and i was threatened
i did imply that my elementary school teachers weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very good at making me feel comfortable by uplifting my fourth grade teacher√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s efforts oops
i def was not a valedictorian so i wouldn't had had the chance to give a speech with or without covid
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not that smart i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know how i got here
my school√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s college readiness score on usnews is literally 11

bad
oh
idk what my school's is
for college readiness
oh damn
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel ready this is fake
i don't feel ready either
not bad not bad
idk if this is the right thing im looking at
so idk what that means
oh the graph under
I was salty that they didn't give me this scholarship
Not for the money cuz it's barely anything
I hate this graph
my school is rated 43.17 overall
homes in my school district are in high demand cuz we're apparently really good
where are y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all getting this scorecard tho
did you shit on victor
I don't think so
but compared to west coast and east coast schools my school isn't that diverse
my school was...
99+% palestinians :LAUGHING:
whites were the minority at my school üíÄ
can't relate lol
I feel like mine is even but doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really explain how
and go back home
oh üíÄ
yeah, the freshman cs is pretty even tho
Damn SAGES did not teach me anything about critical reading then
my school :cursed_flushed:
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dox my town lol
Omg I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so stupid lol
rip
you have nearly twice as many minorities compared to my hs
gender distribution is 50/50 tho :cursed_flushed:
how does one define college readiness tho
im in college and im still not ready for it
yeah seems like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all scores
1 on niche tho ;))
damn
Lmao I couldn't even find it when doing the commonapp dawg üò≠
there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a lot of high schools in my state
so 35 isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very good at all

But I went to america after freshman yr soo
was founded as a technical school???? idk if that matters
I was legit hurt like damn
idk bout that
0% of my senior class went to ivies this year
one girl got into 2 but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go
we have three kids going to harvard, like wtf
1 person went to Case though ü•µ
according to niche my HS is #1 in the state although it sure as hell didn't feel like it, I loved the teachers but so many of the kids were just complete assholes, like i don't even know where to begin
where you can see how many ppl each college accepted
Yea but I didnt know naviance did that üò≠
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dead
damn
we send about 12-14 kids to duke every year, but partially because everyone's parents work there
that mf was banging hard
I didnt know naviance did all that they just told us that we use it for transcripts or whatever
My school was not rich dawg üò≠
My school had to sell busses last year lmao
my school cafeteria is $30k in debt, I dont think we have funding lmao
We don't even have sidewalks
aw 10 ppl got into case this year
I missed out on 7 classmates
@alexthedawg post this shit on your door
it's a cool spot, cost next to nothing because for some reason people don't want to live here
the other two peeps from my school aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t on patio/discord (to my knowledge) so
if this one kid next year goes to case i will never forgive him
god premed kids are so annoying
really ?
3 were bio premeds. way to be boring
you've never experienced public high school if you haven't had to walk home üòî
Of my high school class there are 3 left, me included, that are premed
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not walking 2-3 hours home-
it used to take me 20 mins to walk home from school
I stg I see some kids driving their Mercs from Southside to PBL and I want to key their cars
not a lot of people are going to college in my class
oh AND nursing
respect though
Even if it's not necessarily the best choice to have a child in high school, it still takes tremendous effort and courage to sacrifice hours of your life raising a child while earning a college degree
@samrobot Aren't you a Data Science major?
though I was considering it
Dem walks were fire tho
That was the only bad part the hills üò≠ dawg they killed me

Berry bad
@sir_sammy once I was awake for almost 30 hours and had to drive to Columbus by myself.
Columbus is a 2-hour drive though?
What about the other 28 hoursüëÄ
Almost 3 and a half hours @sprinkles2108
The longest I've stayed awake is 36 hours. I don't plan to do that again
And I was there until 7 pm so about 40 hours of no sleep
i think ive probably been awake for about 36
(though i took a 15 minute nap during that)
Wait aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you in NE Ohio? Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that 2 hours away from Columbus
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m lost so do you live on the NE tip then?
Yeah my b I never consider my distance from downtown Columbus
On a day where traffic isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad (like rn since I was just near OSU today) it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s about 2.5 hours
Yeah I clicked avoid highways @sprinkles2108 because I didn't want to die that day lol
It's about 2.5 hrs with highway
My parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me go on long drives by myself
@ricorat I didn't sleep that day
my friend still doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve cancelled our plans üòÉ
i still haven't mustered the motivation to do such things
if the sentences say, "phone bad" u can submit it, its all the lady  says
Says the man so paranoid he disabled the microphone on his phone\
cuz lazyness go brr
it's so bad
i still have to
Half the effort is getting started
i did all of them last week
i don't even know who kanna is:pocky_4d_kanna_fire:

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing good and Hawaii is super fun. Wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t on my phone for awhile yesterday/today bc my mom took it :KEKW:  :))
a few times but not enough for her to take my phone. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just too snarky in general :KEKW:

Y'all I ran out of jokes for Bob
In urgent need for contents
*he's got nothing*
i have work at 7 tmw i need to go to sleeep

nope not at all. that's why you don't say anything instead >:)
i have no uniform yet
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to be there for 8 whole hours tomorrow
and 8 hours on saturday
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an adult so they can overwork me all they want üòé
Why are you working 8-hour shifts bruh
Money
i work a 5 hour shift on sunday
I work 5-6 hour shifts a few times a week
I work for 5 hours on sundays too lol
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work at all in high school
i thought we didnt sleep
i feel so betrayed
Like if you want to wake up at 7 and you want 8 hours of sleep, you have to be asleep at 11
i guess...
To Hannah im prolly not gonna sleep till 1-3
I just cant sleep early man idk how ppl do it
yesterday i went to sleep at 12
thats early for me
it was really good sleep tho
i should sleep earlier from now on ngl
i also went to sleep around 12 last night
i dont have any 8 am classes
I used to be able to run on 4-5 hrs of sleep
I can still but I need about 2 energy drinks
if i know waking up so early would make me feel miserable
i wont force myself to do so
i mean, do it cuz you wanna
is the writing sample due tmrw at midnight
my english prof said to take a night class at least once. hes like " its a different experience and feels so mature. "
U still didn't do it I remember u talking about it b4 üò≠üò≠
Undecided rn but im looking at engineering and technology i just dont know wtf I wanna do
And figuring out which classes to take is kinda annoying cuz idk where im going
Though rn my latest class ends at 6:05 pm this fall I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s considered night
5:30 seems late.. ig
starting
Oh
idk, just in the evening
Yeah no I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
it was really just a suggestion from him
I would simply be too tired by then
There aren't even many night classes offered at CWRU
then night classes wont be for you
No need to enroll
cuz my french class only has 2 open spots
Sadly, no :(
and ion rly wanna lose that
That's what I'm worried about too
oh fuck no, remember picking our rooms?
it was all gone in six mins lmao
I don't think we are supposed to tbh
you cant, just put it in the cart
good job, me and my roommate spent my minutes discussing which friggin juniper room we wanted and then when we clicked on one
gone
damn a single
will you be working during the fall?
Omg yayyyyy
They charge so damn much, I can't help giving a little extra
bro the fuck.
I want 
Cocaine
OH

oh THESE?
ikea cones just seems appropriate
that is still √¢ÀÜ≈æ tho :thonk:
omg really?? I'm in 306!
A smith buddy omg

idk if you're on the Patio gc but there's a Smith chat

I- I need to get Patio rn
bye üò≠

Don't miss out on the opportunity to spread the word on patio!
I was about to commit suduku in shame
god wouldn't have given him such a divine bod if He didn't want raunak to use it
i dont know what to say to this.
we're starting an mlm
From the College of Arts and Sciences to the Case School of Engineering, our homework solutions know no bounds
I will do your homework
I made it to promote a haunted house I built in my basement and it's dead now
And I will do your homework
can i swap the member exclusive content for more homework tho?
You need to market us a lot for that
lmao didn't we already try this
i don't get it
i want mars
bye!
bye sam
What even is sleep
Yeah but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to see how many hours each course is worth
Oh
Mostly 3 though
Where r the math classrooms and the bio classrooms
Idk
I feel like this was answered but I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find it
or just leave one of the days open
draft is due tomorrow but actual registration is end of July
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t schedule anything from 12:45-2 pm on any of those days. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why you have a placeholder
Why are the classes so short
Fr the 8 am lab shit pisses me the fuck off
I gotta actually fix my sleep schedule üòî
i have work today
idk where the calc lecture is, but recitations can be literally anywhere on campus. biol 214 is typically in strosacker auditorium, which is in the quad
but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m assuming that calc lectures will be in the quad as well, if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re taking math 121 that makes sense because chris√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ office is in yost hall, which is *also* on the quad
they only had large and extra large and my manager was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsorry pal√¢‚Ç¨
its such a boring article
like mine was over 500 words so don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t beat yourself up over the length üíÄ they really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
i love her but miss girl start ur zoom pls
The essay doesn't even matter one iota lol
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even remember writing an essay
Bruh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recall writing anything about phones
There was one for intl students tho
Like we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve said a million times, it literally doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t affect you at all
Six months from now, you'll be laughing and wondering why you ever worried about the essay
I forgot I even wrote that essay until I got to this server
Haven't even opened the sage module and began writing
feeling like a productive member of society

someone ordered a sandwich with only turkey in it

I saw a grand total of zero bugs in my room last semester
I got these times all wrong- 
It's 2-C today 
And Sunday 2:30-7:30

Omg that scared the hell out of me too 
And it was pitch black at night üò≠üò©
I almost threw my phone
Hhhhhh I'm about to go to work 
And work until 11:30 pm üëÑ
I can play tomorrow though
I only work 5 hours :)
that's still a lotta work :'0
I feel that this shift length is longer than it has any right being
9.5-hour long shift???
2 hour long shift??? 
that's too much
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m out of work
I am still here sadly
6 more hours of scooping ice cream that I don't get to wat
i worked 8 hours yesterday and today

Idk Zhanda told me he's bald
i don't remember what he looks like until i see him :LAUGHING:
i need to sleep
have work at 8 tmw mmmmm
Wtf and u told me he's bald
i just doubt everything zhanda says and go from there
what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that supposed to mean
That you will lose more hair than Howdy
i thought you were prophesying me shaving my head
You'd never know what you might wanna do tomorrow
He wasn't bald üò≠üò≠ howdy has hair pffft
i need to go to sleep
I still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put a face to Howdy√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s name yet
I was tossing those things like rag dolls man and I was the only one changing them
I'm gonna feel it in the morning
He won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even introduce himself we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll converse once and boom
That's literally what would've happened if howdy hadn't told me he was the one that waved and stuff
I literally would've never known
Oh stop, the compliments are going straight to my thighs
I still haven't tried the mango sorbet itself 
But mago sorbet with vanilla bean in a shake is top tier
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve tried anything besides the mint chocolate chunks
I usually stuck to mint 
And then I experimented 
And I never pick mint anymore
well I'm still sad from breakup a week ago but there's not much i can do about that ig
Just ride the pain
Feel it now, so you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel it later
working on that part
Was it a bad breakup
we both still talk
no hard feelings
Just sad that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s now like this?
it certainly felt bad
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
Oh ofc
yee sleepy time :nekouwu:
ye I've been reaching out to friends irl to keep me company a lot so it hasn't been too bad
Trying to
My laptop is being slow so she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s waiting on me
pretend your laptop died but in reality it is you who died (of sleep, not of die)
Kill this thing it keeps doing this
Once I was 45 min late
Cuz this bitch wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t load
I can't
It didn't stop snowing until may man
you might be disappointed at cwru
I used to be like you *sigh*
That sounds like it would hurt
are we not already encapsulated water above room temperature?
we just need a metal shell
Leaving Hawaii today üò≠
just got home from work

that's early
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work again until thursday
i work 4-7 pm on thursday, 7-3 on friday, 6-2 on saturday
***that's vewwy early***
damn
because today i was technically still training even though i was on my own
then get the gross one i guess
Oh goodness what the hail
and i want to glow
i didnt
i was like,,, bro they could be diabetic you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
@Deleted User i need a pint suggestion, any ideas?
Feels like 92 out
God I hate the sun
why would you ever go outside
Sorry I was going to finish that ice cream and go on a long walk
if you get a coolatta i hate you
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like a slushy except they only come in vanilla, blue raspberry, and strawberry
we use like this terribly sticky syrup and i hate it
i bet that syrup has a bunch of bad chemicals
they used to have a lot more flavors but now dunkin is phasing out kiddie cups and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s becoming more of a grown brand i feel
i think everyone should work at a fast food/fast casual restaurant at least once in their lives to realize how messed up america's food is
eh i guess that could work
they are appealing to gen z i guess
at least you don't work at starbucks
like a man yelled at us because we ran out of decaf hot coffee and we were brewing other things so we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it
like what are we supposed to do sir
a customer straight up told me we should fire our manager cuz we keep running out of cinnamon crunch bagels even tho we make 120 a day instead of the recommended 90 by corporate
like up to 2 weeks in advance
he yelled at my poor coworker
she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so nice too i felt bad
no we generally aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
we only have so much room though
today was so busy and our second register wouldn't WORK
damn
but ofc it wasn't working
and guess what! if there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a problem with your order, the person who hands you your food or tells you usually isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the one responsible!!
half the time there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even just one person making your coffee
some customers simply don't understand what it's like to work at a restaurant
this lady lost her drivers license
they also need to do this so they can have some empathy for those that do like please
obviously the manager is supposed to check
we were getting crushed in drive thru
panera has drive thru?
and this woman got angry and said she couldn't stay longer
and when we said our manager is super busy in drive thru she was like well im a customer too
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a subway that has drive thru in my town lmaoo
imagine drive thru subway
the panera i work at has the fastest drive thru in the nation
except i don't work drive thru
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work drive thru either lmao
it seems so stressful
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m new and haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten comfy using the POS yet
i feel like my manager will only have me run bakery since im only here for the summer
i probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ever because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m leaving in a month and a half
our drive thru is very slow lately
oh rip
oh same
frosted donuts without sprinkles. i hate them.
pri u work at panera??
panera has better bagels than most fast food places i feel like
i only had cinnamon crunch and choc chip tho
so you CANT steal the recipe off the wall
damn
yeah i don't have that :((((
doesn't it come in like prepacked hockey disks
u could probably find a copycat recipe online
uhhh idk if i can like openly talk about how we make our food (stupid corporate rules)
even if i did eat eggs/meat/cheese i would NEVER get a breakfast sandwich from dunkin i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s such a boring secret
ik but i don't wanna get in "trouble"
my sister used to work there
i won't say anything specific but i highly suggest avoiding panera's soups
i ate there once in 2014 that's it
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re frozen, aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they?
nothing is real here
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just exposing dunkin left and right lmao
US milk do be kinda bad tho with all the mistreatment of cows
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like the milk that the person brings to our home every day and pours into our pan (it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a thing in my mom√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s city)
Ikr I feel so guilty when I drink milk here
Oh wow, I did not know that milk is delivered everyday in India. Almost nobody in the USA still gets deliveries specifically for milk although it used to be very common like 50 years ago
oh
I don't think I've eaten there much before
I bet it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen all over India but at least where my mom lives it happens. I bet it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen all over her city. Literally one of the house members will stand outside in the evening with a pan and someone will come and pour some milk into it
Olive garden tastes so bad
never been
Had it once and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember how it tastes
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had olive garden since my sister stopped working there
I haven't had Olive garden in years omg...
I've been craving it soooooo bad
I miss the rage
without angry people we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have fun stories
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m surprised this isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the case in US
is this a widespread thing why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t i get to do this :(
omg i just realized something
she was so wrong for that omg
and then we spent like 3 months on the phantom of the opera
In reality I'm 5'4 stand on my money now I'm 6'6 üò≠üò≠
In reality I'm 6'1 and when i stand on my money I'm 5'3
In the US, milk is sold in containers like gallons (128 fl oz) and it can be good for weeks
here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an infographic type thing i made for the phantom of the opera and it screams of 16 year old with no brain. i am, however, not wrong
2 weeks is generous
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what I consume in this country anymore
Even the water aint right here üò≠üò≠
nothing is right
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even trust my vegetables
But are v bad
they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taste pretty
All food in America sucks
I think the farmers markets aren't bad in America tho
Most people here don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to farmers markets
the raspberries in the grocery store are nothing compared to the ones i grow in my backyard
Whereas tap water in America is so much worse
I miss india
I will die on the hill that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather eat food in India than in America
plus ohio has like 3 indian restaurants, can't get any good food here
The converse is that the water doesn't provide any benefits for you teeth, so malnutrition and decay are both more likely
I found an article from the The Lancet saying that air pollution alone killed 1.7 million Indians in 2019
Water isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the only thing that keeps your teeth healthy. Are you tryna say indians don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take care of their teeth?
... added fluoride improves oral health measurably compared to unfluorinated water. That water doesn't have fluoride in it if what you're saying is true.
idk if indians have fluoride in their water lol
cuz i stopped drinking tap water lol
Idk about filtered
i heard tap water is bad for you tho
idk
stupid microplastics
we consume basically one credit card a week
Goddamn wtf
do the math for a year
i probably don't consume as much as i eat more homecooked food than the average american
american veggies be bad
we could lol but unfortunately there's just a lot of people to provide food for
so they cut corners
and are slowly killing us all while tryna feed us
we did last year too
Bigger companies offer more and cheaper produce and most Americans don't have the money or time to go to local shops thats the problem, I think the big corporations have too much power
i wish healthier (REAL, the bar is that low) food would be more accessible
i think maybe because my mom's city is small, their water isn't as heavily polluted
even tho her state is orange
This is specifically for air pollution but there's probably a connection between water and air pollution
Oh
scientists are still trying to figure that out but i've read how microplastics can leach out dangerous chemicals into our bloodstream
they don't know if it's negative
super wild guess
I found a study saying that sardines have by far the highest plastic content measured in the study which looked at squid, prawns, oysters, crabs, sardines, etc. I eat those several times a week :cursed_flushed:
That's scary
but they're slowly starting to detect microplastics in our water
and i can bet they will eventually be able to conclude that this has a negative impact on our health
If it is determined that it's bad, then what can we do about it?
nothing
i ain't no doctor but that's what i would do
Bottled filtered water is the source of the microplastics in the tap water though
my point still stands
I can't believe yall are still talking about this üò≠
even if i didn't have anxiety
idk about y'all
but taplin refill sucked imo
it tasted bad
The fountain on the ground floor sucks
and i tried stj filer today
g o o d :Culture:
Oh
it tasted like
idk what's it called in english
norddddd

ateveryone ksl 2nd floor filer bad
I haven't been in ~~sackstroker~~ Strosacker since freshman year

I'm still grasping the fact I need to fix my sleep schedule when the semester starts. I've come to the realization my schedule is not sustainable
8 hours is optimal though
Dude they were soooo mad üò≠üò≠üò≠ but I used to draw a lil house with flowers and he gave me an A
Basic shit üíÄüíÄ

No walmart shit cuts ut

I want Italian food
Makes me miss the homeland
Summaqs fucking disgusting imo

most of the ones sold are bleh
I always wanted to try a lot of Italian food but yall put pork in so much shit dude üò≠
i'm just trying to have that human-to-human interaction with zach üò≠
chat died again :sadweasel:
No, I was supposed to go December of 2020 but Rona
But then my dad got a giant abcess following a lap Chole and ended up having to use all of our vacation money on medical bills because he was in the hospital for about a month
Oofff, hope hes feeling better.
I will die on this hill, and American healthcare will still bill me for dying on said hill
Although there's the awkward moment where I speak very very little italian and instead became fluent in german
And I'm now a Senior in college
I didnt know that
It's even more remarkable in Germany's case because they had to reincorporate East Germany into its economy following the Cold War
LMFAO I didnt know this either üò≠üò≠
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s weird how it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get spoiled
Milk that you bought two weeks ago is usually okay but my experience is that it's bad in week 3
And the reason why milk is pasteurized because Americans like to drink it cold. Back in the day americans would drink cold, unpasteurized milk which made them sick because they would ingest the bacteria too. This wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really an issue for Indians (and still isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t) because they boiled their milk before drinking it (you already know that) which kills bacteria lol. I think packaged milk in India today is also pasteurized but I have no clue. Probably is
one of the last things i said was √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwell for potatoes you have to start them in cold water√¢‚Ç¨
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink polluted water if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what you were asking
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t asking that lol ofc I know you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink polluted water
the water in foreign countries is terrible most of the time
*there are places around campus u can get condoms n shit if you need it tho*
I promptly ate the food

i hope someone orders an iced latte at dunkin on thursday because i want to make an iced latte
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared to do that because idk if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m allowed to
and i never make myself large drinks
Where I work we can eat whatever we want as long as the manager is okay with it
and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared of being too expensive yknow
Since I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work the line
my manager has to ask me if i want anything to eat before i will eat because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared of asking
if she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell me i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go
i make myself a drink when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s slow
right around like 3-5 no one comes in and we just stand around and talk about how there could be a dead body in the ceiling
vs just standing around trying to find something to do yknow
my shift on thursday is going to be so boring
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it, you might get cut
I keep getting calls saying my car warranty expired
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even drive
my back hurts
I just woke up and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still tired bc I was watching anime past 1am last night üò©

The weather widget on Windows 10 broke for me so now I just get an invisible button üòÇ

Shit nvm now he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in my toilet
i didn't have to download that app for a while :0
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to use duo until i signed up for duo
I had to sign up for duo for some university of Miami shit during application hell like six months ago and everything else duo related had just been automatically signing me in

y tho
still sad from breakup :')
cat hugs very much appreciated
nah, just happened last week
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry :(
the worst days are over tho
now it's just trailing bad vibes
tho now I'm just kinda contemplating cutting all connections with her for long enough for me to get over her
bc at the moment I'm still pretty attached and we still chat a fair bit
Yeah I would try to cut back on chatting with her
If any of you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had them taken out yet wisdom tooth surgery is pretty chill
idk what I was afraid of
What are you talking about? I was sore and swollen for like three four days and I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat properly and shit
I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even spit cuz I would dislodge a blood clot
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a little sore and swollen but I can still eat jello and stuff
And don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look in a mirrorüò≠
Istg I was so scared the swelling wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go down
That reminds me that I need to make a LinkedIn
A few hours ago
Also when do I get feeling back in my chin?
Never
You have lost that privilege
In a few hours
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll feel PAIN
Well I swore I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that loopy
When you wanna clean out your mouth, just waterfall
All I did was keep saying I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that loopy
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even use the painkillers ü§§
Push through the pain :NM_PeepoCryDrink:
serious respect for you Alex
Just in case I need for bad shit
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even take them properly
I forgot to take them sometimes
We still have July!
Cuz my small brain can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t handle memories
Tbh it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even hurt that much
After the general numbing thing they gave me during the surgery I felt a lot of pain but it was manageable
I feel like the general anesthesia is overboard for wisdom teeth
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m extremely anxious though
i want to be asleep
But then again I just have bad memory in general so
i think they forgot about me
i am so tired
I feel like sleeping and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at work rnü•≤
My surgeon told me to eat soft food for 2 weeks
ah right that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad
after the surgery is the fun part I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop crying and talking about Chick-fil-A :cursed_flushed:
I have two top wisdom teeth and idk when to get them out
I got general anesthesia and didn't say anything after I woke up
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know why smh
bc I would have had to take out 8 teeth if I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take out those four
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t heard of anyone here who removes them
It was going towards my other teeth and would have been bad
My dentist took them out bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fucked up
Also humans have evolved to no longer require wisdom teeth since over time our jaws became smaller, so there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no room to keep our wisdom teeth. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why we need to get them removed
Weird how I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never heard of anyone remove their wisdom tooth here
My dentist showed me an X-ray of my teeth and it looked bad
@sprinkles2108 is about to say Indians don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have wisdom tooth. I can feel it coming
Damn raunak you beat me right to itüò©üò©
My teeth are far apart from each other so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really get cavities
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get cavities
I only got one tiny one as a kid that I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even need anesthesia for
mine aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad but i still have to get them out
Never had braces gang rise up
My sister has had braces for so long because her teeth were so bad
She still has braces
Idk why it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not good either
My guess is between $3-5k
also how long did it take for you guys to get feeling back in your lower lip?
Dental insurance is bad and doesn't cover much
The thing that scared me most about wisdom teeth removal is that in rare cases, permanent nerve damage occurs
Yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m worried about
apparently it takes a while for my lips to get feeling back
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that loopy but I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really feel anything
go to sleep raunak
I have to wake up in 2 hours tho ü•≤
Lemme guess. Temple or somethin?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to wear a retainer but I stopped after a year and a half even tho I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t supposed to stop completely. And my teeth still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t moved
I heard you have to wear your retainers full-time for a few months after your treatment completes
Idk I need braces or anything
Most people get it for cosmetic purposes but some (like my sister) need them for medical reasons
Cause mine aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t misaligned, the top front 4 have on both sides have gaps
It definitely requires a lot of diligence. This is not the type of thing where you'll want to forgo it for more than 2 days. If I didn't wear retainers for 2 days, it would feel painfully tight if I put it back on
my sister had an expander and braces and i had nothing. she also has worse vision, burns badly, has hundreds of allergies, and has straight hair while i have curly. in other words, i won the genetic lottery.
I always make fun of my sister for having been born with awful teeth
no my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s teeth were so bad
absolutely terrible
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember someone making fun of my teeth tho
I have awful teeth lol
Except Anjali
My sister was probably worse
those are her baby teeth and if only looks bad because she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s missing one
i need to find a picture of her at like 12
I miss my baby teeth. They looked better
Oh Oop
Yep! I rip em right out
I might as well not go to sleep now. I have to wake in 1.5 hours
Rip
but rn it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bother me that much
@raunakwastaken can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t resist est
Keeps calling me back
Reactions tho
oh
You would need nitro to use your server√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s emotes elsewhere though

I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still waiting be for this server to be renamed casecord √¢‚Ç¨Àú25√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

i can but i would *never*
Not good lol. 
Didn't get too many matches.
Didn't like it after the first week
That's why I stuck with bumble which I downloaded at the same time lol ü§£
Bumble went much better. But in the end didn't really work. 

And then connected with someone from school and that lasted for 6 months.
Haven't used a dating app since
how will you ever find someone now?!
how did it end lmfao, you slid out?
BAHAHA im sorr im sorry
Meeting organically lol. What a concept. Can't imagine.
You should just find someone on discord or something. Much easier
the almost girlfriend got to the point of her asking me and i said no because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not dating someone across the atlantic ocean
the almost boyfriend i caught before it got that far and i pushed him away (though that one was more feasible as he only lived 125 miles away vs 3000)
the funniest part is that i actually hate british accents
i have a work crush but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just going to ride it out because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m quitting in a month and a half
well idk, i dont think we'll date
i stopped liking people in my hometown in about april
because i knew i was leaving
you literally have a work crush
idk where he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s from
extremely close
dont date him
but you want him to beüòè
no i actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I wish I knew someone named a achary
Be wrong
i never met a daniel in high school until my public speaking class
i once had a dream that he died and it was so sad
I know someone named Soren
oh really?
Idk how long I'll keep it
Bro @toomanyzs u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a zachyard friend
respect for starting the count at 0 like real fucking chads
idk who i would be
ouch
I know but they could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve started at ZZ2 and they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t because they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re chadly and they get woman
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get women üò©:PensiveWater:
what about annabelle for women which is what @jellieellie keeps calling me in moments of rage
Declan is pretty bad

your dog is called √¢‚Ç¨≈ìKiwi and bruno√¢‚Ç¨ ?
Oop sorry

I'm too tired for this
I just ate a pound of hamburgers
Having a kid named Leland would be awful
Megan is the only correct spelling of that name everyone else is spelling it wrong
there are like 80 ways to spell kaylee and for that reason i HATE that name
I have a classmate named Kieron and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the most annoying little shit
i will die for megan fox
polygamy exists, and we aren't dating
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m worried about all of the people in this thread
he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a bad looking dude
He isn't good looking
he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s classically attractive he just looks like a huge tool and he probably doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take showers
still white
while most men are subpar i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
there is a specific archetype that is classically attractive and yes white is part of that if ur the fuckin media but he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also got the bone structure of a classically attractive man sorry the fuck bout it
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter anyway bc I find him very unappealing
Im literally not dog
I don't know any other actors than that
I never said classically handsome makes u hot automatically bro
Im saying society would find him attractive but personally I am REPULSED by mgk
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think sebastian stan is attractive
classically handsome means he would be on the cover of magazines that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean everyone personally has to be attracted to him
His eyes are too far apart
conventionally he is but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like conventionality
annie idk what youre on about
I played it until last year
tired: pron
wired: curvy buildings
inspired: hagfish slime
Not everyone, but most people. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why the media, whose main motive is money, saw fit to put them in the public eye
kristen bell in Veronica Mars is my kryptonite I simp so hard
Forgot how to change it lemme see

Stay mad haters üòÇ the deep state can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop me!!!!
This guy inspired my look but unfortunately he dead
What happened
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a hollow earth, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been disproven already üôÑ√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ the death is a flat disc covered by a glass dome surrounded by a bi-pyramidal spacetime complex
I cannot envision you without a goatee, I need a clean version of the picture
idk why i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so wild today
bro but we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s down there!!!
Godzilla v Kong is not real life üòî stay mad @.bugcatcapoo
I think just because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so used to the goatee edit I am so thoroughly uncomfortable with the clean photo
There are some hardcore evangelical cousins of mine in North Carolina and I have no idea how they voted last year. I low-key wanna ask them
No need. :YEEHAW:

I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t either lol
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what game the Red Sox played until you said it
woah what did I miss there's so many baby pictures
at my school september 2, 2002 - september 1, 2003 is my year
Damn. üòî
Oh nvm
imagine having class rank
someone had it freshman year, someone else had it sophomore year, and i had it junior and senior year
this post made by private school that had a kid kill themself over class rank gang
damn
I would have been like 50something, I didn't really give a shit about my grades and my personal projects are probably the only thing that got me into case lol
yes it does except i wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t considered to be smart until like 4th grade so idk what happened with that
bro our school has class rank and they straight up just lie to us and say they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I think our school might do the same, but GPA is also calculated really weird
i wish i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to worry about class rank in high school lmao
The valedictorian at my school took extra classes either in the summer or after school to try hard for that #1 spot
I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been low as shit class rank I never got above a 3.65 in a school full of ppl who take only APs
Like literally fuck off lol
2 went to Dartmouth
my school weighs APs as honors which is fine bc colleges recalculate it. but they also DONT INDICATE A+ which this year was like a HALD POINT GPA DIFF FOR ME I was pressed
I think the real reason my school didn't have class rank is because GPA is unweighted so technically taking APs (assuming you're not a fucking genius) would lower your rank
I was in a massive school
damn ur brain is legit big then
my hs has a college readiness index of 11 on usnews
my school started with over 750 students freshman year for co 2021 and eventually went down to like 680 by graduation
my school just cranked out "college ready"
my school will fucking yell at you if you take a gap year it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s insanity
growing up in a silicon valley public school is like living inside of a trash compactor
I literally started crying because I told my college counselor I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going to apply to any UCs and she verbally abused me
yeah you were allowed like 7 sick days at my school before they started to think about making you retake classes
probably less than 75 people in my class are going to a 4 year college in the fall
my school has 5
they're literally trying to crank out college students
my school has 3 for a total of ~700 students
How bad of a school did you go to Hannah jeez
at the beginning of every year they broadcast to the entire school which students got into which colleges
1/3 of students went to a 4 year and 1/3 to a community
they publicly show the whole school which colleges rejected you
awful
:wtf:
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so awful why the fucj
yeah that doesn't sound legal
If you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sign any non-disclosure agreement I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not illegal
my hs doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have a single college counselor
so many ppl from my school got into like Cal and UCLA
I don't have any college counselors
we have guidance counselors but they know nothing about college admissions
yeah i only have guidance counsellors at my school not college counselors
dude doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the fucking entire college system literally make u sign a form saying u waive ur right to ownership over your application and acceptance results
most of the college application advice i got came from two Brown students that graduated from my high school
i think they tell the schools but tbh idk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if the college has to or not but they make the students tell them
at my school
Two of my teachers who wrote my letters of rec literally asked me to write them lol. My whole thing in HS was the administration absolutely despised me because I called them out on their bullshit frequently and in public, and the teachers all loved me because I showed genuine interest in their classes. I wish I could go back and try harder but I'm going to CWRU so no regrets
make you feel like an idiot or ungrateful because you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t report your acceptance to college counselors
My English teacher loved me just absolutely doing nothing in his class for 2 years and got straight A+s
this is the teacher who was always nagging me about how I √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t paying attention in class√¢‚Ç¨ because she thought I was doodling when I was taking notes
and then I had her write my rec letter because I fucking OWN her
my calc teacher senior year would yell at me because i was designing circuit boards in his class
My history teacher literally kicked me out one day bc I was on my computer after I finished his work ü•¥
And I WILLINGLY went to his class for 2 years
i kind of wish i could go back and apply to a different school early and also send my sat score to ivies but we cannot change the past and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m happy with case
I hate this teacher bc she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the sort of person who treats all students like 4 year olds
either she coddles you and condescends you OR she yells at you like you just stuck a pencil up your nose
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still salty that my first choice picked a kid with like a 3.4 weighted GPA and skips every class he can over me
she acts like we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never heard of an organ before
omg my sat score was so good for my high school why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t i SEND IT to ivies
Bro what is all this computer use in school
someone from my school got into brown with an sat score 60 or 80 points below mine
My bio teacher had a complete breakdown infront of us one day and since then she just did not give a fuck anymore
But I wasn't allowed to use my phone in high school or else i got a saturday school
and very average ECs, worse class rank, and worse GPA
UF picked kids that took easier classes and had worse grades than me over me ü•¥
I got rejected from a state school here in cali :KEKW:
which was supposed to be a safety
wasnt a uc
ur all bad schools
case is a bad school
college = bad
earth is a bad school
ur mom is a bad school
away
and yeah sorry @legendsexile specific school offers are against the rules but I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give you a warning bc I kind of goaded you into it
oh oki wont happen again :peepoHoldHeart:
Wow its really bad
shut the fuck up it slaps
"Took my big shit and my toilet had a clog"

there are like 465 people in my math lecture
nothing is ever as it seems
and never trust the admin
Lol I never expected much
why, do you want clarke?
Which class is it?

math 121
ufyufuugughg youtube upload is sooooo slow
I think the math class I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking is also pretty big though
Both my 122 and my Java class have a 250 student max√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
hoping to get credit for calc 1 honestly
i don't think i will lmao
i literally wrote "i ran out of calculator time :(" on one of my frq parts
Tbh I doubt there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s much of a difference in terms of quality between a 400 and 250 person class
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still a big ass class
i just don't want to take calc 1 again man
Calc is boring asf ü•≤
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
i just want more space in my schedule next semester
i dont know how i feel about calc
Chem is boring asf ü•≤
arent you a bio major
I took calc online so really I half assed the fuck out of it
So idk how I feel
i can't do bio lol
Chem is boring and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard as fuck
i think i'm doing biochem cuz its more useful than just bio
Never taking a Chem class again I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a comp sci major ü§§
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just mathü•≤
some of us like math
i'd say i prefer pure math most of the time because word problems have too. much. reading.
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the personality to like math
I will admit, math is raw when you know wtf ur doing
math feels good
I feel like a god
Yes, the opposite has happened to me and I feel the exact opposite üò≠üò≠
but i do like math
if you hate math, you are bad at math
I got a 5 in ap Calc and I hate math
I self studied bc and I hate math :NM_PeepoCryDrink:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on my phone at work this is fine
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m majoring in comp sci and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never taken a comp sci class in my life
It shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be too bad but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s funny

Not fair

Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t compare me to trump
I actually read the aot mango all the way til the end and I hated it so much I stopped watching the show
i caught up with it and they stopped releasing for months so i just forgot about it :LAUGHING:
mm i won't say i hate it
BUT I HATE EREN
I think ur supposed to hate Eren and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s supposed to make him a deep character or something but I just think he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s aggravating ü•≤
:wtf:
I HAVEN'T READ THE WHOLE THING
I hate ppl who spoil
ok ok i wont say anything
Some ppl did genuinely like the ending through so don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let us ruin it for you
In the penultimate chapter, Mikasa, Armin, Levi and the remaining Warriors battled Eren and the shining centipede that originated all Titans, formerly nestled in the Founding Titan's spine. After making it inside Eren's Titan mouth thanks to assistance from Levi, Mikasa decapitated Eren's human body and kissed him goodbye for the first and last time. The final chapter confirms that this killed him -- for good this time. As the dust settles, Mikasa brings his head to Armin, who tearfully mourns his loss with her. She then leaves the battlefield with it, knowing a proper burial won't be afforded to Eren after the devastation he caused via The Rumbling.
Wtf

This is not what Xi wanted
:yahuh: :wtf: :yahuh: :wtf: :yahuh: :wtf:
@alexthedawg Xi warned us against the external influence of our neighbors, so we must cast away manga in all its forms
It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t as bad as GoT
I saw Zhanda no!!! And scrolled super fast with my eyes closed
i know u think its funny zhanda but it really isnt
finn i'm sorry lol
i dont understand why u still do these things
and i think i would've had a hard time understanding the anime without reading the manga ahead of time
that being said, being spoiled still hurts :')
I've only been gone for like 10min
What happened
@speedbirdconcorde2 I want to see you in Anta and li ning apparel from now on

I think someone even put the whole movie on youchewb
Looks like a foreign language film that I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m bigoted
Like a lot of them are dumb and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t try too hard to be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìscary√¢‚Ç¨
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not really into horror movies because I simply don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find them interesting
wathcing conjuring alone is horrifying but watching it with friends is soooo hilarious
Oh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never done that
10 hours is a bit too much ngl
We haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen that one yet
you tried to exorcise me
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watched any of them
when you said that the cross won;t work cause the demon is muslin :LAUGHING:
Conjuring 3 was the worst conjuring ü•≤
i haven;t even watched 2 completely
i haven;t even watched "IT" yet
I liked IT pt 1 but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch pt 2
I heard it was bad
Or at least worse
doesnt matter. it was under the "horror" genre so it had to be rated 18+
I want to see conjuring 3
no one will go with me rip
If you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna go to theatres
I dont have hbo
Man I cannot remember the last time I went to a movie theater
my friend who would go with me cant watch horror movies without laughing hysterically so I'm not taking her
Except you get hbo for a month
Rip
I think the last time I went to a theater was like 3 weeks before the pandemic hit :cursed_flushed:
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even remember the last movie I saw in a theater
it is not on indian prime tho *sigh*
Thing is I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really use Amazon that much
Oh yeet
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what that show/movie is
My mom had Amazon prime for 2 months and then canceled it
cause my family's prime account is in india so it won't work in america
i mean prime video will work
but prime delivery wont
Oh
If there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one student subscription I want it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Spotify premium
i will miss indian netflix cause the american one is really bad
But idk if my parents would be on board with that
Is it cheaper though
Nothing
I use an iPhone is the difference
I have an iPhone too
I just dont want to remake my playlists for apple music tbh
idk why people spend $5-10 everyday on starbucks.
Because they have money
And don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to save
cold water >>>
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember the last time I drank something that was not water
rephrase: cold water but not with ice
We get it y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have iced water in IndiaüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
yea but i am guessing there are stores which offer cheaper coffee without a major drop in quality/taste
i heard cold water is not good for you
Shit I do drink tea though
Not really into it anymore
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember the last time I drank tea
And worse in quality
If I drank coffe I would never self brew
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just tired of coffee
Went back to my roots
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve heard it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s drying for your stomach (if the stomach is  empty) and bad for your teeth
Yeah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a problem with either coffee or tea but water is just the most readily available and cheapest
why does serena williams starts crying everytime she doesnt win
I thought she hurt her ankle
Dunno I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not a sports fan üò¢

I would feel so bad when my dad would buy them

I hope I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end up quitting tennis
I wish I could play it as often as I used to
im really bad i feel the need to apologize in advance
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t played in weeks
I hate myself

i havent played in over 4 :cursed_flushed:
I havent played tennis since I was like 12 lmao

I did but I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been in contact with him in a while
Also I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have private lessons consistently throughout my career so I switched coaches a few times
Also I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need a coach now lol I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not competing
some tricky passages at the end though
nothing you can't handle
Nope, now it's rhapsody no 6\
I wish I was a dog motherfuckers can straight up fall asleep in 30 seconds because their brains are already most of the way asleep at all times
I wish I was unable to experience complex thought and instead was motivated by getting pets and sleeping in the sun and chase ball and eat socks
I wish I was a dog so I could be neutered by my owner
So I can run naked without my balls hitting each other
there is nothing more unapologetically funny than my hs dean√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s instagram posts. comedic gold and he isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even trying.

Mini heart attacks everytime I ate or something
I think on My third day, My face so swollen and I got this bad taste in my mouth
I think every other wisdom hole is fine except that one, since that wisdom tooth was the farthest out
And internet said that was infectionüòÉ
Somehow my face isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t swollen
I drank a ton of pineapple juice though
But then when I went to the orthodontist last week, she said they healed beautifully
So I guess I was paranoid idk
Idk

whats wrong with the chinese one
in hong kong, 4/5 of those who died post vaccination took the chinese one
so it looks like if you have underlying conditions, the chinese one isn't as safe
this doesnt mean anything unless u say what percent of people took that vaccine to begin with
its an effective vaccine though it doesn't use mRNA
well no i mean if youre saying 4/5 of people who died after being vaccinated took that vaccine, then u always have to say what percent of people who got vaccinated to begin with took that vaccine
and case ain't taking any chances i guess
i personally think not enough people have died to know for sure what caused them to die, and that this disparity is mainly political
but what stands is that the vaccine developer isn't being transparent about their development process
Step one: Fuck around
Step two: Find out
they don't even offer it in the united states
antivaxers seem to be an exclusively american experience
the people here who aren't vaccinated are mainly older folks who just aren't bothered to
It really is dawg idk why
just got out of work
I wish I got tips
i work at dunkin
If med school is too hard then I can just drop out and be a stripper or try to do something with a math degree idk
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be stuck behind a desk all day every day üò©
My math teacher in hs quit last year to work at Lockheed Martin so... never too late to change your mind
I offset the negative effects of sitting and typing at a computer for most of the day by doing several hours of intense cardio a week üòÇ

If you aren't fully vaccinated, you have to move in and quarantine for a week

JUST GET THE STUPID SHOT ALREADY IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SHOT U TAKE

you are about to die in cleveland
73-75 is normally when I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do a jacket and just a long sleeve and anything over that is just a regular t-shirt
70 is starting to be cold-ish
I just scraped half of my left knee off at universal üòÉüëçüèº
it is bc I can still wear a jacket :KEKW:
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dress for the weather though the fits do not stop
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to dress in my style for cold weather
so if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m real cold it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just sweats i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be honest
my fits are a hoodie and pants or a hoodie and shorts. Idk how to actually pick out clothes that would go together :cursed_flushed:

Wish I could write
i thought mine were good but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into a single school that i had supps for lmao
I did the supp for case since I got deferred and it was definitely mediocre I did it the night it was due :KEKW:
~~and got waitlisted at the one i thought my supps were the worst for~~
but those were actually really bad
if you got deferred from early action you had the choice to do a supplemental
If anyone needs to buy a box fan for cheap. Lots of Lasko fans for even cheaper deals

If you guys didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ bc of the chicken wing shortage, wingstop rebranded their name to thigh stop
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been hearing about it for a few weeks
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why their prices have gone up recently I guess
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat much meat in the first place
But I wanna cut down even more
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had wings in a while
Bad weather in the Midwest a couple weeks ago

Limited staffing available in all parts of the supply chain

High demand during March madness and with stimulus checks

Perfect storm for short supply of chicken wings everywhere.
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no way they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re rebranding into thigh stop
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what wing stop is so
Wtf is THIGH stop
The fuck
No shitüò≠
Blame me for you are jealous I took all the wings
I went vegetarian for 6 hours once
There was this summer where I had to spend 3 days at a bhuddist temple and for the 3 whole days I only ate twice
I couldnt go long without meat
Oh I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that
I can feel a literal difference when I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had meat in so long. Like I feel so much better
Maybe, but I personally don't think I could switch. I would be too tempted
I could explain it well but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna lol
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had my ma√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cooking in 2 and a half years and the end of this year makes the 3rd so

Juju went from hero to villain in the 2020 season üò≠üò≠

Except for the cowboys because they're bad and obnoxious
Or patriots because God fuck the Patriots
They fucking ruined Josh gordons career over it
Too late he got suspended too many times üò≠üò≠üò≠
And they haven't reinstated him yet I believe

Damn the basketball team
Fuck the patriots and fuck brady
Dk Metcalf is a beast but hes got a bad mentality
He got lasik surgery after that season

I am not trying to come off as a pro-CCP supporter, but I just wanted to clarify the issue of the democratic movement in HK
The Democratic movement in Hong Kong is absolute trash even though I support their core tenet that the CCP is bad
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just terrible
Yes, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m anti-fascism but I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go anywhere near antifa
does antifa even really exist though
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a matter of scale cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not setting people on fire for supporting China (this actually happened)
Their idea of patriotism isn't real but I see what u mean
It's a shame that people of HK, on either side, who are all of the same culture and background, have been divided on such a trivial issue and resorted to using violence
I will now turn the microphone over to our ground correspondent, @samrobot, who has been covering HK since the beginning of the democracy movement
Damn how did this become so political
Nothing wrong with politics, good to discuss right? üíØ
So fucking corrupt dude
I want
I want money
I want chipotle
Sorry, I was only replying to Jarvis's message to clarify a few things about HK that I feel are often misunderstood or completely omitted in the context of reintegration
Cause why not
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just sad people with the same roots are choking each other
There are so many things I want \
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have existential crises üòÇ
Just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think about it!!
In fact I wrote my whole college essay on having an existential crisis ever since I was 5 ü•≤
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like living
To be fair I used to stress a lot over existential stuff, like how nothing means anything and how I (and everyone else) don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really matter. But at some point it became kinda nice to realize that nothing I do is ever gonna be that important in relation to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe grand scheme of things.√¢‚Ç¨ Like every stupid thing I say or do will just fade into nothing.
Maybe my parents just raised me wrong or sumn :naenae:
we may be indescribably small in comparison to the universe, but you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never run out of things to do here on earth
Rip
I really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the emptiness in living a normal life
There isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t any
Do what you want, find someone, live happily
You find it
Seriously what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the point of thinking about the vastness of the universe if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re never gonna even make it to space
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not fucking Jeff Bezos
The way I see it, the ultimate goal of a person√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s life is to find their purpose, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I said life is cruel because if some people are lucky, they find their purpose earlier than others but then they live the rest of their lives just like that. For the people that don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, they spend a good amount of their life looking for that purpose but when the find it, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re half way in the grave already
Why give life when death exists
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe in √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpurpose√¢‚Ç¨ üòÇ
You should revise your definition of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìfinding purpose√¢‚Ç¨ cuz you seem to imply that your √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpurpose√¢‚Ç¨ is predestined. To me, we √¢‚Ç¨≈ìstumble√¢‚Ç¨ upon our purpose and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s up to us if we want to accept what we have
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really believe in purpose
But that has nothing to do with being alive
having a purpose is capitalist propaganda, making you think you have to be "successful" and "hard working" :p
havent you seen the crop circles!
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that you need to be successful üò≥
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a simple man I simply wish to live by a beach and fish all day
*i cant believe someone animated that lmaooo*
Oh fuck the rules man America has torn up the constitution and is wiping her nasty ass with it
and i want her to have more experience
Really needs to be studied
Its just fucking paper
too bad, he's that famous actor from home alone 2:P
Idk how anyone can seriously believe that the constitution is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìperfect√¢‚Ç¨
opus die
Bad word choice üò≠
Cuz rn it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unequivocally the trumpies who are disrespecting the constitution
To be fair Jesus in Revelations is metal as fuck
Doing the ~~lords~~ Allah√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s work
Zhanda that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called a death threat
You know hypocrisy on its own is bad enough but when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s from religious people it makes me want to commit unlive
Dawg im laughing too hard at this

I mean it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really hurt
Yeah please don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be aggressive
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t

Woman didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take no for an answer

Honestly sometimes the shit they recommend is just wrong
Such a boring class
And I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m studying Englishüò≠
They told me to take chorus, and there's nothing wrong with it but I had no prior experience with music, they were talking about sopranos and I was thinking of the show
Nope

I forgot to take pain meds this morning since they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hurt at all then

it's a store where everything is $5 or below (except that's a lie)
Dw I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll frequently go outside University Circle late at night
Bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be dead üòÇ
I feel like the area outside University Circle is pretty bad
Just do what u can do to protect urself and like I said take necessary precautions accordingly, im not really familiar with the area tho tbh
That one actually just got solved tho
I have an inside scoopy
What happened in that case?
Case PD used a cell phone found in another robbery case on campus and tracked the gps data to the locations of 20 other robberies in the greater Cleveland area
See what I'm not getting, what are they gonna get from a student? A credit card? What if the student has an android and isn't even carrying cash? Doesn't seem like worth 4 ppl
a lot of people here wear canada goose n shit
Bruh so they would strip you n shit? üò≠ '
They might strip you but idk about shitting
idk, but if I was gonna rob someone you can bet your ass it would be someone wearing canada goose and airpods... so like a good bit of the student body
I haven't seen anyone wearing Canada Goose on-campus
Damn bro my grandma got me a nice bag as a graduation gift ig i ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bringing that to campus
sorry for your loss
Fortunately my parents moved us away so I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t grow up there
I wish that we could lease this crowd
I think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just gonna bring a decoy wallet with me at all times so if someone tries to rob me i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just flash them the wallet and throw it away and high tail tf outta there
This is a fate worse than death

I got the prince as a gift and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna open that book
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like reading about old political theory
If you want my honest opinion√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ most political theory is just old white guys talking about politics in a world that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist anymore
In my experience  I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never read anything from old political theory that is useful in my day to day ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏

This convo is not what I expected to get when I stopped lurking
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong with me?!??
And some sophomore keeps tagging me and cursing me out then deleting his messages lmao
Maybe I don't have balls ü§î

I actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean to offend you but yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not Christian
I'm not shamanist I was just fucking around

I talk about that show too much but im asking cuz the characters are catholic üò≠
I haven't, why?
Mafia Boss and his personal life, he keeps getting panic attacks and thus has to see a psychiatrist, but ofc this is a big no in the mafia

Breaking bad is good @alexthedawg
And game of thrones but I cant get over s8
Fuck them man they ruined it
Such a fucking shame

No cuz they forreal fumbled the bag so hard with the last season
Dumb as fuck you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss much
I lost ALL interest lol
Dude forreal. I dont blame u. And the author taking too fucking long too
Zhanda wtf happened to celibacy
Fuck
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve thought about grrm and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve accepted that he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually want to finish the books series. Like if he actually wanted to finish it, he would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done so already. But he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already made so much $$$$ and he literally doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gaf about it. And if the author doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even care then I guess I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really care because anything he releases for a song of ice and fire will just be some half-assed half-baked shit that won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even be any good
Also it was kinda boring anyway
It really did
I guess
Most shows aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t as good as ppl seem to think they are
I guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not much of a tv guy
Idk tbh
I like shows over movies, because I don't have the patience to sit for 3 hrs
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sopranos like 50 hrs or smth??
I feel like movies are rushed
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken that test too
Took too long ü•≤
I haven't taken it in forever so idk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like labels or categories bc they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re unnecessarily restrictive
I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t judge but definitely don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t share if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to
not really
The prison industrial complex isn't a fucking joke alex
It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really about that though
It was about a lawyer who defended death row inmates
Damn my results have moved a decent bit since a few years back
You took the whole ass test :PensivePoop:
Most I can answer without thinking too much
That one has a long and short version
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so many variants to the pct that I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep track of it all
FUCK YEAH :TRUMPED:
Never speak to me again
Sigh
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate on you too much bc I used to be conservative ü•≤
So fucking racist
U dont like commies?

If you must not say then I respect your wishes üòî
I didn't need to see john cena ripping a hole through my phone
Sad
Sad or Happy
I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really care either way. Idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too optimistic of a viewpoint, but I feel that the vast majority of people genuinely believe that they want to make the world better so I try not to harshly judge most political ideologies  that ppl follow
Is someone named Sebastian Kennedy lurking on here
I respect that you don't assume people you disagree with have bad intentions
Can't find it

Idk i can't make that assumption maybe I just got unlucky üòî
My parents got it

I had to quarantine in my room from late December to early January, I went outside and was fascinated
Thats so fucking weird
It really is. My parents got sick around the time the capitol
Damn i didn't know all yall were up
And still I have problems with smell smh
No cuz variants and possibility of reinfenction
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they were both false. Cuz the day of my first test to see if I was positive. I got sick that day. Like right after and then was sick for three days most and then I was fine. My mom got sick first and then when two weeks later we got tested again. My dad tested positive so another two weeks quarantine. I think I contracted it and recovered within the first two weeks. My dad after two weeks unfortunately
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so bad in Bangladesh rn

My policy is to tell so many white lies that even I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep up with it

Bad morning Lamia
this is what waking up early feels like :PES_HmmSpecs:
yea
a lot of time has passed since i woke up
compared to usual
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s over a month left
oh
haven't u reserved the ticket?
rain go brrr
Right we can't have shit in cleveland
Cuz cleveland winters.. preposterous
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know are you white?
I also heard we need boots
Yeah that's an important consideration. For some things, I might just buy them online and have them delivered by Amazon to CWRU if I can't fit everything on a couple bags on an airplane. For example, I'm considering buying a fan for the first several hot weeks, but a lot of them are really big and heavy so I wouldn't be able to fit them well on an airplane bag
300 - 500 bucks im never getting back
goretex is the shit
yo working at dunkin really is it
i hate it but i made $27.26 in tips today
sick i already have that off from work because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting teeth pulled out of my face üòé
*go to class without masks because you turned in your cards*
i still wear my mask to work even though i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to
Idk
I need me a sugar daddy to buy me Spotify premium
My work just makes us wear masks regardless
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna verify each person
i said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìi can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe i know the woman who invented beauty√¢‚Ç¨ and she was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwell i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m her mom and i took those pics so..√¢‚Ç¨ SUSAN CAME FOR MY NECK
me too
hmu when u find one
don't we get student discount?
Off work ü•≤
i thought we still need to wear masks indoors
do you really think we'll make it to 80 tho
Doubtful. We went through a social nightmare last year
How would masks in the dorms work
we didn't have roommates last year
dunno about this year
Apparently I snore üò¥
No I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
If I have a roommate, and he happens to be a long-term snorer, I will sleep in the common room
i don't think girls typically snore?
so idk if that's a big issue for us
i don't snore
i could be very well wrong
Someone tell me to charge my phone I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at 5 %
Let it Die
charge your phone lamia
Fr y so many ppl still not vaccinated üòî
And still so many Americans are hesitant and refusing
I hate the guburnet
I honestly just think it's a way for people to feel control of their life. Cuz they say they dont trust it, then do crack on the weekends
Or eat hotdogs or consume a bunch of other unregulated shit
Doesn't make sense
One minute the FDA is bullshit next minute "the fda hasn't fully approved it" do you trust the FDA or not dawg üò≠üò≠
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter üòÇ I already took it
Theres countless things not fda approved that ppl consume like vitamins and all that stupid shit, but thats not a problem to them ofc
Americans just have a huge tendency to not trust government. And hate being told what to do. And it's good sometimes as the government can be wrong but other times like this they just shoot themselves in the foot.
that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do shit
me too omg
Cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m English
i went to an information session and hated it, got a bunch of emails, got deferred from a school and realized my list was horrible, applied to case because it had no essay, then got in and realized all of the amazing things about it
i feel more content and comfortable rn than i would if i were on my way to my dream school i think
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talk to many people in high school
i was also always tired
i am just glad i didnt peak in high school i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think
my parents really didn't mind me staying up til 4 am talking to some of my case friends cuz they knew i didn't have many friends growing up
man i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have friends the last couple years in high school because being in an unhealthy relationship made me an insufferable person to be around
and i ruined another friendship earlier on because i was insecure and terrible and couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t express my emotions but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve made things right with her
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize how bad it was until i was done with it
my physical and mental health declined severely and i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even realize until recently
Hs just wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t good for me
Staying up until 4 AM was one of my bad habits before. All it took was one night of going to sleep late and it would reverse progress I made for a week. Now I go to sleep at 12 AM everyday and wake up at 7 AM
I'm still in the 4 AM phase rn
i used to go to sleep at around 4am. now i wake up at this time
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise" - Benjamin Franklin
i usually sleep late and wake up late
Yea especially cuz of the morning classes. I need to break the habit üò≠
@kaori_flute you are somehow asleep and awake all the time
i agree with david
even tho i do sth else :LAUGHING:
My 9:30 AM Linear Algebra class (I was in Central Time as a remote student so 8:30 AM my time) class last semester saved my sleep schedule since I probably would have woken up at 10 AM or later if not for that class
ok y'all didn't see me
i am working
That makes sense. I had a class last semester at 9 am, and I feel like I had it under control, then 4th quarter i just started skipping and oversleeping
At 11? Damn
There was an up to 2 percent extra credit in this class for attending nearly every class so that really got me to wake up on time
Ahh I see, I didnt have that, I had to compensate by studying at 3 am üíÄ
And damn linear algebra as a freshman??
Isn't that for sophomores
It was also kinda tough, definitely a class that had me working all night on homework
There was a homework assignment with like two questions that I spent 3 hours on
Dude if I spent 3 hrs on two questions and got them both wrong I think I'd break something
@Deleted User isn't your name muhammed?
Dawg i never said that noüíÄ
oh my b
It's rare to get a question almost completely wrong, grading in upper-level math classes has a lot of partial credit and focuses on the steps of your proof and reasoning instead of the result of computation. Even on questions I didn't really understand, I got 80-90 percent partial credit
The two lowest test grades I've gotten at CWRU were MCQ exams in Calculus 2
y'all didn't have to solve the integral for polar area right?
iirc, you said that you didn;t have to
Reading this itself made my head hurts
things will be in person so you don;t have an option
nah u won't have MCQs
If you're doing engineering then you don't have a choice. If you're pre-med then you don't have to take his class
He won't do MCQs anymore I think, that was because of online classes
126 was ez money
Damn üò≠
head went blank mb
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deserve the credit I got for 122 but oh well
OK U DIDN'T SEE ME
that is why i want him
You got a 5 on Calc BC and you think you don't deserve it?
And it still counts towards an engineering degree?
I took the exam in 2020 in which majority of the exam was AB material. Literally only 4 parts covered BC content so
Nope
i wish
@kaori_flute bro sometimes i wish i would've taken the BA route
Computer Science
but i mean
we already suffered thru chem 111 and phys 121
I forgot most of calculus Oop
idk why i went for BS
mmm not atm anymore
Going vegetarian is a healthy choice though?
The tofu though
Rip the tofu
health went down :wobble:
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know why I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I literally find meat to be heavy on my stomach
don;t eat. ez
And I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat meat often
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if I could go vegan though
mm i prolly can't
Poor animals
Yea unfortunately
@kaori_flute don;t go nuuuuu
we;re all gonna die anyway. pls transfer all your money to me
Remember at the beginning of the pandemic ppl posted the skies and shit and were like "Earth is healing"? that did not last long
idk bro lol
oh
cuz lamia is more up with it with Bollywood
sigh
THIS AINT A COMPETITION
it is and you already lost
yo fuck you
HOLY CRAP
exactly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t compete with me
damn
We may be American but DAMN we have taste
I dont think Zarif is a name. I'm pretty sure it pairs with the phrase "tool". If im not mistaken zarif altool means something along the lines of "tall one" or person, something like that i forgot
@lamarcindale I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never seen a Bollywood playlist so similar to mine omg
i still dunno what is means :LAUGHING:
LMFAO I just looked it up and it says it means handsome length
how about don't blast any music on campus
cause then you would be a jerk
but basically
the song talks about asking the youth(i think) to not leave the country forever
bro wtf?
isn't that √ò¬∏√ò¬±√ô≈†√ô
i forgot arabic
shame
shame
@ambitiouslearner We will defend the motherland until the last drop of our blood

I can't even tell what animal that is
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re really social animals
we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had piggies since 2010
aww
gooey is just huge tho
My greyhound doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really care that much
Im thinking deep thoughts leave me alone
Humans do that too, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t judge
i had a dream that someone asked for a bagel toasted then frozen at dunkin and then they got mad at me when i told them we literally could not do that
Good god almighty I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so tired
either my oatmilk is bad or this smoked vanilla syrup is gross
either way my latte isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very good
sad day today
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still drinking it because if i get food poisoning i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get to go home early
She told me to do shit
And I never touched it
I didn't know you have guinea pigs
Bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve heard both
since i have no chem credits to transfer i'm just gonna register for chem 105 and math 121 on the 28th
fuck its the day i land in san francisco
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all, is waking up at 7 early?
Raunak you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re wrong as always
~~not me waking up at 10 am today though~~
Just wanted to confirm
I started school at 7:20 am
It was too early for me to focus
I would have club meetings as early as 6:30 am
Mine starts at 7:45 but still :cursed_flushed:
My middle school started at 7:40
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still asleep in class at 7:20 so
Middle school was a fever dream
I used to reach my hs early for some reason
30 minutes before school started
Never used it *for* school anyway
Still had a shit sleeping schedule
Did anyone else√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hs function on a college schedule
Yea it was early
Damn
We changed it up in my junior year to college schedules
Really doubting my hs choice rn
Back in middle school
Update tink is back to how it looked before the pandemic
I had 4 classes a day since ninth grade but they were rly long
NO CHANCE. I just joined the zoom link for the interview I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to have 2 minutes ago and it says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s starts at 1PM WHEN THE EMAIL SAID IT STARTS AT 1:40 AND THE MANAGER EVEN SAID 1:40
not 2 minutes late, just have been sitting here since it was supposed to start
20 mins and still nothing, might as well leave
honestly I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather start early than end late tho
Why were you in school for that long?
My high school ended at 2:45 p.m. and seniors had privileges, meaning they could leave about an hour earlier due to how the schedule was setup
We only had a period in the middle of the day, giving us a break from classes, but it was a designated work time tho lol
my hs started at 7:30 and ended at 1:45
i honestly dont even remember when we got out
or went in
this whole conversation reminded me that my cousin is starting high school in the fall üòÄ dhmu i literally held him when he was a baby
fair
Getting kinda worried about all the flight cancellations/delays recently
ah, yeah. they've been happening left and right as of late
bad weather
my sister is supposed to fly tomorrow uhhhh
Southwest also had an issue where they had to cancel all their flights for a day because of a computer error
I normally fly with Southwest so I'm getting worried about how many flights they're canceling
My flight home got cancelled and I had to take a layover one instead
my friend was stuck in NC a couple weeks ago for 2 days and his flight got delayed a second time and my man just carpooled with some random old man and drove 8 straight hours from NC to FL
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m literally never reading another murakami book again
Fucking doodoo
I have a layover in Vancouver in two weeks and if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on Canadian soil for over 24 hours they will force me to quarantine
Like it wanted to be smart but it was just dumb
truth hurts
rn i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m reading never let me go by kazuo ishiguro
Never heard of it tbh
no one wants to talk at 10am so i just read
Dawg idk y I laughed, fuck my humor is broken üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I wasn't expecting that üíÄ
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve talked to the same group of ppl in high school for so long that I have lost the ability to socialize with anyone who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t already know me
You're no longer in Pittsburgh?
No I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still in Hong Kong dawg
No one is awakeüòÇ
you scared me
Idk
go to sleep
Jesus fuck what the fuck
Last time I did this I got restricted on Twitter
wtf
Are you on the laptop rn
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know
It shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be more than 10 for one bagel
Shit was fire
And the highest piss concentration in the air
@kaori_flute go to sleep
should I be worried about getting the pfizer shot and experiencing a bad case of feeling impending doom?
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so close!
All it did to me was made my arm sore for like 3 days so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say not
good to hear
that it's not a bad thing, not about your arm being sore
mine is also sore..
but I heard it reacts with anxiety disorders? can't recall where
oh, really? I had it in the morning, then went back to my apartment and slept
The shots affect everyone differently but tbh i didn't get symptoms just my arm was sore for a few days
not to scare you but mine was pretty bad eeK
I just feel uncomfortable there
Oh my goodness I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sorry to hear that
Yeah that definitely is bad
Where do you work?
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think the sharp9 really communicates the function of that note
For no damn reason
I haven't been there in a while actually
U dont like it?
Actually my perception of time has been warped since covid last time I went was 2019
I keep forgetting 2019 isn't last yr
Damn i like chipotle
Is it that bad over there üò≠
their avocados were grown in fucking chernobyl
I take a bite of their guac and it is HARD
Guacamole is easy to fuck up
no, the avocados are just bad quality
But it most def cant be hard
The fuck
and during covid chipotle was the most sus place near campus by far
you tried bibibop right?
No never heard
No cuz legit the staffing issues were just thru the roof. Currently repressing what happened üò≠üò≠
I'm visiting this monday
We like casecord tho
fair
So fucking mean and for what
Cuz your face
its slightly dead but it had some good moments
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Scary LOOKING
Idk it looks dead
I'm not finna hate on OSU cuz they accepted me as well üíØ
DONT BE LYING
Ramadan messed up my sleep schedule lowkey tho
My calc teacher got sick of it he didn't even email me he just sent me 5 question marks hoping I'd explain my absences
Cuz of quarantine
But 2021 i had to work, i broke my fast on beef Jerky water and an energy drink a few times üíÄüíÄ shit slapped fr
It was mediocre from covid but still not bad
Eid last year Covid was still a thing
It was worse last yr üíÄ
It was better last year for me welp
Fuk i didnt see it üò≠üò≠
U good fuck calc
Actually calc isn't bad
And quite frankly I didnt give af towards the end unfortunately
Senioritis fr got me i didnt think it would
calc teacher is a 66 year old man
the kicker is that he wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have even  noticed if i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up
one girl literally did not go to a single class all year and she still passed i think
Once I discovered when teachers share their screens they can't see who leaves it was over üò§üò§
Left English class so many times
some people would leave right when breakout rooms happened
Cuz towards the end of the yr we had a big essay due, and the teacher would just ramble and say stupid shit. I did the bare minimum+essay that's all I needed to get an A
Senior yr was a fucking mess.
There was a silver lining tho, playing video games while in class üíØ
so with some teachers you could get away with it, some you couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Fr. Cant stress this enough.
Idk the stats for my school but i saw a lot at graduation
my dad√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s college literally sent me 3 paper applications in the mail
Theyre still fucking emailing. Dude the semester is about to start
Y tf are they still sending emails

Stop trying to force people to do what they dont want to do
Sorry, I don't think personally that people have a right to bring a deadly disease into a common area /shrug
It's not fascism. It's common areas where you eat, live, shower, study, and sleep.
Would you like help with uploading your card? I'm being serious
If you have it turned in then you won't have to quarantine before coming
You sounded so serious
It also sounds like I didnt fucking ask.
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell if u guys are joking with each other or going for the kill

I BROKE MY PHONE FOR 5 DAYS
I LOST SO MANY BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS OF UTAH
DAS PAIN
also couldn't talk to friends for a while ;;
Zhanda you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep doing this
You have to stop claiming one thing while posting an image that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually show what you described
Idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true
But zhanda has a habit of claiming one thing and then posting a screenshot that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t support it
And usually it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just annoying but in this case it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually quite bad because that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a really serious accusation he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s making
The messages aren't popping up for me for some reason, I would have to assume we'd have to hear it from him personally, but I haven't seen what uve seen so idk
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even SAY SHIT OMFG
My bad im being a bully
U be ight tho
I've missed you friend üò≠
I'm so sad I lost all the amazing photos I took tho :Sobbingcrying:
I replied to the wrong comment
unfortunately my phone kicked the bucket beforehand
I only fell once
I fell but if I hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been hanging on to the rope I would 100% be dead rn
oh damn
more like boring
Oh cool. Always wanted to go to Zion
I do wish I was able to save pictures tho
Cross country, so we stopped somewhere and it was really starry
I wanna go cross country with my friends after college
tho I'm sure I can snatch two more in college
I want to go to the Grand Canyon
Any destinations u want to go to?
I guess back to zion
tho
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in Fresno in a month and I (hope) to drive to Lake Tahoe and stop by at Yosemite

Two Man U kids missed the penaltyüòÇüòÇ
Who did you want to win?
Fuck england üò≠üò≠ quite literally everyone but the English was rooting for Italy
One of the English players didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even hit the ball in on one of the PKs
That shit was so raw
And I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been wrong yet lol
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad Italy won since I thought I was going to lose my streak...
Good shit dude wtf thats crazy
Ik but the Italy vs England game was soo close that I got lucky for that one tbh
I started watching the game a little bit late, so I missed England√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s goal in the first three minutes
Like what happened lol
I missed the beginning as well I wasn't home
question: Are you rooting for Biden in the 2020 elections?

Tbh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a preference since as a man from Macau I support Portugal
I think Case pushed it back because they need some time to process AP scores
English football has always coached by conservative Brit GENTLEMAN who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do offense
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why they lose all time
To be fair, they did make it to finals...
I also think that the English keeper is a lucky fucking duck
His height definitely gave him an advantage over the English keeper; however, even without the height advantage, he was still a WAY better goalkeeper
Technically ty the English training system u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find an English mid field who is a play maker
They were making such a big deal out of those two last minute subs for england and then both those mfs missed their penalty kicks
19 years old chick for the last penalty
I respect Kevin de Bruyne though, given that he did come back to play for Belgium after fracturing his eye socket üò¨

Those last two stats don't seem that bad though since my city (Houston) just got listed as having third-worst traffic in the US
So traffic isn't bad
According to a new Texas A&M study, the three cities with the worst traffic are New York City, Boston, and Houston

I DIDNT SAY CLEVELAND WAS A FLEX
CUZ APPARENTLY IM BEING CLASSIST
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually not being cringe in this conversation
Just cuz im trying to confront classism doesn't mean its cringe. Says a lot. Didnt know I was surrounded by bezos lovers
Not a commie tho
oh i didn't continue what i was saying
u'll get both love and hate for it either way :LAUGHING:

Queens is still ass

How about we stop accusing each other of stuff they clearly aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t :)
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even mad
yea i don't wanna stop
my goal wasn't to get u mad tho
Yea I mean accusing someone of being arabphobic on a public server isnt exactly √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbreaking y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all balls√¢‚Ç¨
damn wtf is happening

Oh shit
Wrong ping

~~tbh will accept tmw cuz my phone is at 2% and it's also too far~~

I have to air squat in the showers
I wish I was a bit shorter
rip :LAUGHING:
benefits of being short: u can swing ur feet
benefits of being tall: at least you are not short
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m 6√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢1 and a half
Im surprised none of my parents are taller than 5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢6
oh my
You clearly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know zhanda
oh man
moral of today's story: you don't know zhanda
How many more people need to sign it?
I can feel it
But i cant feel it
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good feeling
I almost forgot it was my birthday except every fucking business on the planet texted me like GIVE US M O NE Y
My class just got cancelled for the day
I can buy a gun but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rent a car
My wounds are pretty much all healed up and I can take a shower without screaming in pain :D
And didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize I fell until I was on the ground
oh and sam
they just phone discord HQ?
damn so you'll hit two weeks RIGHT before movein huh
I just don't have a vaccination card to send to UHS until I get the second dose
you got so lucky omg
if u dont have one, email them about it
I'm having trouble believing it was the relentless tapping of my phone against my shoulder that did it
I went into "Manage User"
I'm saying I don't have any privileges
Oh
OH
Bro I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think iPhone has it
you're not missing any features though
Oh
Idk how discord chooses
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have an about me
the part that says "dildo gelato" is a local note only visible to me though
OH
Not yet
Cuz before my update I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have user profile
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Oh idk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mind tho
I think when I first downloaded the desktop app it asked if I wanted auto updates
and I haven't seen it manually update in a while, either... so maybe it's not even like that anymore
the default one doesn't do that
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that jsut nitro
Oh
I've been using the stock one for a while now though
I just forgot that I switched back
though I don't think discord cares as long as you don't modify the client to, idk, steal tokens or bypass rate limits or eat newborns
nope
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t format my text the correct way so the joke kinda doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work actually
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m wayyyyyy to tired to make sense rn
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
i want to sleep
I napped for 2 hours but that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t enough
I mean, open source projects are lower on the susometer than, say, an already compiled modified discord client .exe that a 14 year old called "xXx_Gavin_xXx" DM'd you
which almost guarantees no bad stuff
Ah shit
Oh
Raunak is smartest when he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tired @everyone
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry my brain isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t working
this one isnt bad but idk if it's playlist worthy
dont you just like turn on a faucet
We tired af
Cuz he wanted a bath maybe
idk if it was
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so
Wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it just a joke
no it wasn't
it wasnt a joke?
Idküò≠üò≠üò≠
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say it was
Someone got offended about this üò≠üò≠

Cuz he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an abuser!
Oh yeahhhhh

Except 74 of them is him being a wiener
mashallah means
by God's will
both arabs and muslims use it cuz it technically refers to giving compliments
On your head
ON YOUR HEAD BUFFOON
Why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we just insult without needing to direct people to said insult
Well I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on discord so obviously I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m bored and have no life
It just popped up in me head
At least it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not dead and boring
although I do get lost at times
doesn't have to be pretty things
Damn there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already a class of 20215?
damn

how are you supposed to kiss the homies if you're in a relationship
You can still platonically kiss the homies in a relationship
but i don't think that they would be okay with that yknow
if i were in a relationship i wouldn't want my significant other to be kissing the homies on the side yknow
The only homie I kiss is my dog
idk what i'm saying rn i'm real tired i apologize
anyway i don't mean to demean anyone in a relationship \
I think there isn't even an option for it
I've translated soooo much software into Macedonian, funnily enough
nani the fuck?
my birthday ain't until sunday
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still more to go
You are either very late or extremely early
Congratulations on your med school admission this spring
three months early
HOWD TOU FIND ME
I DELETED THAT SHIT
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go away √¢‚Ç¨¬¶
BRO IM NOT EVEN 18 yet
Oh I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even notice that
We ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even concerned about your age anymore
ok ok sorry my brain processes one thing at a time
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s someone younger than raunak
Nope
because I went to a Macedonian high school for two years, skipped my third year, and then went to international school for two years
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know him
damn you are
2002 supremacy and I will die on this hill
zach is my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s age and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pretty lame
I can't really chat rn but I got a notification so I checked and here we are. but I'm doing good
Same shitüò≠
I like how I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually in the Class of 2024, but no one has realized it
and all it took was for someone to wish everyone a happy birthday
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even play w me rn
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say I still have 2.5 years but time flies really fast
Sorry üòî
Lol don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be sorry haha
I was literally 16 until last week ü•≤
don't know
the '23 server is pretty much dead
Oh sorry to hear that
it's been dead for the better part of like 2 years by now
don't be
*oh*
and then it's mimicked by a computer
anywho, the whole genre of streaming using a model has gotten really big in the last year and a half
most of the time, a vtuber doesn't really need any hardware aside from a computer and a camera
although an admittedly beefy computer
there's a lot more involved, with the whole suit, helmet, facial camera up close
so you don't really get a ton of the facial expressions and details
don't actually know
but it's just a byproduct of the fact that you don't have as much equipment
so the computer is doing a lot more of the heavy lifting
the new iPhone thing
Oh
also, who doesn't want to see an anime girl talking to you in real time?
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watched too much anime
after one incident from last year, china just generally isn't fond of the market
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus dawg i don't want to see you watching anime anymore
the CCP can go fuck itself
It's supposed to be the CPC üò≠
too hard
there's just too many of us
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong with the CCP?
i'd rather die
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing wrong with being a communist
there isn't anything wrong with being a communist
that's not my issue with the ccp, even though they're very blatantly non-communist in terms of how they perform economic policy
China hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been communist for quite a while now
not since the 70s
which is fair
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t agree with this tho
but i got messages erased just for saying that hong kong might not be totally in the wrong
i didn't even say hong kong was fully in the right and the CCP was in the wrong
From an American's perspective, it's very dumb, but the China-Taiwan conflict traces its roots to a decade of bloody civil war
the taiwan issue i feel more annoyed about because of the fact that the nationalist party of china is very much in control of the island of taiwan
they've never been in control of the island
they didn't even invade the island
but to be fair
The UN ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t doing shit let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s be honest here
the UN has all sorts of its own problems
also stupid slow due to the whole security council deal
of course they aren't
and the CCP never invaded the island
they didn't for sure
However this situation will go Taiwan will never be the benefactor in this
this is fair
No the west is far from innocent it's the whole damn instigator
fair, but china also has far more power
what sucks the most is that it's never about Tawian's autonomous rights or the people's rights in the first place
Never was and never will be
It won't serve any purpose other than symbolic recognition of the nation, which will only lead to further tension between China and Taiwan
i'm not saying it would fix everything
heck, it would most likely cause more problems than it would solve
Except that it will also give them representation
So in  fact it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do nothing
it really pains me to see people of the same roots trying to kill each other
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus what the actual fuck
Someone named Guo did that and I blocked him
i don't have an alt
trust me, our exec is smart enough to realize that if we did that, we'd get in trouble with the university within the hour
because we already don't have the most stellar of reputations, and we've been working hard to bring it up
we have enough to deal with without dealing with slander too
And nobody would ever suspect him, so he would get away with it easily
still?
Idk tho
4.5 hours of sleep lesssgo
@raunakwastaken you need a black kurta though
Honestly idk
Red tho
Mine isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bright red
There is some work on it
Idk what
Idk what it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called either
But I can feel the design if that makes sense
i hate wearing traditional chinese clothing
which is why i hate wearing it
Ccp wants to know your location
i never wanna do it again
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know Zhanda Chen
not really ROYALTY
Indian clothes are more comfy than a western suite tho
That actually looks comfy compared to indian clothes but I may be wrong
these ones don't look too bad
oh THIS is horrible
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worn Indian attire in so long
Sad
Bro I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even buy clothes at all in China üò≠
Nothing fits üò≠
i don't buy clothes in china
Oh my god the pants are so long and the fabrics is just so no stretchy
Ikr the world is missing out
never will
Oh honey
Oh
Then why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you marry him
Gay marriage isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t allowed in Pakistan
I want a corset
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never worn a corset
think a bra, but it also covers the stomach
Wrong person
sorry
What did I miss?
Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t *you*

@Deleted User If Young Metro Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Trust You, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m Gon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Shoot You
I wrote mine on dying
I wrote my common essay about something that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even remember
Isn't that the thinkbox?
I remember discretely because back when I was 3 and I would be in an elevator with my mom and whenever someone goes to a high level I would ask my mom if we would survive had the elevator fell from that level
I used to do that, but if someone finds it, I have no privacy
Ohüò≠
So ppl aren't left behind
No no I mean the health service
Oh
I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need condoms √¢Àú¬∫√Ø¬∏
Oh but No I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if I have social anxiety but I do have anxiety
they're not always on duty though lmfao
Some schools don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have the bare minimum though
Their hours were a little cut due to covid but they'll be back in full
Also I look ugly as fuck
Theres something chaotic about a kid in full EMT gear taking a quiz and then his radio starts going off and him trying to get the call and finish the quiz
You haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even seen him lol
Damn
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean that. Check my text after that
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what my personality is
I love myself! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just that other ppl can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see my beauty üôÑ
They can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see that I am created in God√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s image üôÑ
Oh
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give him any ideas
I hate myself the only thing I ever loved is üê†
THATS WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY AND RAUNAK DIDNT GET IT WHEN I SAID DEJA VU
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been wanting to go to Cleveland ever since I saw that there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an aquarium

Pri and I used to say that we hate each other all the tome
Hate is a strong word !
Additionally, have you ever tried Walleye or Yellow Perch
Like if we ended up going to campus Cutter woulda been a mess in the fall
Bruh you still hate me though let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s be honest
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know who you are
One of my all time favorite is catfish cuz that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what there were a shit ton of at the beach 10 minutes away from where I lived so I went fishing a lot
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t enough for her√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

Damn
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m more active on WhatsApp tho
My favorite part about WhatsApp is how when someone sends you something, it automatically gets downloaded into your phone
U can turn that off but I agree its so fucking annoying
The uprooting of generations of people to establish an ethnostate isn't victory
I've used it twice !
OH HELL NAH YOU DIDNT
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe I have to use this video

Inside joke
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m Muslim and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get this joke üò≠
What happened with the girl
Shes bigoted brother dont mind
Her dad didn't like her dating a white guy so he'd say mean shit to me in Tamil and also would only let her watch movies with me if they were in Hindi or Tamil with no sub titles so I'd wanna go home
Oh sorry my dude
Fuck Emory they rejected me
As someone who wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t allowed to date I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t blame her
I feel sorry for her
We trying hereüò≠üò≠üò≠
So it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t so badüò≠
Yeah it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Thankfully my parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what life 360 is but they do track my location
Except for the fact that we almost run into her mom once üò≠
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t track meü§™
Nearly had a heart attack üò≠
that sucks wtf
See age means nothing for brown parents
I mean yeah but idc I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do shit anyway
but still
Is there an app installed on your phone or is it a collar
Find my iphone
Oh
It is but you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reason with it
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know brown parents
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recall the amounts of times my ex abruptly hung up on our facetime bc her mom just bursts through her door unannouncedüò≠
My parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like high schoolers dating but this is too much man
Nah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think much of it
In China they publicly break you up in front of your whole class if you had a relationship
Shit let me pick this back up
I mean you are living in Cleveland during the school year, so I guess that makes sense
THEY LEGIT ARE AGAINST ANY FORM OF RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE COLLEGE
Let alone marriage
None taken sir
Bruh you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be dead if they saw the shit you pull on discord LMAOOOOO
No and I probably wont date in college
Oh teachers in China are horrible
School in China is just living hell
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so much worse than your stereotypical tiger parents
I'm lost
You don't get whipping?
No they don't whip me right now but I used to get whipped
I mean I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really do anything stupid for that to happen
In front of the whole class
Idk
Same except mine would be a full on beating
damn
damn nice
Good for you for fighting back but god damn
Asian parents only do that to like really young children to assert authority but they usually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t past the age of 13-15 cuz that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s basically abuse
Nope
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t blame my parents for it because their parents did the same, as did theirs
if I had kids and I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know better I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d do the fucking same
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to hit
That's why I won't physically punish my kids because I want to end the generational hurt there
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just a vicious cycle and it has to end
Cuz if u dont theres no communication
I do it anyway tho
Idgaf if their feelings get hurt, they'll get over it
Moses what's the worse thing you have done
They won't stay mad forever
WORSE THAN ER???
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that easy man. It hurtsüò≠
My mom once almost broke my ribs
And broke my arm
Damn wtf
Oh no
Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fun now but holy shit the nightmares that followed
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sorry
the worst, actually shitty thing I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done is that time I stole my friend√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Lego√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when I was eight
There would be nights when I would just cry after a bad whipping because it felt so unfair and unjust
Things hurt when they say shitüò≠
Like that Shit wears you down emotionally
No THEY WERE REGULAR LEGOS why was I so terrible
And my parents wonder why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call üòé
Well I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have siblings
The whipping isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even the worst part when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actual punches and kicks you know you done for
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all this sucks. Why did we go thru such bad things? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m proud of us for getting thru it
Cuz shit
*sigh*
have i walked in on a serious convo üëÄ
My parents just kinda broke me when they BOTH talked to me and said the reason they fight was because of me :fingerguns:
The stereotype about Asian parents is not entirely founded on myth unfortunately. But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a cycle because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a generational habit. The current generation in rural China probably perpetuates this cycle.

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say the psychological ramifications this practise has on Asian Americans in particular are that along with being a minority, they grow up with a massive inferiority complex because they get the feeling that not even their own family has their back.
Well I'm somebody who you can talk to about getting some help with that, and also the thing about college is that FERPA protects that information from your parents. They can't call and demand into your room, or call your RA and demand to talk to you, nor can they even call and see your grades if you don't release that info to them. They aren't privy to any disciplinary information either.
Yes but it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t justify it
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think a broken arm is justified Oscar
Anyway my parents aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t _that_ bad compared to some of the stuff I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve read today, but lol it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just _wrong_ to raise your hand on your own
I mean they all just wanted me to be successful and they get frustrated
that does not justify their actions tho
I hate that excuse because I hate how they have the arrogance think your success is completely THEIR accomplishment
That doesn't even bother me anymore what I'm bothered by is that they have the nerve to take credit for "raising me right" when I damn well raised myself
For crying out loud before elementary school and some parts of elementary my grandmas raised me
Let me guess, the child imitates the parents?
Maybe that explains why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a personality
Oh
After that incident I promised myself that I will never turn out to be like my parents no matter how bad things got
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably going to be stricter than my parents, but pigs will fly before I raise my hand on my own child
I also want my kid to have a life of their own
u see this shiz and realize it and wanna work on it
Guys please don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make me cry it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 11 pm
How was work
I'll be there for you until the day one of us is no longer living
This is a process that we can only go on alone. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand and why I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m kinda pissed that my parents want to be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìoverinvolved√¢‚Ç¨ (their words not mine) in my college life. Like leave me alone pls I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not as irresponsible as you think
One of these days Zhanda I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to tell you things you wish you never heard
FUCK ITS 12 DAYS UNTIL MY FLIGHT
SHIT
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve become a better student and person because of that motto. I always push myself to do more and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stray away from my end goal
Zhanda has actual facial hair, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still waiting for mine to grow back
I don't have facial hair üíÄ üíÄ
Why tho are you a woman
Jenin when we talked that night my hair was cut üò≠

I actually don't know, but it's DIII so
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do sports:uwu:
They've only lost 2 games since I've been at case. We hang 60 on ppl all the time
I already have the perfect bod so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really need exercise
I emailed the track coach about walking on and mf sent me requirements way higher than the average performance last year üò≠
I used to do a few sports, but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve recently picked up ping pong and soccer again
I guess it gets more competitive every year?
ahah spent too much time on discord gotta sleep
I have yet to find a gymbuddy
Then again I can just go and find one there
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do gymsü•≤
That ain't competitive that's sadüò≠
The only two things I do are running and swimming and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m bad at both
I hate running but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ok at swimming
We got 2 damn pools
i got yelled at because i never swam properly
at girl scouts i wasnt allowed to go in the deep end because i couldnt pass the test
Holy crap when my uncle went on a run with me he kept criticising me and telling me how to angle my foot
You could conceivably fail at running and crack ur skull on the pavement
And because the shallow end was over your head
i hate u
im not that short
They run like kangaroos don't let them fool you
Never learned how to swim
I dont run 4 meters
How do you want me to run 400
I'm ngl im scared shitless üò≠üò≠
I'm not trynna pay someone else tuition
Idk y I never got the hang of it
Fuck that school
My town is building a new school and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re spending millions of dollars on it, but still no swimming pool smh
That sucks smh, and the school itself has a swim team? Cheap asses
Bimza7 @kaori_flute I don't hate the school üò≠

Kool aid just keeps getting SLANDERED
hug
And upset that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to take 18 credit hours w sages
Im Just really scared because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m only taking like 4 classes now
14 creds is good for anyone who isnt insane
personally i suck at being insane and at time management soooo
Drew√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 105 class is separate
when I can find a round trip deal for 1200 without even doing much price checking
OH
you must realize, case doesnt care about saving you money
they want to have you spend as much as they can
cuz then more goes to their pockets
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve heard of some bad experiences with spirit
Yeah I won't actually go with them. I'll probably pick Southwest or Delta
Driving in my case takes longer, is more dangerous, and is more expensive than flying, so I'm definitely flying
I wanted to drive but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to do it alone and for 3 days
Yeah but I want to have my car
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you live in ohio
Doesn't parking cost a lot of money?
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad so I can manage
I don't make things up
The US government says that airline fares have risen by 24.6 percent over the last year :cursed_flushed:
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not too bad considering I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been flying from China to Detroit and then to Orlando
but yeah pray for me i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to be in a car with my mom and my grandma for 7 hours straight through upstate new york
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably only be able to sleep for about half of it
Whenever I get in a car I pass right out
Which probably isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a good thing
don't use spirit for your first flight
but spirit is a bad choice for your first flight
which is not what you want when you're moving in
just did my music theory placement exam
so i didn't pay any extra
damn
i think i got every single question right except for the ones about stuff i never learnt
aka the last two questions
You never hear a crack head say √¢‚Ç¨≈ìman I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not gonna smoke crack today I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any money√¢‚Ç¨
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let a crack head out hustle you
i thought delta didn't charge extra for checked bags but that may just be for international flights since those tickets are already v expensive
shit i didn't book my flight yet
its only a placement exam
can't be me
idk what airlines go to hk
don't fly with united airlines
those mf's i stg are annoying

America is actually underrated by people that have lived here for their entire lives, there's a reason for why so many immigrants want to come here
Well yes but existing issues in America arent getting better; they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re getting worse
And shit like republicanism
I want to move to Canada üò©

Ahh okay, I don't know about your itinerary, but the Museum of Art is not far from Little Italy and it closes at 9pm

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know her
I cant count my cousins
I'm sure there's more I dont know about
Ppl be like yea I have *number* of cousins and I just cant relate whatsoever üò≠
R u close with them
I feel like with cousins its either really close or u fucking hate them
No damn reason
I feel bad tho they had to go thru that shit alone üíÄüíÄ
No one was there for fafsa NOTHING üò≠üò≠ grateful I could learn from them
only my 21 year old cousin went to college
They musta went thru it üò≠
they go to the same college too omg
both he and my sister had one parent that did go to college though
Lmaoo same i have multiple relatives that went to the same state school
the others would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been first gen if they had gone
idk
she seems like a  mechE major?
I dont wanna discover more
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know I had a brother till I was 4
yet scotty, against all odds, still does not know
my dad has a half brother he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s never met
my dad doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that i know about his half brother
If you have, no spoilers please since I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watched the last episode yet
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, prob won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Oh üò≠
I've never watched a superhero show or movie
Never got into them idk
I've watched death note and the 1st 3 episodes of aot. Been too lazy to continue aot
The first season is good, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so long, so I understand why you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t continue
And legit like I have no fucking attention span anymore
Idk wat happened
Its not bad honestly it looks like a good show
And death note i liked. Just didn't like the last quarter episodes
I was recommended silent voice but it sounded corny so I didn't watch
holy fuck watch it ASAP
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Please don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Most animes are corny though
Corn is good but I dont like it that much
I hate irl corn but I thrive in metaphorical corn
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just close my eyes
arkansas doesn't exist
No it does i know someone from there
Fuck that cunt
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like to fuck this c√ë‚Ä†nt: :TTrump:
ok kasich vs. dewine who's worse
Honestly dewine didnt do bad with the pandemic. Ohio did better than most states with vaccinations. I believe everyone was eligible for the shot a few weeks earlier than most states
He did decent even tho it seemed like he was trying to appeal to trumpies at the same time
true but regarding other policies tho
I'm not sure honestly haven't done much research on dewine. If im not mistaken they still both support trump so they can go fuck themselves
premarital eye contact
U right. My bad
But I think his vote in 2016 alone is bad üò≠
fair fair
Idgaf. 4 yrs too late
this thing sucks
Damage was done. And the republican complacency and strong support for that piece of shit says a lotttttttt. Quite sad.
Hes so fucking ugly man I feel bad
Actually I don't feel bad
Fuck him
I'm joking üò≠üò≠ hes just a hypocrite dawg. He says something then contradicts himself. Hes been complacent about trump even till today. Like he would say trump is guilty regarding the insurrection, then yd u vote not guilty and not let the impeachment trial start till after trump left office? Not to mention his policies and constant obstruction. Hes an overall piece of shit who only does shit for his benefit. He doesn't work for the American ppl he works for himself
Na he knows wtf hes doing
I didnt ask tho honestly.
Oh so if
Fuck you
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
What are you trying to imply here?
Is it cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a woman Yousef?
Wtf !
I didnt say that !
Do u think im misogynistic cuz im arab? Bigot dude bigottttt
CUZ IVE NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT YOU BEING ARAB
U didn't need to mention it. Ur vibes were off
ITS CUZ IM BROWN ISNT IT?
YOU HATE SOUTH ASIAN PEOPLE HUH?
Oh wowwwwwww !

I thought it said shay2an shay2an I was like wtf?
Bigotry isn't a joke but okayyy
Shes being a fucking xenophobic racist pos
Oh
what's wrong my brother
ITS CUZ IM A WOMAN RIGHT?
Its cuz im stateless
Lady Loki was stupid
I feel like the kiss was just a distraction
People told me there was a post credits seen for the season finale and I was soooo disappointed when I found out it was just a clip revealing Loki season 2 üò≠
It was just a clip where someone stamped Loki√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s file and it read √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLoki season 2√¢‚Ç¨
oh
He won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hook up with anyone except himself
And fuck other animals
At the receiving end
I guess Loki doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about bio lol
Yah and he did transform into an animal, so I guess his whole anatomy is different so that he can breed with another animal
Jesus Christ bends over and sucks King Shah ii's dick
Sorry

My job took me to health services today and apparently people started flooding the verification page so it's likely
i don't like this, this is evidence that the punishment system is more effective than the reward system
I guess it is that a reward isn't something that everyone would want but punishment is something everyone would avoid
they did a drawing and gave someone 6 months free tuition
well damn
And this isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t evidence that punishment is always better b/c this punishment is way worse than the reward is beneficial i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d argue
It didn't matter for most undergraduate students though since half off tuition is much more valuable for most undergraduate students than free parking
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably going to grab dorm stuff at stores near Case since I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to bring as much with me
Since the punishment is guaranteed, while the reward is unlikely
Unvaxxed people have to quarantine though :cursed_flushed:
i see so many dogs in the dunkin drive thru
oh, that showed up in mine a few months ago
they would never knowüëÄ
Even before the official school acc
I never lost my virginity cuz I never lose :alphagigachad:
they can't
They can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
That feels wrong
virgin galactic won't take you in unless you're pure
It tastes like shit
Forgot the name
Cuz
Butterfingers really fell off.
No wtf ?
Oh..
My bad
WHO THE FUCK EATS THAT
the fuck shut is that
I cant be the only one who knew what red vines were üò≠
Okay well I worked in a retail store that sold them
SO fuck u
twizzlers isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t good
Dont catch an attitude
Idk who tf doesn't like twizzlers?
OH?
Ok why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you like them
cuz they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taste good
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taste good, what else is the reason
They killed my first born? Is that the reason you wanted
IS IT CUz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a WOMAN
We need them for the environment
fuck off
Soup when ur sick tho üî•
Where did drinking soup when you're sick come from
When I'm sick the only thing that I can drink is ice cold water
nah
it was slow pane
Yes if I have a cold chicken noodle soup is fire
If I have a cold I wouldn't even eat hot food
let alone soup
because u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the risk of scorching beverage on ur hand
U just started working there right
ehh i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been working there for a bit now
i earn so much in tips i fail to realize
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve earned probably like $200 in tips so far
I'm pissed :PepeCry:
what happened
Was it bad?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sick of not getting closure at the end ü•¥
Oh
Oh is it the
idk
Zhanda can you believe my mom's fucking boasting about beating me as a kid like some kind of fucking accomplishment
She simply does not give a shit
That is really lowlife; no parent in their right mind would brag about punishing their kids, let alone beating them as a form of punishment
What's worse is she's looking after my cousin since my aunt has work and she's on summer break and I'm afraid she's boutta go Mayweather on her too
But not really
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna spoil üòÇü•µ
The book is a little confusing and stupid
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want my rating to be taken the wrong way
idk how they find me
I need to think√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
I don't think there are as many prominent worms of literature in the Soviet era as there was previously, because intellectual thought was mostly guided by the government5
Which is why I liked Gorky's work
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been meaning to read gulag archipelago for a long time but I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten around to it
I could never
my half sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s half brother thought the country of jordan was named after him
it is tho
i sleepy
i wish
i need to go to bed
but i only work until 10 so
then on saturday i work 6-2 üòÉ
I cant i really can't wake up that early
my managers making me out in long early hours then giving me shit for hours next week
i went from 34 hours to 24 hours to 17
what happened
Not anymore
Talk to them see if u can pick up shifts or something, never hurts to ask
they hate me
and my hours are only going to get worse
Who ur managers? Fuck them
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s annoying
and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m putting in my two weeks right before my surgery
Damn !
so they going to either overwork me or give me bad hours
sad
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have an app
Yeaaa one time I broke something and she let it slide üò≠
She was so nice we would fuck around and chill in the cash office for a bit üò≠
Ah. Honestly just do what u can do to get the hours u want. I would assume they'd rather have u working than training someone else/going thru another hiring process
this is a temporary job for me, for making a little bit of money before going to school
I hate that shit üíÄ
It sucks
I quit tho üíØ
idk why places don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
Except for 2 people I went to hs with
Yup. Only problem some managers don't fucking look at the schedule since its a computer that does it
So on days where those 2 people weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there my shifts would feel so long
drive thru cash stress me out though
i get yelled at for mistakes that aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mine
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do drive through
So many of my favorite coworkers quit, shifts were starting to feel long but I wanted to leave anyway, that just gave me even more reasons to quit üò≠
I only run the bakery even though I told them I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather be doing different things
i make drinks on drive thru and do drive thru cash
Fair
I just work the bakery which is where we also take orders
haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been taught to make food or take orders on drive thru
Managers always do tht shit, they'll have u do things u dont wanna do/things that others don't wanna do. Especially with newer workers
I knew the boss myself so I could do whatever the hell I wanted
Whereas you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that freedom at corporate companies
I agree. U can fuck around and not do shit
I actually hate working for a corporate company
they get stressed wrongly towards me and it makes me feel bad
Yeah, u aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really helping society as a whole by working at big places
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get min wage at the small business but at Panera I get paid less than what I used to make
Ah. Dont feel bad tho at the end of the day ur at work on time and u work. And especially during the worst of this pandemic thats great üò≠, so they should be grateful to have u
Getting yelled at by customers def sucks, but the skill of not letting it affect u is very important
Literally. I learned to not give a fuck and just call a manager
and drive thru cash isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very overwhelming
Like hey I get you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re upset but stfu and talk to my manager and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that
And if you still ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happy please go ahead and call corporate
Then there's the annoying fucks
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always the annoying fucks. They are omnipresent
I work at the mall so
Where do you work?
good thing my hs isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in my town tho
I used to work at walmart. I quit early July tho
we just have the mutual agreement to pretend we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know each other
Its not in cleveland directly but in one of the suburbs/small towns of cleveland. I lived in cleveland tho
i work with a girl who was my childhood friend
we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talk for a while but now we chill
my grandfather is picking me up at work tomorrow üíÄ
Because I hate most of them
Like if I see someone from my hs there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a very good chance I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say hi to them
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m cheating myself out of sleep as we speak
rn we dwindling down to 6.5 hours
why is it so hard to force yourself to go to sleep
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dead serious
Hannah go sleep
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the only espresso you need
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m perpetually tired
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just always exhausted <3
Still talk to friends though
also I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m super introverted so even being around someone will exhaust me
and boom I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m asleep
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna see most of my class ever again
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to my hs reunion so i can flex how i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t peak in hs
my hs has a really extensive alumni network
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never visiting England again
drifted from so many people already
@.fim. u still haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t followed me back on my alt
No me too. But i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really vibe with my hs friends and personally I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they were the type for me to be a better person so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mind if we have a falling out
A few HS friends I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talked to but for most I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just as close
They already hang out without me so
Me with some of my friends. With the rest I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still close
Idk how you could already have drifted if ur √¢‚Ç¨Àú25
We are bad at friendship
Yea online school sucks
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t meet people at all
In a few weeks you will
That phase is p much over though
Idk too many people from my grade
Yess. I've stayed close with a few tho
Bye Jeffrey
Fair
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to take my midterm early tomorrow
You took a class?
I was bored tho
The programming doesn't sound bad
But it turned into a year
Right I lowkey didn't do shit either
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick up on a new skill in the last year
@drake5899925 math major?
Oh ripppp
There are math major pre-meds but it's definitely an uncommon path
Not a math major
I don't even know what I should minor in since I'm doing environmental science
Like for food, air, and clothes
Idc what photosystem does what I just need to keep a plant alive so I get oxygen
When I say idgaf I mean like the complicated science stuff like ofc we rely on them and stuff but I dont need to know the detailed steps of photosynthesis
I miss when I didn't know photosystems and just knew that photosynthesis exists
*Imagine remembering the Krebs cycle after med school*
I hate that there's so much stuff we learn that isn't used
Like yall aren't even gonna use ochem as a doctor
I just remembered I have a baby pic that screams √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPriyanka doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about plants√¢‚Ç¨
Ok I sleepy gn
i forgive u cuz u used bamza7
2- i haven't slept yet
3- u spelled his name wrong
4- idk-?
You guys haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t met Howdy yet?
Nope
priyanka hasn't
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll change in a month though
Ik who he is tho
i've been to campus 11 months times
Jenin, can you kick me so I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t procrastinate sleep anymore?
Otherwise I would have taken it üò≠
Ok I'm going to bed pray for me y'all I'm trying to squat 315 tomorrow
not a damn soul
Are we supposed to sign up for this √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDiscover Cleveland√¢‚Ç¨ thing?
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really wanna civic engage
Why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I just move in and sleep until the next inauguration
Idk wat I wanna do with my life idk
Discovery week is literally the least concern of my school issues rn
My class schedule is still fucked up
My class schedule is tight
Math 122, csds 132, Chinese, and SAGES; next semester, math 201, math 223, phys 122, SAGES, and Chinese 2
Actually idk if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll still take Chinese 2
I could probably understand if you spoke it out loud though
Oh wowwwwwww zhanda
You even wrote it yourself an hour ago yousef üíÄ
But I forgot how
Idk if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the pinyin
Yeah it's close enough heng hao
But idk if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s right :NM_peepoNerd:
Racist fuck
Omg wtf lmaoo
That's the grade you got for the oral exam
Do you personally want to take Chinese?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking it this semester and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll find out ig ü§§üòÇ
I mean how hard can it get
I mean ig don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t underestimate it
Oh shit I forgot about that song
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember üòî
Maybe it was so bad I repressed it in my memory
a whack a day keeps the doctor away
I love animals until I remember that they shit on the ground and smell bad
I agree. Cuz y u shitting on the ground? Get on a fucking toilet.
That was a bad joke üòî
I dont think that's a healthy emote
Oh and not to mention the hot Thanos ones
I dont wanna ever hear shit about cleveland @lamarcindale
he can scratch that shit off his bucket list
I feel like you can just go there alone
everyone would make you feel at home
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really have to go with people
for example my dad is friends with a Chinese restaurant owner in Pittsburgh just cuz they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re both from Hong Kong
My friend speaks Cantonese and I speak mandarin and we can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand each other üòîüò©:peepoSwingSad: :NM_PeepoCryDrink:
Except state governments in the US have a lot of power
the you tiao in fujian hits hard
I mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably need some Asian food in my system after a week at case
How does sleeping work?
Bruh I literally have been trying to sleep for an hour
My body hates me
I chose 10:00 am and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m already second guessing whether or not I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna wake up that early
I just play my phone until I pass out
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take long
Bruh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m literally taking a break from Netflix and stuff until college starts
But you prob shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch it if ur trying to sleep
Shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you be binging Netflix until college starts?! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I hate being a responsible person sometimes
It sucks ass
Sorry bagel
I feel attacked
Sorry bagel
Just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ever disrespect my bagel bretheren
I will rain hellfire upon thee
Oh SHIT I just wanna share that my friend√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s roommate found out that he was pansexual and said in a Snapchat gc that he would get √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhate crimed√¢‚Ç¨ and one of the ppl in the gc reached out to my friend and told him to switch rooms ASAP and gave him photos of the chat logs √¢Àú¬†√Ø¬∏
BRUH WTF
Oh damn
But still
Like wtf
Dude who the fuck cares about sexuality, what an asshat
Wtf
Dude it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Alabama ü•∫ so idk how much they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll actually do but my friend already requested a room change
Dawg I can't go to any state universities in the south
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a stupid remark and nothing more but I have a Jewish uncle in Alabama and if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hide it you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get swasticas all over your car and stuff
Here is some cringe to lighten the mood of you want
Sorry I am sleeping
Something you wish you were doing
My name√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not Jeffrey tho üëÄ

On a computer rather
Does it only work on a computer?

Howdy, so students can live off campus starting Junior year?
I was supposed to have a roommate, but my roommate changed their mind
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to talk about it üò©
can't imagine *not*
i actually forgot
hey homies i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m back from work
I got started really getting into anime early January of this year due to COVID

Cya gl with work
~~work today at 1
last day~~
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be telling me i matter to god
cuz Person
oh lala
Yes this happened to me a few times as well
apparently not...
I mean, when they approached me and gave me a little card, I just told them I'm an ex-Witness and they racewalked away for some reason?
i prefer to stay away from activity that involves drug use
so it would help if i _didn't_ join a frat
so theres literally no fucking point for me
never have I ever actually gotten stoned, no matter how hard I try
I'm starting to think something's wrong with me
i want to abstain from drugs and alcohol for personal reasons
i also need to gradually sleep earlier
and go to sleep at 11 at the latest
mmm trying to get there gradually
Damn y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all wiling in highschool
I'm a good kid I don't do wiling
endorsed by half my former school
unfortunately, most do
actually, 99% of people who say it constantly are douchebags. the people who are high on life and don't rub it in anyone's face tend to be those who aren't
just ate a sesame bagel from my freezer
you can't find them in Armenia to save your life
i don't have noodle arms but i have noodle arms' characteristics
the pain after is fun
this emote keeps reminding me of kaori
Idk if you can tell how noodley they are
i can't
sorry we can't hang out a lot
they should give tw in the trailer tho
oh
But that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just what I told them cus I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know my height
but I feel like I have low standards
I need to find ppl shorter than me
sorry gia
but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like kids
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m short phobic
but it's so hard to find a 6'3 girl in Florida :Sadge:
if ur over 6 feet
we're gonna have to cut off some of your height
@legendsexile rip
but I still like them
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, you can take mine
I feel bad I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry Hannah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not actually short phobic üòî
but I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t grown in the last 4 years so
im sorry but thats the truth
or tell them to slow down
@legendsexile walk slow
My mom gets mad at me for "walking too fast" when I'm just walking
only time I walk fast is if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m late or on a hike
I like people of all heights I don't discriminate :NM_PepeSwag:
Yessir !!! Good shit
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t for friends but for dating I do :cursed_flushed:
Sry Hannah i cant date you üò©
Friends can be anyone though

Jk I don't do it for friends either I love my short homies
Short phobia strikes again üòî
You still forgot to troll me on insta

I find feet very disgusting so I'm about 12 iPhone 12 Pro Max's tall
Aw :(

I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watched anime in so long
Not really
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been like 3 weeks
Fat Albert !
I haven't watched that in a loooooooooooooooooong time
mhm drinking coke on an empty stomach is not the right decision
Drinking anything on an empty stomach is the best decision one can ever make
reminds me of when i drank like 3 shots of espresso on an empty stomach
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consume that much caffeine for someone who works at a coffee shop
To be fair it is my preworkout
Wtf man both these takes are blasphemous
These are literally the 2 sodas I dont fuck with üò≠üò≠
Literally every single person IK hates dr pebba
take the hint :KEKW: its a bad soda
i hate the taste of coffee
Teas decent tho
Speaking of caffeine this shit is fire
I want heart palpitations
Never tried it
Literally never seen that soda. Is it made only in a certain area
Last semester I was studying for mock exams and I downed 1.5 liters of dark roast
caffeine never hit me ever again after that
2 weeks caffeine
@Deleted User seems like it
I would do something similar with energy drinks at work üò≠
And I would barely feel shit
@Deleted User @lamarcindale I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t play gartic tonight I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going out to eat
Awwww
i want to try gfuel but the powder
But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just gonna translate wrong
gfuel just seems so expensive üò©
The cans are 24 oz and like almost 2 bucks each so its not that bad
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never tried gfuel and prob never will üòîü•≤
the tubs be expensive tho sheesh
Cuz it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s crack
Its same shit üò≠üò≠

Zhanda's offline rip

I think people playing Gartic phone pinged you since they wanted you to join
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably join soon ~~even though I should be doing work~~
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping to do research once I come to campus
Also I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do my work because the wifi is out throughout my area
Oh sorry to hear that üò©
The weather where I live isn't too good either
There was lightning for about 2 hours today and it was so bad, I thought power would go out
Oh

jeffrey you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even in the zoom call
Oh

yeah I'd wanna miss it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still on but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not there
i think rob, elie, and kethan are probably still there
cuz you're short
So if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m short then you are shorter
Sad.

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m reporting you to the office of equity

Cleveland is unfortunately
You have the freedom to be annoying but that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean you have to
You have the freedom to be annoying too yet you choose to
I'm gonna end it all
They can't get to me here
Imran Khan called he wants to know your location
Its ok raunak if they kill me I won't have to go to school or work ill be free from the capitalist cog üíØ
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just jealous that we can juggle 2 cultures
I think everyone who isn't native american has 2. European american counts even if the European part was abandoned
Leaving your own country just for school is cringe
FFFFFF I HAVE TO WORK
Go charge your phoneüôÑ
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so stupid
Good job do you want a medal?
It must hurt being that stupid
Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you go to sleep and do both of us a favour
Also, I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read whatever you deleted
Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you go hit with your coach so we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to talk to you
I did for a while but recently I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve come back to the realisation that she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s annoying af
Surprised you even forgot that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m annoying because no one ever forgets that
@absence000 you don;t play tennis do you
I suck
Me too but suck√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a verb here üëÄ
"I suck at something" is slang and that negates the transitive verb property
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an English speaker and idk what this means
Oh rule of thumb
Yeah but still a verb
damn i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired
u being awake late and me just waking up hello we are truly the chaotic duo
It's maintenance, they had a message saying that earlier but took it down early
You never existed, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listen to David. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just a figment of his imagination

Yea nah I can't drive
I have never turned off anything as fast as discord sticker suggestions
I have never in my life wanted to write "that's so sad" and follow it up with this
i just got out of work
i survived another day without walking out so
without walking out...?
like leaving
because i hate it
oh so leaving before your shift is up cuz you wanted to
Whats wrong with cod and rl howdy
howdy doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want me consuming caffeine
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like coffee
i like espresso drinks though
idk if i can handle only espresso
is that why you won't steal a donut?
My body couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t survive being vegan, if I gave up meat I 100% would go back into the underweight BMI
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to steal them
but it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be stealing if i took one
i would be overweight if i ate meat üòÉ
not really
but i had trouble digesting meat when i ate it
meet sucks anyways
milk is where it's at tho
wreaked havoc on my stomach
I have never ordered coffee in dunkin donuts üò≠
I have never ordered coffee
I've never had coffee :cursed_flushed:
I have I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like the taste of it.
it smells bad too
Sorry, I no longer want the coffee
you lost another customer Hannah
damn
ordering coffee seems too complicated
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really not
it hurts me
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t order it
Black coffee isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t THAT bad
your opinion is wrong
Dude im done with my internet
But is the internet done with you
some idiot cut our area's fiber wire yesterday so my area had no wifi until this morning
Ive never tried key lime pie

Cereal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s real hit or miss for me

I stop eating cereal for months and then go back to it and remember y I stopped
Okay I get that. I used to, but a year ago I fell in love

I want to
But can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
crying helps me fall asleep
Sigh bet imma try that
Same shit
Idk too much things happening rn
Its fire tho !
it's been a while since i listened to it
Sigh
got too much of it in school ngl
Something boring
idk how to fall asleep
i struggle to fall asleep and then i do
I just think about things that make me sad and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d just fall asleep real quick idk why
oh
but
sad things are the ones that wake u up
shit
But waking up does make me sad
nah im too groggy to be sad first thing in the morning
i only get 12 sessions a year tho
I wake up and stare into thin air for about 5 minutes everyday
exactly i liked to be left alone
i don't utter a word for the first hour of my day
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bad I just wake up confused a lot
Idk why
Lmfaoo dude I just sit there getting ready mad asf
oml too many sad people in the same place brb
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m only sad sometimes
I wake up hungry
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sad rn :blurryeyes:
Hi not sad rn
i can't open up
Cause you have a tendency to overshare
EXACTLY UGH
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t overshare as much anymore
why not 
i think the way we're doing it now is not right tho
priyanka my dms are always open if you ever need someone to vent to :lovaaaa:
I hear u. Shits scary
Bro I once had a dream my entire family cut me up and ate me and I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call them for a week straight üò≠
I dont blame u üò≠üò≠ thats scary asf
Worst part is they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say a word and just smiled while doing it üò≠üò≠
Its weird dreams are really interesting. There's a lot of theories on what it is, ur brain processing what happened, etc
Oh shit yea
I would like to know why my entire family wants me dead
Also Freud says dreams are wishes
i am sure they don't
But that doesn't make sense in a lot of cases
Damn I really forgot your name
Yea dont think too much of it
environmental issues
family
school failing 
annoying family members
Naw bro you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand Ik at least 3 people on my dad√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s side that wish I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gone üò≠
computer games
fuck them all
we want u here <3
crazy ass family members suck
My cat here ran to my school in the blad and I had to go get her üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Idk about my brother bc he at least used to love me
if my parents woulda stuck with them they wouldn't have made it to my grandma's passing
or they would've reached just hours before she passed
Then there was iklab around that I had to navigate and when I was inside the school I saw teachers from my hs in cleveland üíÄ
i had every reason to tho
Idk what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse my relatives disliking me or my mom saying she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have aborted me
Fuck them u dont need them dawg don't worry bout them
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like bearing guilt and shame especially to family
there is nothing to be ashamed about
Shame on my mom for trynna abort me but I did be a nuance to her for 18 years so Ig we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re even
you still aren't
your mom is wrong for thinking like that about her own child
Grownups are just weird back when I was like 8 I would go over to said aunt&uncle√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s place to visit and my mom would get really pissed at me about it bc they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like my mom either
priyanka has a point. I really doubt one is able to be a nuisance to *their own mother*, no matter what they did, and I also really doubt you did anything so much as slightly wrong or bad to her
Well I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never want to be dead weight to anyone and there were times I could tell my mom√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mad that I was around
I too have felt like I'm in the wrong just for existing because of my family members' reactions and body language, so I can assure you:
**you are NOT dead weight.**
I mean I never cared about what went on in between my family members but I kinda just got dragged into it
Literally like out of the blue my mom just told me about this whole √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthey hate me and I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve aborted you√¢‚Ç¨ situation one day and I was just really befuddled
But then again I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m away from all that now thank fuck for school
family problems and just in general not feeling comfortable in my own home were actually a driving factor for me to go out of my way to study and get into an international school
I can't say it was a net negative life choice tbh
me except out of state
if your family is not a good influence on you, and you stand to lose more than you gain, cut them off
being far away means i get to be far away
Idk I would assume to a certain extent
hi guys i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going out with my friend in half an hour and idk what to wear
can't really advise you unless we know the weather tho
I never put in effort üòÇ
Oh
a maximum of 4 weeks
idk
I hate dorm shopping
sorry i guess i was attempting to telepathically communicate with you david
I thought I felt something just wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sure what it was
I think I spent almost $500 already? and there's still so much to buy???
yeah sorry that was me
SAME it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like wtf how
Dorm shopping took so long and im willing to bet i missed some things. The only things i still have to get that i can think of it like a mattress topper (not counting notebooks etc.)
I've spent 0 so far
i put one in the stapler and idk where i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m meant to put the other one
then maybe a small plastic box? Idk how much are you stapling stuff?
Please don't eat it
Bruh wtf
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even want to know how much i spent
I can't tell if hannah is joking or not but i hope she is joking
he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually eat it
Alex you are so wrong
and they dont fit anywhere neatly
And then you can throw out all the shit after finals
I never understood the hype
college ruled notebook paper >>> wide ruled
but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t love the rocketbook so much
while we're on the topic of school supplies
noooo. nope nope nope
im sorry I have to disagree
i hate it
I know that but that doesn't mean they aren't evil
@toomanyzs will i need folders or like,,, is that not necessary
i hate folders
bye
i always lose them or break them or never use them
Do you know how many times they have gotten stuck, the rings didn't close properly, or the rings just tried to steal  fingers???
Alex, what happens if you get papers that aren't hole punched already, you have to punch them yourself. what are you going to do when you don't have a hole punch on hand?? Shove them in without the rings like a folder?
You know what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll use notebooks for this semester and if I fail all my classes I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll sue all of you
i only used a binder for calculus this year because my calc teacher literally gave us a whole textbook on paper
Some papers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have holes punched√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
Alternatively I could get a hole puncher but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not bringing that to class ü•∫
Idk but
oh damn
also everywhere under 21s can go closes so early omg
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stay out past 9pm even if i wanted to
Then I do all my practice problems
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m anti-binder though
i hate them
He's right tho
I didnt need to be attacked like this
I move in in 3 weeks teehee
Shoot I need to start packing
Sigh
I guess use your hand
OH
OH
I CANT READ
Damn what is it diamond crested or sumn?
I would feel bad for my dad to shell out money for 2 racquets
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry for choosing this sport
Idk what is the most expensive item I own
Probably my laptop?
I share a car with my fam so that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count
my lenses are more expensive than my racquet but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t include them because
*i need them to see*
Oh bruh ikr
oh damn
Why do I need to pay THAT MUCH
Yeah my prescription be badüò≥
Oh I should get my glasses updated prescription-wise
Oh crap I actually need to schedule my eye exam
Most expensive thing I paid with my own money is my pc
sucker ate a hole through my wallet
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve only had mine for like 9 months or so
wondering the degree to which the quality of my racquet impacted my tennis abilities
but a bad racquet will impact you negatively
Poor Zach
You attach the head to the handle or somethin?
I know someone on OSU√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s team (she used to play on my hs team) who has snapped 5 racquets in half so far in her tennis career
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know that mattered
Lighting it bad af but the ragout at the bottom is also made from scratch. I even crushed the tomatoes
I was bored\
And it took really long to cook so I made some rigatoni and ate that
When I make stuff I put out a blast about if anybody wants any to my building
But i am not bad with japanese stuff
I haven't tried to do chinese stuff but if I did I want to do real chinese dishes and not americanized chinese
prepare for a lot of oil splatter and crying "why"
Idk why that would be off the menu tho
hmmm I will need a wok if I actually want to do it right
What's a dish that is hard to fuck up but really good
Doesn't really matter, there's good selection of groceries here
√ß‚Äö¬∏√©‚Ä¶¬±√©¬¢ain't supposed to be spicy doe üò≠
Can't think of any other noodles
Damn it's been a minute since I've eaten zhajiangmian
I really want to take a crack at homemade sushi too
The problem is that I need fresh fish
damn it is past my bedtime
i went to sleep at 9:30 yesterday and now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired
I can't believe how many people picked up serious cooking since the pandemic
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been cooking as much since the pandemic
~~because if i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a schedule of any sort and am just staying at home all the time i lose all control and my life falls apart~~
That and not being able to go out to eat
Okay I make my risotto with riced cauliflower instead of rice and it fucking rocks
I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done it without all the degrading yelling :Sadge:
i have developed 2 recipes intuitively and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all i need
i am very good at cooking without dairy i think
When I'm not feeling lazy
damn
Cuz Dave's sucks in that aspect
i used to look at the menu for dining halls at colleges but now when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually relevant i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the examples :(
There are some top rounds that aren't bad for about 7 bucks
i need to go to sleep
Those with silver spoons up their asses turn their nose up
OH
DAMN THOSE GREENS ARE GOOD
I hate collard greens with a burning passion
You guys didn't get to experience this
Pretty far tho and I can't drive lol
Also the drinks are normally self serve and people will legit take milk jugs and fill them full of gatorade and shit
Do they have milk tho
That's really a case of bad manners
There isn't an unlimited supply of drinks and some of them tend to run out fast, so I don't understand why people fill entire jugs of a drink, leaving nothing for others
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink milk I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not a babyüòÇ
Oh shit that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually true
and a pot of plants to the left of it
and not in horrible amounts of debt
bold of u to assume that i leave campus
bold of u to assume that i leave ~~campus~~ room
stock up on ramen and never leave ur dorm room for 3 months
i was gonna say that but wanted to avoid another depressive convo smh
*this baby can hold so much imaginary money*
I haven't had ramen in so long
someone*
i always wanted to go out and eat more often last year
8 dollar sandwich god damn
He lives near DC
WTF
this was when i was in middle school
Oh
damn what kinda rich kid school's chinese class was this
herbert hoover middle school
damn
oh?
We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call it √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhoover stew√¢‚Ç¨ but our version literally the same
mf will retire and then have nothing left to do BUT sleep
wow its winston's school omg
nobody saw that shit
especially those hot dog bakery buns
chewy bread with a slightly cold, barely cooked hot dog
damn thing broke my brand new braces at one point
My own I have a really flexible back
nope
i say rice is still the clear winner here
I will renounce my membership though for health reasons
don't procrastinate kidz
Unless you can get someone to do your work for you
Yep I know that feeling
I just realized you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have nitro anymore Oop
Sorry to hear that
Hmm do you usually ask if the customer wants to leave a tip?
I mean, fair, but if you do that, then at least make an effort in pressuring restaurants and other such places to give livable salaries to their waiters, cooks and baristas
in Europe, tipping culture isn't as prominent, but salaries tend to be higher when weighted by standard/cost of living, y'know?
we have a service charge here
if you ordered takeaway or delivery in Armenia, the service charge was 0
China pays their employees a fair wage so there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just no tipping
oh
he basically fled armenia to india cause he didnt want to serve in the military for 2 years
but he is stupid
and got caught by the military
last i heard he is now serving in the military
nope
but i can't say it here
Oh
Has anyone been to the movies lately?
i went yesterday
won't say it was particularly great
I was gonna watch escape room but I saw this thing and temptation got the better of me and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sad
Breh I just triple scoop this dude finna be working out with god üò≠
LMFAOOO someone said u gon feel something alright. Then nothing üò≠üò≠
I dont think tolerance break would work at this point
I used to absolutely INHALE monster and coffee to study for tests
No trust me just quit cold turkey for a week
Oh I already drink about a gallon and a half of water every day
oh
i cut back as soon as i feel like i may be getting addicted to caffeine
Shit tastes ass but it gets the job done
i haven't had coffee in like a month
Damn a month??
~~mostly cuz i have a bad cough rn and can't drink iced drinks~~
it was awful a few weeks ago but im getting better slowly
my nurse is so dumb she said cold drinks would help sooth the throat and i thought lady i ain't taking your advice
and this antibiotic kinda helped idk
I only drink iced waters when I have a sore throat
really?
I eat cold food too
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any hot thing in my throat when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sore
cuz cold stuff aggravates my throat and i cough a lot afterwards
im the opposite i like hot drinks to sooth my throat
Well I spent years drinking cold water w mint so√¢‚Ç¨¬¶:pepeok:
i grew up drinking both room temp and cold water
My mom refused to let me drink cold water when I was little
my mom didn't refuse but strongly advised against it
my sister and my dad will only drink cold water and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand
if i have to drink cold water i will not put ice in it unless i need it for several hours
i would put ice in my water for tennis tho
I drink room temp water most of the time bc I am simply too lazy to make cold water
my fridge has cold water so
idk anyone whose fridge doesn't have a cold water dispenser
for tennis i would just have a hydroflask and my water stayed cold
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink water when Im doing tennis
i had a half gallon jug for my water
the girls√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ season was in the fall so for most of the season it was really hot
just cuz of how hot it was
oh
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t played any tennis in 2 years :NM_SadgeRain:
i haven't played a legit match in almost 2 years
im gonna try to play as much as i can before i move in cuz theres no way im gonna let myself lose my game
~~pray i don't shank sm üò≠~~
i just wanna hit tho
i can't believe so many people shit on this sport
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI just wanna hit tho√¢‚Ç¨
im probably just tired so idk what you're tryna say
Dawg its been a while since I heard this
2020 was worse
mmm kind of want to doordash something
the problem is that i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be spending money
i want to save
this is why i work at panera
Whats the point of making money if you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spend it :StareW:
I say this to myself b4 I buy dumb shit
I lost about 500 bucks last week üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
i don't spend much money in general
my dad wants me to invest in stocks tho
he wants to teach me how they work
also i want starbucks but they only use ubereats and i hate ubereats
priyanka i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drive
I mean I still made about 1000 bucks last month sooo√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
and also if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to the store i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d want to go to my friend√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s starbucks which is like 6 mikes via highway
imagine having a friend working at a restaurant
couldn't be me
i like the mango drangonfruit but i miss the valencia orange
but i also have a starbucks gift card so if i go in store i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be spending any money
i had a tall one last night
but you can't get it delivered
Honestly dude barring crazy circumstances and corruption its supposed to squeeze
Dude I made like 200 bucks bc of that one cargo ship that got stuck alone
I bought stocks in the railroad industry bc the ship got stuck üò≠üò≠üò≠
I sold a little too early tho
ok in my defense i was tired
Did you go to work today?
but my parents are like "just use our credit cards don't spend your own money"
i don't like spending my parents' money
as a result i just don't spend in general
cuz of this situation
bro my mom wants to deposit money into my checking account when i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at school and i really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want her to
i feel bad when i spend my parents' money
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had a bank acc since I was 10 in China and every year I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d put money from birthdays & etc into it
My parents do that too but I like to call it guilt money
and don't take it for granted
i just feel bad when i spend their money
except for food cuz i need it to survive :D
oh
But I still don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spend excessively or anything like that
The money√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still hard earned
yeah i just don't spend much money in general
Fair
Are you guys working on campus
idk yet
I said I wanted to
i dont think i am
And im still waiting for an email back
I want to but I'm scared of taking on more than I can handle
From 3 months ago
Yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s how I feel
I really want a job in a research lab
Yeah I understand that. I want to invest but don't know much about stocks
so I'm worried I'll lose money instead of earn
Yeah, there is risk associated with stocks since otherwise people would make nearly their entire portfolio consist of stocks, but over the long-run, the S&P 500 increases by about 6 percent a year after inflation
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m losing money by the daily here üëçüèº
Wtf
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather roll my coins myself and give it to the bank so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lose any money
yeah that's fair
better than losing 12% of the money tho
oh yeah oh shit
U still have some stuff left or?
i have a few misc items left to get still
mainly hygiene products, mini fridge, cleaning supplies etc
words can not express how thankful i am that i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to stress about paying for laundry
i also think i need to get pens still but the idea of that makes me nervous
Idk if the sale is still going on now
me: I think I must be soy intolerant. My body doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to practice soy
my brother: you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have edamamase?
me:
me: that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so dumb
unfortunately im not because my throat is a mess so i can't have anything cold and no way would my parents let me suddenly drive up to cle
columbus oh
I was there last week
our definitions of fun don't align :(
Bro it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 8 am and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 88 degrees already wtf üò≠
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fun but damn
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m burning to death under the scorching Florida sun
fair enough
the internet connection has been so bad today
Has it no shame or no money for clothes?
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten into it tbh
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been attempting bob√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s+angels for months now
Didn't know you could have a Factorio server
Maybe it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m from nyc
Oh certainly
Cuz I was driving thru it Saturday night
This ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a major big city soooo
Still
Campus is still super cool tho
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize how the hospital was gonna be
Except don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to UHüíÄ
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need one
No one told me how close the restaurants are to the dorms
I use my phone maps app
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see little Italy
everything round case can b broken down in 5min segments
I just couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find the nearest grocery store
Maybe I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t looking hard enough for it
I reccomend the bus tho, Daves is up the hill
Cuz it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s upperclassmen housing
Oh hell nah
did you lose money @ insomnia
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I saw Mitchell√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s
Maybe I did but I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop by
for some reason I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking cookies but idk why
it's insomnia cookies, there's a store on euclid
Cuz he does ofc
Bro wtf
howdy hates getting pinged
sorry Hannah, I'm going with Occam's Razor here and siding with Zhanda's explanation
it just seems more plausible
Andrej will be slain in battle against a unit of german soldiers, but his courage will not be lost in vain
what will his death accomplish?
In the meantime, Aria will die as a martyr for Persia and be admitted to heaven upon his death by US soldiers
And I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m studying
annie we are supposed to keep david in the dark smh
@drake5899925 did you recite the prayer yet

People who want to be surgeons b like
Ikr the day went so fast
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never even taken biochem
rip bio kids
gotta get these teeth yanked out me head
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting my wisdom teeth out in a week
Might screw around and find an oral surgeon in cle and get them yanked out without my parents knowing
So you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get them out?
they don't fuck up my mouth
mine are coming in okay but my oral surgeon was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbuddy these need to exit√¢‚Ç¨
my dentist told me when i was 13 that they might do it, but when i was like 16 they said "yeah, it 99% won't cause health issues"
Mine don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bother me atm knock on wood so my dentist didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t encourage me to get them out yet
Since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m young
mine don't hurt
Mine haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come in
so they're really only issues if i don't brush them properly
they were the only teeth i didn't get braces on
only 1/4 hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t started to come in but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s on its way
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
Though my dentist recently referred me to an ortho because my jaw is clicking and popping which apparently isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t normalü§°
I don't even have a regular doctor
i mean i don't either
nah my mouth isn't fucked up it's pretty normal
I'm from China but I just haven't been back in a while
why is my discord freaking out rn
someone save me
I am scared of going to the dentist
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
Rip
ouch
also hurts a FUCKTON more
because apparently they just go HAM on your teeth
But now her teeth are fine it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just that she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s missing a tooth but there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no gap for it
my aunt's friends with a dentist and I can get access to it without any reservations
They wanted to be quirky ü§§:uwu: ü§©

ah shit guess i'll work now
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been doing anything productive since may

"Title IX also requires colleges to prevent and address reported sexual harassment, in part because students who experience such conduct often find themselves struggling academically, and we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want that to happen to you.¬†"
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m considering taking 18 credits instead of 15
Maybe I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually take another class
If I do lab with my chem I would be doing 16 hours
We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want any grade slips to look bad on the school so ig we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll care about your physical and sexual wellbeing
And I have a bad heart it runs in the family üò≠üò≠
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mind me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just being smart
so I took the CSDS 132 lab for nothing
what day does class registration open again
it never opens
Bc my workload is about to fuck me in the ass üòê

New Jersey is not that bad if you pretend camden doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist
> New Jersey is not that bad if you pretend ~~camden~~ New Jersey doesn't exist
New Jersey isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad unless you pretend New York doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist

Princeton isn't one of the 3
8 applied from my school and only 3 got in

2 applied from my school and we both got in
I somehow got in idk how

My school district pays the fees for college applications for us
Let's play a game called PPSP kids who get fucking zonked during Orientation week and then cry because they think they're going to get kicked out
Does anybody actually want to go to a UC
yeah some ppl applied to 30+ idk how they did the essays
LMAO WTF
again, very college focused
i applied ED here tho
oh jesus
I come back to a college decisions convo?
damn
Dogs are snugglier tho
Dogs are opps. They work with cops
U gotta get the right dog
You gotta keep them clean
My dog broke my arm once
Cats dont üíØ
but you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not supposed to wash them that often
they are big cats tho
they smell bad naturally idk
damn
I just feel like ppl don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like cats bc they set boundaries
Having fish tho
When I was 2, my dad went for a walk in our apartment complex and this lady√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dog pushed him into a ditch and my dad broke his arm
My mom doesn't like cats so I've never had one
But its not bad
It sucks, it only got popular cuz COVID and people wanted something to watch
i laughed i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
If anyone takes me their aquarium they can have my everything
But it wasn't bad imo
He is. He got 2 metal plates and 16 screws in his left arm and we were unsuccessful in suing that bitchü§°
damn
yeah, just bc betta dishes can stay alive in certain conditions doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean you should keep them like that
Bruh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what I thought too but apparently they were just trying to make it more dramatic
He doesn't look like a fish though
Dolphins purposely do it to get high so why not I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even need a plug
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AT LEAST 10 GALLONS
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so sad
If only I be fucking like dolphins are üòî
ive read some story about a trainer who taught a dolphin to speak english, and the dolphin only learned cuz it wanted to fuck her LOL
Did I read that wrong
I'm already in horny jail as is
she did it back tho
isn't it like sharks avoid dolphins because of how aggresive they are?
Idk y
No I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s McAfee if it was him I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d know it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s him
what the hell is wrong with dolphins- poor sharks
Dolphins are jerks and they fuck whatever they can find
So I'm not reading it wrong
wtf
RIP and good riddance
My theory is that the smartest animals are the worst ones
They literally will bite off the head of a small fish and fuck that
Not the head the body
That thing will maul you to death faster than you can ever react
oh to be an egg stealing gay penguin
u on the same chemicals which turned the friggin frogs gay?
Me and my friends went to sea world a month ago thinking Shamu was still alive
oh shit there used to be a seaworld around where i live long long ago
Sea world mistreats their whales and other animal so much- it's really sad
I think that's what scared me the most
Gia step away from the penguin
The owners don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening with the mistreatment and everything so they purposely make everything look bad so it would attract less people and gradually lose business and close
@chandachan yo mama so fat she hosted a whole seaworld inside her
If down bad was a person...
Aw stingray
Her eyeballs fucking terrify me
you really had to do that
gonna cry
One day I'm gonna lose it and just go on a fish rant
I kinda want to fight a penguin
She said I need a hobby
duck evolution is scary
Damn
Can't appreciate the whale knowledge
Same shit dawg
When they fuck
Wtf major even are you
female ducks didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be forced on
I didn't even realize that Laila's pfp was a duck
Poor duckies
I also spent a good amount of our relationship talking to my ex about the Cambrian explosion, ancient history, etc. i think now I get why she broke up with me
Laila I'm not smart, seeing i s hard
Also wrong
I'm short, you probably will my friend
evolution is changes in Allele frequency within a population that happen to be advantageous over multiple generations
I'm also kinda short 
But that never came from me, okay?
I will never admit that again 
Because I'm 7ft tall
and if we found the wings really hot
damn bro your wings are hot
Could happen over a very long time though
Also we'd lose use of our fingers
well wings doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean we can fly
Oh what a disaster that would be
left foot
Icarus is a fucking idiot
Cuz he fell to his death
And I'm gonna find out who
Oh my 
I feel threatened
I feel so bad for you
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s female and male country
Thats considered country? I only know hurt üò≠
That can't be true. Beethoven spring sonata and Levitating. try to prove it
Idk
Hurt

I wanted to call my room cam ranch
but I thought of it too late
I need cam ranch in my life
I need ranch in my life
I never realized how good tjat shit was
Back in high school I used to suck on his dick
Until I stopped putting it on salad and started dipping pizza in it
i wont dip pizza in ranch
I've actually never tried ranch with  wings
U guys missed dishwasher salmon?
Uh oh
We need to have a vibe session khiar üòå

I want to go to Ireland so bad but my friends refuse to
Harsh but fair

haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we explored more space than ocean
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t breathe in either
idk the exact logistics
idk about humanoid aliens tho
Us being the only life in the universe seems very unlikely
But I dont see the big deal about ppl freaking out over ufos. I understand but like.. wtf they gon do?
apparently probe our buttholes
They prolly dont wanna be near our funky asses either
oh jeez what is that
ocean kinda scary ngl
ocean super scary
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it when there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s water under my feet
i hate docks and boats
Ocean is supa scary
Did you know that that fish isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t supposed to look like that
blobfish is so sad

Wait gia that's sad : (
Hammerhead shark seems like it would def be racist
Damn
There's a whole family of Whitefish
The fuck
Zachs just trying to figure out which fish he shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be friends with anymore cmon
chihuahuas aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t racist bc they hate everyone
and i was wondering
Oh-
what happened to them
what is this supposed to say about me @toomanyzs
u calling me annoying and small?
i just feel like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s possible that if victims had pets
bad stuff could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve happened to them
This turned from a fish conversation to a Zach roast
very close to shinkicker
Most catostomids aren't
If you give pigs a dead body they will eat it
I fucking hate catostomids
They look weird as fuck

No legit 3ammee gets defensive üò≠ and then if I take it without arguing I feel weird
No legit they do that shit üò≠üò≠ one time he shoved that shit in my pocket I said o wow
You gotta pretend like you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want it and then take it üëçüèº
Dude its even worse with paying for dinner or food omg

And her older sister got soo mad
On some "thats so fucking disrespectful dont ever do that shit again"
Idgaf i will shove my card in the card reader ur not paying for shit
Dude then they start swearing on their family and shit
They swear to never talk to u again if u don't let them pay
I dont blame u we inherited that attitude üíÄ
But if the friends aren't close then idk. But if ur family or a close friend then its all love idgaf about paying
My dad gets so mad when my friends√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ dad offers to payüò≠
Too bad the man√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been gone for 5 years :Sadge:

because you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t busy from like 2 on
On the weekend its ok tho

3 hrs only? They won't let u stay?
because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a longer shift but i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get a break and i usually get a break like 3 hours into my 8

I am in pain :pepege:

I was told this is where I find jobs
oh
And I need the money :StareW:
handshake is near useless, we spent months trying to find jobs on it last year
Pain
the best way is to talk to uperclassmen, and email ppl who are where u want to work
if you want to continue with handshake, go for it, but its not exactly super useful
what would we do without you Howdy
Rip
The fuck is animal liposuction
No offence to that industry but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine studying medicine to become a plastic surgeon I just personally could never do it

A lot of people seek is because they want to feel better about themselves
i woould never do it but :shrug:
Fair
And shit

A conflict that could've been avoided if European colonialism in Africa didn't occur
And fucked shit up
And left
Right. The colonizers leave the region a mess and act like the current mess isn't their fault
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m clearly already an expert ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏

There's a different one I can't find on youtube that I'm in though
I will once again be working at the tolbert lab
I'd really be impressed if you could grab the MAC address of my computer
Oh no if somebody stole my identity and paid all 48 thousand dollars of my student debt that'd be awwwwfuuullllll
ap scores in 6 hours
someone talk to me i am bored :CB_pepeshy:
ive never been to chipotle
Rice takes up valuable room
i dont think there's one close to me
Fire. I never tried the sour cream tho
Never been to one there's none here
i work at one so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my main source of food
Never been. That place looks depressing af
I used to work at walmart but I quit early July
Bro I hate Walmart
Jen it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ok to have wrong opinions
Idk which fast food is the best
Chipotle slaps when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m extra hungry
The products√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ quality aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that great and the customer service at my local Walmart is ass
Though there was one employee there who was super duper old and had to use a machine to be able to project a voice (dunno what it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called) and I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen him in a whileüíÄ
Oh Meijer is goated too
Dawg cuz its fucking cheap
And the product quality isn't bad
Nah their products ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t good
They sell the same shit as every other store
Produce is bad for sure but its pretty much like that in every big grocery store
anecdotal evidence but the few things ive bought from walmart have all broken
probably just cause they were cheap tho
Never buy school supplies from thereüíÄ
LMFAO im not gonna defend them im off the clock but damn its not that bad üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
was def cheap tho
Walmart is our last resort for everything lol
Fuck them üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
like they tell us to get the sale at all costs but at some point i feel bad for the customer and be like "go somewhere else you'll save tons of money"
in case my boss is on here i mostly don't do that though
They tried to get us to get ppl to sign up for the credit card
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really drive people away from Panera lol
is it just me or does every large-ish company have a credit card that it wants you to sell to people
Credit card or a rewards account?
And the card isn't bad
U sign up online its pretty simple but the card gives u rewards, I forgot what benefits there were
I forgot
anyone have funny terrible customer stories
A lady straight up said she won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tip us employees just for doing our job while I was ringing up her order
Dunno if that counts
some people are really awful
like i get you're upset but it's not actually my fault
She either was a horrible person or was having a rough day or both
Literally the worst thing about every company is mf corporate
Because they do stupid shit
One time this lady wanted to return luggage that was BEAT TF up. And she had no receipt. Nothing. And there was no proof she actually bought it from us we even tried searching on the purchase history we couldn't find it
And she was so mad
She cussed tf outta my manager on some "u dont work here" like what??
Like damn what I do???
at my store the manager is often so busy that by the time they arrive the customer has cooled off and left tho
i mean tbh i feel that
cashier is the worst job ever
I was tired and wanted to go home since I hate hardware stores
why do u hate hardware stores
i work at home depot and have never heard the home depot ad music
The thing is if u make a mistake on register and the customer pays, there's nothing we can do, only customer service can refund
Its annoying asf
I cannot imagine working at Home Depot
Both parties lose essentially
u get to solve peoples problems, kinda
Fair
The smell of√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ dirt? Idk
Most I can do for a house is clean itüíÄ
Mechanical skills-wise the most I can do is jump start a car
jump starting and tire changing are essential if u have a car
I forgot how to change a car√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tire
But if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stranded I can jump start it if I find another car
But forgot most of them
my dad used me for cheap labor as a kid
They can do god√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s work and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get paid enough
Yeah but many people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna pay so much for a contracting job
yeah, i think the key is to be able to build a small company
ok well i should have gone to bed 2 and a half hours ago
The interesting thing is, the more I get into cars, the more I understand how to work with shit on cars, and the better I get at working on the ones we've got, cuz motivation LOL
The important maintenance tasks include changing oil and replacing filter, changing tires, replacing bulbs, and even replacing brake pads, which is esp important for driving crazy LOL
Jumping the car is also a useful skill for emergencies
POV: you ate an apple
Yeah they are very helpful skills to have, these tasks are what one should be able to do without a mechanic
For the same reason, I've been able to develop a finer understanding of my own body as I got stronger in the gym, so that I can better manage my own health and fitness, and effectively move around heavier weights
not eating an apple these next 4 years; that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bad manifestation
idk, the shop I went to to get the brakes and muffler fixed had a mechanic do a checkup, then show me what the issues were and an estimate of the repair cost and time, and then asked me whether I wanted them to go thru with it
I paid them after the job was done, and they provided a 1 yr warranty on the repair work
while also leaving more complex repair work to a mechanic
the past owners of my car used the spare so i have no spare
no u think i have cash money
Well this is awkward isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t itüò≥
Some of them aren't equipped with full size tires, and they're shit
Donuts are only rated up to 50 mph, so they're only for taking the car to the nearest repair shop to get the flat fixed
Oh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t blame you. I hate them too. Rarely go into my mom√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s job haha
shoot no one told me about bubbling in school code during ap exams
i really dont wanna give any more money to collegeboard
Sad
More deeply disturbing than sad imo
What kind of sick fuck does this shit
Pissed*
Dude imma rlly die plz
apparently if you bubbled in the school code while testing you could get the scores for those tests sent for free
oh, dang :/
Mf knew what he did and hid it for 4 years and has the audacity to cry when he hears his sentence?
@kourou_ I did Calc 1 and 2 via ccp, got the top grade in my class, and still got a 2
my dad just came into my room and handed me a capri sun
No masks for vaccy people except for in gyms, saferides, or patient care
And then if we all don't have delta variant no masky
And gyms are still open to off campus people
Cuz covid isn't real
@toomanyzs RIP cooper tulloch
I didn't actually know him but it is very sad
Our lives are too short...
I already have problems breathing as is bc of caffeine and I gotta wear a mask in the gym :Sadge:
I feel like this rn
I would never be anime
So what percentage turned their shit in
After the announcement came, 860 people turned their cards in in like 3 days
Damn 860! üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Idk if you guys got this email
They're deadass saying keep your virusy ass outta here if you ain't vaccy
And they're saying if you're an antivaxxer and don't mask and test they will fire your ass
Tried my best
how do you even end up in horny jail
aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you in a relationship
the only reason I framed it that way with the skulls and shit is to prove I ain't worthy of horny jail
bring in a relationship is like the horniest thing ever sorry
*oh*
one must always strive to get into a relationship, yet never attain it
I'm a pure child of god I've never kissed a girl
she doesn't for me :(

Wasn't Ohio red :StareW:

I look for solutions to tech problems I run into
only a few more weeks
until college

nobel says thats the wrong choice correct
because that's one of the rare things I'll miss about home
yo i want to go hiking
if i planned my trip better we probably could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve stopped there but
who wants to be a granola girl with me! üòÅ
Have you seen how many people go missing every year from hiking?
kinda wanna start packing today kinda don't
and she still hasn't
I could never
unless it's someone who pissed me off by direct rudeness on their end
tho i can be confidently slightly passive aggressive nowadays
but i feel bad right after
they invoiced me a negative number last year too
the college owes me instead of vice versa
i apparently paid more than what i owed
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to start packing on saturday i think
tbh seeing that the college owes me made me feel pretty cash money
is it true that we don't have pillows and have to buy them ourselves?
why would i want a college pillow used by years of other people
i don't wanna sleep on a college's pillow anyway
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they do
reminds me of when someone said they were bringing their own bedding
that's what we had in my last dorm situation
SAME HAHA tho idk if i'll keep it
which is noice cuz i had terrible allergies this summer
one's a body pillow tho so...
oh
oh rly
but i know i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need them
i sleep with a bad quality down alternative pillow underneath a better quality shredded foam one
and feel ur foot dangling off the edge
no cuz im not tall
ngl i will miss having room on my bed
sigh
i just want extra room
I need an Alaskan king bed tbh anything else is too small
i don't think i require a king bed
idk if i wanna decorate my room
oh

The frames don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit my big ass head :Sadge:
I want lasic
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna wear glasses no mo
gib money
D: damn
so i won't get lasik
My mom got it done when I was like three and she couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see for a week straight
would rather wear glasses forever
I look so weird without glasses
my glasses don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit my nose and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kind of embarrassing
The only reason I want to get off glasses is because I wanna wear sunglasses :LAUGHING:
I tried
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put them on
Lost that battle and cried like a little bitch for a day
contacts dry my eyes sigh but i still wear them
not that much during covid tho
yeah i didn't like that
Idk why but I look like a douche bag with sunglasses
i used to drink carrot juice every day cuz my eyesight was deteriorating fast growing up
dunno if that helped
I'm so sorry my friend
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all been just pain from that point on
i didnt start until i was almost 14
damn
my mom never had glasses and my dad first got them in college and my sister and i had bad eyes since we were little ü§°
my mom√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s family doesnt wear glasses
I got the bad genes from both my parents√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ sides dawg üò≠
Near
near
my curly hair that i still don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take care of and therefore is a mess ü•∞ü•∞
My dad gave me a slightly deformed finger and weird ass limbs
farsightedness doesn't lol
idk who I got it from
apparently i look a LOT like my dad's mom
Idk how
Probably got that from his dad as well
i think i got my height genes from my dad's side cuz they're tall
They all hella short
oh i got my hair from my dad fs
oh
dad tall mum short
Yet ironically my dad is 5 7 and mom 5 0
Dad short and mom short
my mom wishes i was 5'7 and im like WOMAN HAVE YOU SEEN YOURSELF FIRST üò≠
how could she expect me to be 5'7 I DONT GOT TALL PARENTS
i had a friend who has a very tall father and a very short mother and growing up people were always like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìshe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going to be so tall√¢‚Ç¨ and she ended up like 5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢4
damn if i wore 6-inch heels i'd be 5'11
I did half a Xan 13 hrs til I land√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ ü•≤
damn
whats funnier is that my mom would wear 3 or 4-inch heels and i'd still tower over her
One good thing is I am no longer intimidated by my parents as they have to raise their heads when they speak to me
my sister is almost my height it's scary
like damn this girl was half my height now look
u ever have those nights of trying to do math workbooks at 10:30pm
terrible terrible terrible
elementary school ptsd
Late bloomer tings tbh. I'm 18 and my growth plates are still wide open

_mom please I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired_
once i was at the library and saw an indian dad with his son and he slapped his kid for getting a question wrong
pain
I was so confused when my phone keeps autocorrecting the world colour
felt bad for the kid ngl
Then I realized I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in america
fuck outta here
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHates the French√¢‚Ç¨
"feels the urge to civilize people who ain't white"
getting slapped by your parents in public was so humiliating
NO CUZ JAI SHRI KRISHNA
sorry y'all but there is only one god
Damn I was gonna say Bob:bob:
oH
shoot its 9 pm i need to wash my hair today ughhhh
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it everyday?
no cuz i have longer hair
you're not supposed to wash your hair everyday if it's longer
idk how long lmfao
bro idk the exact length üò≠
not long anymore ;0
my hair was curlier when i wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taking as good care of it how is that fair
i aint no SIMP
Mine is just long enough to touch my shoulders
my hair used to be long and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how
i don't like shoulder-length hair it doesn't suit my face
and then suddenly it was short again
prob cuz you cut it woahhhhh
oo I kinda want an undercut
but i want my hair long rn
I just wolfed my hair and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very annoying that I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tie it back
/I also cut my own hair/
My mom hates my long hair
And so when they said I'm 6'2 I was like wtf
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exit out of this chat
Go to the top left menu, click the down arrow, and select "Exit the Server"
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so close to using a 3 in 1 instead of bodywash

I chose cwru so I could literally leave my hometown
Didn't apply to enough schools outside but this school is great so I'm grateful whatever
Fair enough
I really dont blame u jenin
Don't unsend
Leaving your hometown gang rise up
i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve chosen a college in my state over cwru but yknow
they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me in
i just don't wanna ride fords everyday
I dont blame u. Rta is better
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know middlebury was in vermont until the vermont rumor
OSU was way too big for me and hs 2.0 so I was like I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going here
I wanted to go to California but it was too expensive
My English teacher went there
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to Kenyon though
when i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into a certain other college in ohio, my friend asked me if i really wanted to go to school in ohio. i said no. now here i am
funniest thing is when u get a rubber bullet on your butt and get sit on the toilet cuz of the bruise
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t choose ohio; ohio chooses you
I wanted to leave Ohio and here I am
Everyone I know that tried to leave Ohio
UF didn't want me cuz I'm not white :Sadge:
Ended up in
I almost ended up going to Boston or NYC but nope! Stayed in Ohio!
The goal of going to college at case is to leave Ohio
Lol when i was applying to college i expected to get into a t30 with my indicated major as "comp sci" and ive never taken a comp sci class in my life, im surprised i even got into case western :ohmy:
They fail to achieve the goal
geographic college
at one point i wanted to go to school in connecticut üòÉ

Applied to one school there just because of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìeAsT cOaSt√¢‚Ç¨ smh

Dude i always wanted to try southern seafood

Not to be southphobic but I hate the south
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not wrong
all the cals in louisiana seafood makes us fat
Did anyone omit their SAT score when applying this year
cleveland bad
cwru campus pog tho
I'm pretty disappointed when I read this chat sometimes, not going to lie.
don't these happen everywhere tho? just don't walk alone at night
I like walking alone at night tho :Sadge:
i dont like walking alone at night i usually walk with my friends
sad
very sad
walking alone at night>>>>>>>>>>>>
personally I like it but it's such a shame that it's so dangerous for some people
No, I was telling him about how I'm hopeful people will lean into Cleveland and the area here as opportunities come back, because I'm really sick and tired of "Cleveland bad, too poor, only shootings, etc" and I hoped you guys would have stopped that narrative, and I really hope that this turns around
Oh shit 2024 and 2025
Fuck that took me too long
dude i didnt even know until u just said it
Oh jeninüò≠
Ur right. I argue with my friends from out of state about this shit too. They have the same perspective
i'm not on campus anymore T_T

üò≠ sorry finals was approaching fast

Last time I saw Zhanda was on Halloween

last time i saw zhanda
was
anjali, ANJALI WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME NANI THE MOO
I'm probably gonna do like the 20th idk
A lot of it is based in prejudice and misunderstanding of the evolution of the peripheral cleveland neighborhoods. There's some really awesome areas, and there really is a lot to do, but people just refuse to make any effort unless opportunities are thrust in front of their face. A lot of these kids from rich suburbs who had literally everything handed to them are like "ewwww lower class people" and think it's just like the absolute worst.
Make sure y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t die when you start college
I wish I could but I can't üò¶
Also I am as of today no longer tasked with bonking people for covid rules
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll def be doing stuff for OL things on my bday sadly
damn
Oh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s such a mood
even worse
*no ACs*
Yeah I have to wake up earlyü•≤

Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t relateüòé
I have not had sunscreen on me for like half a decade now I cant stand how that thing feels on my skin
i don't use sunscreen either
Ive never gotten a sunburn either
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear sunscreen unless I know for a fact I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be outside for 1-several hours at a stretch
If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m outside for 5 minutes I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear sunscreen
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use sunscreen, I just burn and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learn my lesson
Sunburn is so bad for you
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when my throwing practice is and I cant be throwing shit with slippery ass hands:pepe_knife_stab:
Don't discus throwers use talcum powder?

No you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t√¢‚Ñ¢¬•√Ø¬∏
I just have AirPods now since my dad kinda wrecked my beats headphones
My old pair√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s battery went to shit though
Every time I drop my AirPods I die a little inside
also u can get them at like every airport
damn true
didnt they just come out with a new phone tho like how long until the next one
maybe that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count
the 13 should be coming out this august/september tho
the 12 was last september/august *i think*
Sennheiser is also known for good earbuds but ugh idk if i want $150+ earbuds
wtf
something id find in a fever dream
They feel nice tho
If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going for audio quality I suggest getting wired ones but if not then wireless if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want tangled wires everytime you use them :pepege:
Still would buy AirPods over those
"Apple's iPhone 13 launch date will be September 2021"
I bought airpods but never ended up using them üòÇ
and they're still sealed on my desk...
Shit I still need to decide if I wanna buy a new laptop or not
i bought a laptop, should be coming on monday :))
Isn't there one coming out this Fall?
I thought it already came out?
imma get my shitty macbook air to campus
Ok so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not out yet is what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hearing?
Ik how you feel
My sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Air is ass compared to my Pro
I had a school-issued macbook air from 8th grade to my senior year and the battery was so bad
Granted she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take good care of her electronics but still
The battery life wouldn't last more than 3 hours; however, that had to do more with the battery than the actual laptop...
My laptop√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s battery may or may not have gone bad idk
Oh geez
Yup, and I was too lazy to get it replaced since I figured school was almost over and I would return my laptop to them
Never owned one but figured it could be useful
Last year I got my iPad and AirPods ~~that my sister won lol~~
I'm thinking of getting an iPad for college
I'm still not sure how I want to take notes
idk if i want to use notebooks or an ipad to take notes :sadge:
Same and it's so hard to keep track of everything
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even search for key words on physical notebooksüò≠üò≠üò≠
But the difficulty arises when you have no space left...
im just nervous i wont retain as much as when i write on regular paper
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all about the physical act of writing, which you will still do on an iPad
I sometimes miss paper and pencil though
Had 80 pages of chem 106√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s notes and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even notice it since they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re on GoodNotes lol
Yah, now it's the exact opposite: it's hard to write on paper since I always write on the iPad
I can still do both but who knows how long that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll lastüíÄ
my mom said i shouldnt get one üíÄ
idk what comfortable with
@legendsexile I was unsure about getting an iPad before freshman year too, so I just decided to see how first semester went. Realized I used a LOT of paper hence I decided to make the switch
i have to buy a new iphone, apple watch, airpods and macbook when i come to campus
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still taking notes by hand regardless√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
I forgot I applied to work at Apple LMAOOOOO
Shit
IM LEAVING SOON THOOOOO
i got rejected within 12 hours of applying yesterday
fml
Damn it Apple WHY DIDNT YOU OFFER ME AN INTERVIEW BACK WHEN I APPLIED ALSBSOSBDISNSBSSNSBKSBDSKNSHDKSSJSBSJNDVSJSBCIDNSJSJS
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually really mad rn
But I wish it was earlier
Is there an Apple store near Case?
sorry dude but you haven't met gogo
I didnt think beans would get u mad üòî
oh I thought you meant the kill bill character for some reason
lmao he forgot to drop the album
Didnt think he'd be on his album
i missed the livestream
damn
wtf
oml i want to say this out loud
I dont need forgiveness from gold
Raunak stop being fucking blasphemous
Racist fuck
i forgot the second hal
brb gonna find another one
Raunak r u trying to silence arab voices
oh shit i think it'll actually haunt me
DAWG is that what it means i can't read it üò≠
Don't be discriminatory
oh lemme find that vid
Nothing im being racist
brhu i can't find that viid
So fucking racist
i never get bored of watching this vid
Jenin can u delete my shit
need to delete the troll texts
Don't fucking tell me what to do
google translate doesn't work then :LAUGHING:
imagine roasting someone in a language they don't know
Bruh why are all the discover Cleveland options all gone
All that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s left is Discover Israel
shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have hesitated
Do y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all think Discover Israel is the only option left because of recent events
like not a lot of people signed up for Discover Israel because they want to distance themselves from the country?
Wtf
I really have nothing against the activity it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just not for me
I attended a Jewish tennis camp in Pittsburgh 10 years ago though
Makes me wish us Chinese have even half the propaganda power as the zionists
They absolutely suck at media
Even the Russians, the damn Russians, r better at it
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand how
Probably would not want to associate with Israel given the current circumstances
plus the fact that it sounded boring as hell
sorry
i looked into it because i was hoping it would be like √¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏explore jewish culture in cleveland √¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏||and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m generally trying to connect more with that part of my existence|| but nope it was just √¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏we sit on campus√¢‚Ç¨¬º√Ø¬∏
To be fair doing Jewish culture things probably shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be something negative, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re supporting Netanyahu by going to discover Israel
Fuck politics
Fuck politics, go hit the gym
Not doing work? :StareW:
ew work
hoedy get off you phone
u have techs to fix
i didnt walk
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have their emails
why would i b on my phone?
it is not my destiny to work in this dunkin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ donuts until i drop dead
China absolutely does not suck at media
in-country propaganda is really really effective
*wait, doesnt moses live in china tho*
As for output there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not much
In country propaganda is so good my parents live in the US for 2 decades and they still like China
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I live in Hong Kong
No it's just hard to explain
and make sure i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get 2 hours in the week i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have left (as wisdom teeth out on monday so im not working next week)
If u haven't lived in mainland China since the early 2010s
Not a bad way to put it
i mean, no need to make it worse üëÄ
~~ok study timw yeet~~
OH SHIT IT'S 2
@speedbirdconcorde2 i feel like you would be helpful
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i can say it here (?) because i think it pushes the rules but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very confused
idk
by √¢‚Ç¨≈ìupperclassman√¢‚Ç¨ i meant someone who isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a 2025. sorry
i failed ap physics 2 exam
Well, i didnt take any ap classes, so ur a mega brain for getting like 2 lvls deep
jk u didn't see me
im still so mad that i wasnt invited to 123 just bc i didnt take the test >>>>>>:C
rip moses
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know why they invited me legitimately
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re confusing me with what gets creditüò≠Like I thought I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to do the intro physics courses but now they invite me to the other intro one
i assume you won't feel anything on your wrist?
i hate mechanics im literally majoring in physics so that i can do something other than mechanics
cuz no resistance?
it will eventually slow down i assume
NO you IDIOT it's a VACUUM you FUCKING DISGRACE
i never ignore air resistance sorry
there is no air in a vacuum you buffoon
assume my body is a motionless frictionless fixed pole that does not require air to breathe what would be my moment of inertia if you picked me up by the ankles and swung me like a discus
moses buddy why are you awake
packing
no i didn't üò≠
i tried
oh theres a restaurant in pittsburgh that was featured on kitchen nightmares
i miss pittsburgh
wtf
like they did not keep their space clean
cuz the ethnicity is the same
I LEGIT THOUGHT THAT LAST BIG ONE WAS A VAT
Dude they invited me too and I haven't taken physics since 9th grade üíÄüíÄ
dead
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know 9th grade physicsüò≠
It just simply doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make sense
Actually I really liked It eventually. I just hated it bc I almost didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t become valedictorian bc of it
Damn y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all taken physics?
omg
I don't remember if he had a phd but I seem to remember it said Professor Michael Martens, PhD
sad :(
I think I need to take phys 122 for my degree
David I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even help my sister with 9th grade physics @_frostyyyyy_
Oh
We were doing practice problems
And my answers were wrongüò≠
the fuck do you mean do I like peanut brittle
Oh
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be meüòé
I have developed pollen allergies and so far they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve peaked this yearüòé
Actually it depends on how bad the allergy is
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d fuck a bme premed!
would they fuck you is the question :cutethonk:
now now, maybe they wouldn't fuck *anyone*
@ Dayruin#0150 (don't wanna ping them)
I dunno. are there any BME premed students who have been spotted socializing?
*never*
I think that if I went for computer engineering like I wanted to, I'd be dead before fall 2022
**is he though**
a friend of mine started as bme
~~she changed dw~~ a superior of hers at work talked about how hardly any classes in BME overlap with premed classes
What the fuck is BME
if my social life at CWRU goes down the drain by the end of this fall, I'm taking electrical engineering
and I am never to be spotted again
yes cuz we're killing it
Trynna kill 2 birds w 1 stone
one of my friends is pre law and wants to go into environmental law one day
but can't attend law school and med school simultaneously tho
Then dont üò≠üò≠üò≠
Doctors alone have to make sacrifices for their career how u gon do law too
pre law doesn't have specific courses. you just take the lsat and pray you get in
~~im considering law school once i have started my career as a doc tho~~
I mean does it matter bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m studying Biology as a major and environmental & anthropology as a minor so if I decide to do pre med does it rlly change anything
Thats not bad
my friend is gonna be a poli sci pre law this fall (not at cwru tho)
chem classes
and certain math classes
I mean I have to take chem and the math classes either way
then law school
what if u love someone poor
then i love someone poor
If I actually fall in love with someone poor then shit ig I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m marrying poor
in all realness i couldn't give a flying crap about whether or not my bf/husband comes from a rich family
plan c: marry someone poor and help them become rich
aren't i so prepared
Dawg that Jeff bezos song is stuck in my head

u'll miss out if u ask them
"i hAtE dawAlI"
pain
don't @me
_I already haven't had any breakfast in 4 months_
thats literally not healthy. also no matter when your first meal of the day occurs, it's still breakfast cuz you're breaking your fast. so you actually never skip breakfast unless you *never* eat
i still miss my penini/wrap that i ate
damn imagine eating regularly
2 meals a day and I hate any forms of snacks üòê
i don't hate snacks im just simply not inclined to snack cuz my stomach doesn't demand it
I hate potato chips and candy in particular
Feeling good
i mean i don't have a sweet tooth but i don't hate sweets
one thing for sure: one meal/day is not good
and having chips as that meal is even worse
coffee worse aleijdwalejd
i read how it's drying for your stomach if you drink coffee on an empty stomach üíÄ
I need to store as much fat as I can to prepare for the harsh Ohioan winter
I dont do this
i just eat however much my stomach demands
~~this convo is making me lose my appetite, it usually does the opposite~~
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink soda either but junk food tho>>>>
lmaoooooooo i just had biryani so i feel nothing
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t track my food
I eat 2 whole large pizzas for a meal when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on my bulk I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think you understand how hard it is for me to not eat junk food:NM_PeepoEatGrapes:
I can't drink soda
I just don't like it
I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve starved to death by then
u have classes tho
~~since school is routine basis~~
oh ic
Nah dumping 700 mg of caffeine in me on an empty stomach energizes anyone more than food
Unless you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna just crash after 4 pm
In which case don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had proper Chinese breakfast in 3 years and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stuck with mf scrambled eggs :Sadge:
that is actually really damaging to your stomach
~~and here i thought 10 months was bad~~
DON'T U DARE MESS WITH OLIVES
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat olives
I'm sorry u can revoke my palestinian card but I dont fuck with olives
i didn't know that
Actually, I've never had those
If you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat rare steak you missing out
~~sorry priyanka~~
nah im not missing out
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eaten those in a long time
Something simple, Chinese people don't eat anything too fancy
Ik his rich ass eating fancy shit
Maqloubeh isn't fancy
If you haven't tried 7mar meat you missing out
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I cook once and make a shit ton of food for the whole week
U right i forgot
death
eggplant is the worst to fry
No cauliflower tho
Idk my tastebuds are altered
u need tastebuds replacement
No jenin I never liked warak
Lmaooooo it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just bc growing up my mom shoved vegetables in everything we ate
Ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a single meat dish where it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just meat
ur missing out
Lmaooo never tried it but it sounds nasty üò≠
Stuffed zucchini is fire tho
never tried that
tried it once
Y'ALL ARE MISSING OUT IF U HAVEN'T HAD STUFFED CARROTS
~~they're hard to make tho~~
Yousef girls don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fart it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s obv a joke
~~except u build it inside~~
Jenin if I drill a hole in a fruit or vegetable it ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gon be for eating :StareW:
Oh my gosh...
To fuck
again, i've been coding the whole day
She needed some help I'm sorry :((((
shall i continue to kid myself that i'm studying or actually study
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been kidding myself that some poor family doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need their documents translated so√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ yes keep on kidding
~~i think my brain is too dead to carry out this conversation, sorry~~
thats annoying
bro don't omg
we got even more fucked in his online exams thats for sure
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you cheat :StareW:
nope
Still could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve cheated :StareW:
you don't know the pain of typing out chemistry work and formulas
this is college
It was a pain to type out the lewis dot structure shit
if you get caught cheating kiss your rep and possibly your education goodbye
"yea will do arts and sciences to avoid chem"
and then
idk why i still took
I got a 2/7 on my chem midterm bc it was full of electro chem shit :pepege:
sorry anything chem is hard for me
Well same I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a bio person I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like chem
tho
Actually wtf am I doing with science all together I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a history person:StareW:
*never*
I feel like chem is one of the most despised sciences
if we're talking about what type of people we are ~~idk~~
But I had a really shitty teacher in hs that hated me
Before I was a natural history typa person bc my dad used to almost never be home when I was a kid and when he was he would take me to a natural history museum/planetarium
our school didn't offer gcse history ü§û
it is but i hate physics more than chem
i dont make the rules
PHYSICS DOESNT MAKE SENSE
everyone hates on physics√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
I would always go watch this one cambrian documentary with him and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d always fall asleep bc he was sleep deprived :NM_PeepoCryDrink:
Physics is just applied math
you are a horrible human being
its rigid like math
yeah but physics is boring
thats where you're wrong
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re boring
you're clearly doing the wrong physics
Physics is applied math, chemistry is applied physics, biology is applied chemistry
And math is just applied philosophy
~~it's ok, i'm always wrong ik~~
i may just be biased as my dad was a particle physicist before he was an economist so i've seen some cool shit but physics fuckin' slaps
Shh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tryna make it work
I like philosophy but I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taking a class on it heard it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super biased
No guys don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t criticize me it works if u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think about it
idk about bias but i agree with not taking a class on it :LAUGHING:
yeah, I tried to teach myself some of the stuff in my dads old textbooks and realized i couldn't do chunky multivariable calculus
omg i wanna say something but idk if i should
oh shit moment of realization: i enjoyed studying
I am scared of multivariable calculus
Yes some ppl hate physics and some love it√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ BUT HAVE YOU MET ANYONE THAT HATES BIOLOGY?????
u saying this makes me feel that i'll take it personally :eyes2:
I kinda hate biology
I wasn't a huge fan, but I wouldn't say I hate it
i mean idt its too personal? idk?
Damn y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all hanging around bad crowds
anything bigger just kinda boring
i hate biology when it comes to genetics
HAVE YOU MET ANYONE THAT HATES ASTRONOMY????????
i was so scared of genetics tho
Fucking stars :NM_Kekw:
wtf why
astronomy boring
~~i forgot what this shiz even was~~
Ok but if you hate history tho you're clinically insane
Yes astronomy is boring
~~sorry, i'm high and i've been coding~~
i hate u
~~i don't see where that'd be offensive~~
all we did was study the textbook :D
and ran electrophoresis plates to prove that we modified DNA
I still prefer EE though
yep i forgot it
THE NEXT LEVEL OF PUNNET SQUARES SUCKS THO
I SHOULD BE WORKING GAHHHH
~~i just like to see that someone else is working~~
I be revising some poor sap's work knowing damn well he spent a shit ton of thoughts on this and imma just send it back at least twice :KEKW:
not me being worried about phys 122
oh raunak is woke
oh it is hell driving in india
Bc he ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t no simp
i didn't
~~actually i'm too tired now, does tmw morning my time work for u?~~
at least one member of your family understands the truth tho
chem>physics i will die on this hill
~~idk~~
~~i can already see this is bad, what would it be like if i see it when im awake~~
~~oh, doesn't this make sense either/?~~
~~for me it doesn't but i just may be smol brain~~
me staying focused on my work was nice tho
hmmm im still wide awake i should continue working
oh mb, huge
jenin you have no idea about the dumbest shit ive done üò≠
she is not wtf
cuz you know im right
my answer will be biased cuz i hate chem
you can't tell me what i can say and what i can't
too late she told you
cuz ik we'll have the same opinion
i cant
me but laptop
who says i haven't already met her?
u don't know cuz u were nocturnal with est
you're slow
I was never a fan of Panda Express
~~idk~~
omg last time i had panda express was in fresno
Last time I had it was probably 5 years ago
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the hype at all
Sadly there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t enough Chinese-run restaurants here :((((
Aww
I would like a word with whoever the fuck came up with orange chicken
I never really liked orange chicken tbh
I ate there for the first time in forever last week
I've never been to a pf chang restaurant :0 
I've always wanted to go
It's tradition every time I come over I'd eat at a PF chang's at the detroit airport
But what the fuck is crab rangoon
or whatever the fuck those wonton looking things are called
Crab rangoon isn't too bad
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never had crab idt
Chinese people don't cook with fucking cream cheese
I miss it
tbf like half of the Chinese food I love you prolly can't even get the ingredients here
very humid tho
Yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like tropical places
yeah I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear glasses outside
I already feel bad for eating meat I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine going to a slaughter houseüò≠üò≠
My grandparents were farmers and my grandpa taught me how to prep any live stock except cow :StareW:
They were poor farmers
they didn't have cows
I haven't had 4 seasons since I lived in Georgia and Illinois üò≠
Never had it
Idk if it was their entire family but someone on that side has a farm
3 minutes til I return to worküò≠
Why do americans rarely eat the organs tho :Sadge:
I forgot this is how doja got famous crazy üò≠

Idk wallah he seems funny

I'm tired of these old fucks being politicians
Ur about to die

Sorry
My brain is fried yet again so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not in the position to judge
Zeit w za3tar will fix the problem
Here goes another 3% 
I think my phone battery is a representation of my life force
Cuz I always need sleep
Rip grammar
hi i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go to work today
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have work
I feel that should be coming up soon right?
I was in the send off but I left when breakout rooms started
I never even heard of it lol
TRUE
the more the merrier tho
I checked and I did get emails about it last year when I was a freshman but I just ignored it
I personally felt like the summer stuff and orientation didn't help me that much
My orientation group stopped talking immediately after Discover Week
maybe it helps ppl be less scared of making friends
My flight is in exactly 12 hours
Oh that major fair is also super fun
I need the cash :StareW:
I believe you need to have a work visa appended on
I got an email in my account back in October _before I was even accepted into Case_ about job app apparently a professor needed TAs and I emailed back asking about it and I was left on delivered üôÉ
I don't know if you can TA a class you haven't taken.....
And they left me on delivered√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
Imagine getting left on delivered by your college lmaoüòÇ
Damn I gotta make a reservation at the Marriott then  :Sadge:
More money spent :Sadge:
is it bad if I'm arriving from outside the US on the 15th in the evening?
once i went to the ER and they laughed at me cuzz i came in cuz my guinea pig bit me
rip
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I own a single pair of pants that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not cargo pants
guinea pigs dont carry rabies
side note: i put in my two weeks today üò≥
its ok, working a lot. i asked for my last day to be aug 8 cuz we're leaving the 13, and she scheduled me on the 11th
Did they get mad hannah?
They mad comfy but more importantly they got mad pockets bruh like I have one for my wallet I have one for my phone I have another for keys and shit üò≠
she asked me if i was going to school yesterday and then i was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìye i was going to put in my two weeks tmw√¢‚Ç¨
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m leaving in 19 days so i figured i would give myself a few days ig
i have to buy a rug still
i just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find any rugs that aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ugly as hell sorry
I don't get ppl who wear jeans
I got a whiteboard calendar and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping I magically become organized enough to use it
U didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t receive it yet?
so i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been using my card
no it hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t transferred into my account because i feared the fee idk i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use venmo
pain
I forgot how the system works
Can u apply for citizenship yet
Ik u gotta do an interview and shit take an exam etc
Venmo isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a thing outside of the US?
Based upon your culinary tastes I'll make my own damn steak
How rate do you eat steak tho
I did a short soy sauce, pepper, and orange juice marinade
Then I scored it and stuffed finely chopped garlic into the score marks and did the outside on high heat while basting and then turned the heat down for a warm red inside
Not bad at all for a steak I spent 7 bucks on
Damn how long did it take to prep that
only about 30 mins
I didn't use my cast iron
My student visa√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s valid till my senior year and then if I can get a job they can sponsor me for a green card
oh fuck me I accidentally buttered my phone
i didnt consider that fact :PensiveClown:
You need to have a ssn to use venmo?
I just did a quick search and we can use venmo without ssn
Which is similar to a ssn apparently
Bruh why does old Eminem go so hard
i used cash when my parents could track my debit card purchases
Oh my parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t track my debit card transactionsüëÄ
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t buy anything sus anyway
OMG TODAY MY MANAGER LOWKEY, LOWKEY ACCUSED ME OF STEALING CASH
Moving on
I remember i closed one night and I forgot to put the checks in the chute üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ. Mfs called me the next day on some "yousef where are the checks thats thousands of dollars" üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I was so damn pissed
I put it in the wrong place and told them where I put them everything went well üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Dude thsts so fucking suspicious someone might be stealing under ur numbers
HOW CAN I FUCKING BE $20 EVERY DAMN TIME
She counted the cash in front of me today and I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even a penny off
And the head manager was like I can check the cameras and I wish I said go ahead
No one has caught me yet
Why do you try to make my life harder than it already is. Why do you hate meü•≤
Dude thats soooo weird cuz 20 is the limit to where Asset Protection has to intervene. Like anything below 20 i think isn't usually payed attention to
It must be a manager or someone else stealing
U should do it urself. I used to do it myself so no one would say shit.
Nah the manager is supposed to do it
Nope. Never. Hell, I double check the amount of change I give to the customer
My parents thought it was sus too
Or someone right b4 u
like how long have you been working there
Apparently it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happened every time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been there
2 WEEKS BEFORE I FUCKING LEAVE
do they know you're leaving?
I put in my 2 weeks yesterday
wait sorry wrong reply
I told them I wish I was told earlier, and she said she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna make people feel bad for messing up the cash. She said a couple times is fine but in my case it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been consistently happening
I guess since you're leaving they figure they can pin it on you pretty easily
I guess corporate finally figured out they're missing $20 each day or whatever
It comes out of the head manager√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s paycheck, which I feel bad about because she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually nice. Wish it came out of the manager who wrote that damn note
that sucks
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not close with any of my co workers except like 2 lol
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not tryna start shit up but if I had it my way I woulda wrecked havoc right then and there
Like they seriously thought that I, *I* am gonna mess up the cash this much? $20 is no small amount
Damn
im close to all my coworkers
I was so close to quitting on the spot and saying idc if I have to be here for 2 more weeks, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not showing up to the rest of my shifts. Good luck finding someone to cover for me in this economy, where y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all are already understaffed and underpaying your employees
My head manager sided with her
Cuz theyre fucking stupid
There should be cameras in the cash office too
What will they do though? Contact corporate?
Thats so fucked up id be so mad gtfo my face with that shit
I WAS SO PISSED YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
Already put in my 2 weeks yesterday
I really dont blame u
Ok but like sometimes people hand me coupons and I am too lazy to throw them out so I stuff them in my pocket until I have to leave, they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get sus of that if they see that on camera right?
if they really wanted to they would have checked cams already
See with my old job they trained like 5-10 cashiers on doing their own tills+some more, so if there was any till that was short even 20 bucks, they'd investigate the person who emptied the till+ every person on that register that day
My head manager passively said she could check the cameras but it would be too much work
like how stupid is she??
Too much work ahaahaha but you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re certainly not too lazy to tell me I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to handle cash
Dude my manager would flip out over 20 bucks the fuck is too much work üíÄ
maybe the manager just hates u lol
I literally mind my own god damn business at work lol unless I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just an unlikeable person in generalü§°
Don't let them pin it on u b4 u leave
we can even help you write the message if you want
Katie got some fucking nerve
~~I just hope I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in trouble for sometimes ringing up my own food without the manager√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s permission but everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gotten lectured on that already~~
my bad :PensiveClown:
She be ight and if she's trying to pin it on u she deserves it üò≠
hi, I'm an associate at the Panera in Columbus, Ohio, and I think someone is stealing from the register and trying to blame it on me before I leave

But i never go over board
then you could point out how you had just taken your two weeks, how they apparently knew about it almost every day and did nothing, how if it was just you making a mistake you'd give too little change as well as too much, how they said they'd "check the cameras" instead of just checking the cameras, etc
Oh yeah I never take a shit ton of food at once

omg
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t try to select everything at once
Pro pro tip: just enroll everything at once, nothing is stopping you
You can but sometimes it can slow things down
less of a chance things go wrong
ok im so scared
dont b

It sounds scary at first but in reality it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not terrible
i have them though
will i die
im gonna talk to my navigator about it in 7 mins
they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give me IV because i lack veins apparently
what happened
I wish I didn't have veins
The bachelor of science degree is 120-133 credits assuming you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fail any classes you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll need 15-17 credits a semester and you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be set
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d die
hannah's alive still

The veins on my left hand look like a really badly written W
wisdom teeth surgery not that bad
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even that drugged

damn
ooooh nice nice but rip junior year then huh

@eekhannah how are you feeling?

It took me a few hours

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have veins so
apparently
my least favorite part is being able to feel my teeth but not my gums
i am starting to feel pain
i can barely swallow food let alone a pill
i tried to eat pineapple and failed miserably
it probably wouldn't work

idk i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have braces
They didnt prescribe u percs?

Now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an 8 hour fucking layover
@moseslee Are you staying at the airport?

Bro why they still fighting:peepoCrybabybottle:

I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even
Online dating just feels
Like tinder and shit?
Their relationship doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really have to make sense to anyone else but them
Ofc can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t speak for them rn cuz they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re fighting butüòÖ
Bruh it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been an hour and they still fightin

no wonder she was upset omg
Bruh the fuck
What the actual fuck
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if she knows this tho
Someone does
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hide this shit
Of course, I don't know much about your living arrangements, but you could stab him in the middle of the night without making noise
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just let this go. That makes this guy thinks his behavior is okay
Nah when I move out I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just get a bottle of bleach and piss in it and leave it in the room
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t kill the guy.
Just fuck him over
Don't dispose of the body at night, because it will create suspicious activity if neighbors hear odd sounds; do it in the morning when everyone is up and about
Ask your roommate (even tho I know this is not soemthint someone would be okay with) if she knows
And if she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
The fuck is wrong with this dude
If the bathtub is detachable, put his corpse in the bathtub and drain the blood from there; blood in sewage system is hardly noticeable since it mixes well with other wastes
The poor girl

He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s definitely lying cuz wtf
hell idk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think he would lie to you
And shit
Then idk

You still have to talk to your partner about it...

Cuz idk
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit the vibes of the relationship
Fuck that bastard

y'all prolly never tried good falafel
yea cuz
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had falafel
i want cat :pepecry:
omg the 4k screen on this laptop :HeartPepe:
Which class
Which stats class
College summer class
I took a stats class for psych
Since I took ap stats in hs
What I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen so far is that all the calculations I did on a calculator in AP statistics, we now have to do by hand in a college stats course
Oh ew what????
*confused in having a formula sheet for the AP exam*
*confused in never taking ap stats*
AP Stats was the easiest math class I took that too I suck at stats
i feel like i took so many aps but never stats for some reason
oh yea I went from stats to calc bc
You took BC?
bc was awful
Worst math class ever
I retook it and realized my BC teacher made my life hell for no reason
You guys have no idea how bad it was for me
my school didnt even offer bc i had to self study with friends
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine tbh
I had a good teacher but like... I just didnt feel like I understood anything
my friend cried after the exam
But you took BC...
I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve too if I took the exam any other year
And barely survived the class
Math is my strongest subject and then I took BC
other than that it wasnt too bad
idk how but I managed to get a 5 on the exam tho so that makes no sense
I took AB since I figured it would be way easier, and I kind of regret not taking BC
ab to bc isnt bad
Ok math major
it really wasnt that bad though ü•≤
Ok but why did pre Calc also have to be so damn hard
honors precalc was awful
TBH precalc was more difficult for me than BC bc it was they introduced e to a whole bunch of new stuff that i never learned before
My sister asked me for help on pre Calc homework this past year and I was like hun sorry but no
what is this alcohol and drug not anymore thing bruh
i did all of that shit yesterday
so boring
i literally took all the tests and then half listened to the vids afterwards
you kinda have to pay a little attention bc they dont autoplay the next video
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot anymore√¢‚Ç¨ bruh I can literally hear this
i consider myself a pretty uptight person like im not smoking weed in college but hearing them saying not anymore rlly just made me shit myself
alcohol can lead to other issues, like heart attacks and seizures, which dont help your GPA that much üòÑ
It just√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t good. There were so many ways they could have made it interesting or communicated their message in a way that stuck with people
lol if i wanted to drink in college this 45 min lecture definitely didnt stop me
im still shitting on this program
im sorry zach üò≠
sex lecture is good tho bc there are definitely going to be ppl who have gone to schools that teach abstinence only and they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know like What The Legal Definition Of Rape Is
this discussion is kinda pointless cus wtf are we gonna do about it üòÇ
unfortunately literally anything created by middle aged adults targeted to adolescents is always going to be like physically painful to sit thru
i said what i said without thinking too hard ü•≤
sad üòî
we called our robot gremlin that year bc after that talk it was all anyone talked about
It Is So Hard To Move These Fatass Depressed Gremlins
just dont have depression üòÇ
oh no I fucked it up

If I wanted a sugar daddy, yes, I probably can go out and get one, because I AM WHAT? SICKENING. You could never have a sugar daddy because you are NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL.

My mf roommate just woke up and immediately went back to fighting with his girlfriend
She sounds like she gonna cry

Where's Zhanda when you need him

Hi gonna cry
dude sis is having a bad time nr
oh
@nobelium19 i need the but(t)
First of all, it doesn't guarantee anything and it is entirely dependent on the internet
Second of all, I wouldn't put my whole trust in it so in addition to the bot I would still manually do it
Third of all, just a disclaimer, don't run it all night just run it a few minutes before 9am
Fourth of all, it requires some setup and programming knowledge so it's not like an application
Fifth of all, you'll have to change Line 18 of bot.py from "hour=7" to "hour=9" otherwise it'll execute at 7am instead of 9am
or still hour 9
I've used it twice; one time, I was actually faster than the bot because the bot had a slower internet, but the second time the bot was faster than me
@ultimateg you need to see this
i really dont know
Lol he's joking, you can't take it even if you wanted to anyways

Fuck
"An error has occured that has stopped transactions from continuing"
nicolas how many classes did you get that you wanted
apparently our first class is a dinner
don't we enroll for sages after we move in
Did the SAGES thing pop up for you on applicant portal yet?
We're enrolled in sages but you're supposed to indicate preffered topics according to the roadmap article
ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t no way i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m paying more than i already do
Apparently it will eventually be at the go.case portal
not yet, i think once the registration marks as √¢≈ì‚Ä¶
fucking LABYRINTH
If you want to replace it with something, I would use the "Switch" instead of "drop" tho
where do i find that
oh i found it
IT TOOK 9 MINUTES

From other people you should've at least chose your preferences but they aren't done assigning them yet

idk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know anyone here who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s taken a class with butler

Butler is p much unavoidable though because of that class
I had 5 credits of Psych transferred over and that was the only psych class I had that I hadn't already taken
OMG THEY ARE MARRIED
I have 60 credits from tri-c but I couldn't get all of my syllabi
Because teachers don't like to reply

This is why you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take cc classesü§™

FUCK COLLEGE
But idk
Omg there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a class about the importance of the sopranos
My school didn't have AP courses hhh

That class
Because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really hard to get USNA seminars
I don't even know what the sopranos are

But don't go to.the butterfly exhibit in the botanical garden...
I mean they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still crawly
i hate spiders
Monarchs are kinda scary ngl
there are only a handful of insects that i don't hate
I don't hate uh
Rollie pollies
There are so many on campus when it rains tho...
Like, I've never seen that many rollies
I forgot the name
Except beetles
Are bad
Beetles are fucking terrifying
Beetles are so goddamn ugly i feel bad
And centipedes have scarred me for life 
After there was one crawling on my face when I woke up, I've never been the same
OH HELL NAH
DONT TALK ABOUT THAT MOVIE
Human centipede
I literally skipped to the nasty parts bc I was so bored
I cannot watch horror movies alone
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really like watching horror alone bc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just better with friends
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do well with horror alone
Or paranormal shit
Idk you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never catch me watching the conjuring
Alone
But i am trying to
Though
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Gawddammit 
That actually sucks if they are assholes. I wouldn't be surprised tho
I'm crying üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain üòî
It's true asf tho üò≠üò≠ 
Idk why I did it üò≠üò≠üò≠
Hey if you got into case U can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be THAT stupid
I think I did the same it was a long time ago I forgot üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I have imposter syndrome 
I swear I shouldn't be here sometimes ü•∞
Peak bad horror
Never watched saw whats it about
Super gory torture shit.
I spelled that wrong I think
Without watching saw
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sooo bad and sooo good at the same time lol
But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stupid
Is it because it's stupid or the serial killer part
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry laila :droidcry: :droidcry: :droidcry:
You have something out against me don't you
Fuck you laila
#sad
If there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no point then why am i  dying on this hill
I'm tired you tired
I contemplated dropping out and being a stripper more than I wanted to
Summer and calculus shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be in the same sentence
I don't remember all I know is that I was about to be a stripper
Never wanna take another math class unless it's stats
I wish I could enjoy math
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m more of a nothing kind of person
at one point i thought i wanted to be an english major but i cannot live without math so that would have been catastrophic
before neuro i wanted to double major as polisci and cs ü•¥
I wanted to do mechanical engineering and computer science
then don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take it
I have nothing in common with any of you here üò≠
I have 14 credits since I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into one class üòÇ
I thankfully got into all of mine
I got all the classes i wanted
i got all of the classes i wanted
anything above 15 is trying far too hard
I genuinely contemplated taking the japn class since it's 4 credits and I already have a few from this summer
But I wanted to see what it would be like and take advantage of the drop period if need be
We can be study buddies AND neighbors
you also have freshman forgiveness. You can drop any class b4 finals and it will go POOF like it never existed
wtf
I want spaghetti
i wouldnt know, I dont got that kinda money
That shit is a fucking cult üòÇüòÇ
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still confused about how
It's stupid asf to me
Its stupid I agree
its for people who cant be trusted to spend their own money, and their parents force the limit of case cash for spending
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m putting money up in that bitch
MWF I end classes at 12:30 üò©
cuz no one deserves to go to that chipotle
It's so bad
Oh
It's usually cold
Lmao wtf
Yeah, it's a sad sight
I just want chicken and rice
It's bad
Trust us
I just want chicken and rice :Sadge:
I get tired from taking a shower
I guess there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always buffalo wild wings
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go wrong with that
They barely get any traffic but that's because its the summer
and they arent open very long
Yk what on second thought cooking isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t so bad
I'm trying to be frugal üò´
As long as it doesn't have nuts/peanut butter
Whats wrong with grilled cheese
Missed course registration bout to go cry
Oh no :(((
Rip
Bruh wtf
or it wont b counted
Wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t emailing the Professor help though?
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take it firse semester anyway
Like the Professor might be able to squeeze another student in, right?
Damn seriously?
why you want to be in the class
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about the sis thing oopsie
Literally all my classes except for neur166 is gone lol wtf is this
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about the official request for the class
fuck this I'm making tacos
I feel so dusty for kissing up to the professors
I want to throw up
I woke up late last year for registration and everything turned out just fine. I made sure never to do that again though
but still
Some of them ain't even neuro
there are still too many neuro majors
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got tall friends though
Damn I'd die
it makes u short
Cuz why so expensive omg
he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t smoke cigarettes anymore
he stopped a couple months before my sister was born
My dad still smokes üòÇ
Damn
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talked to my brother in half a decade
but yeah as i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to leave my sister and i stop hating eachother
I'm going to be gone all this rest of the week for my shadowing rotations, but I'll answer questions in the evenings. It'd be easier if people dmed me so I can keep track of them
My friend was saying the same thing lmao he thought he was unique and stuff majoring in neuro and he wanted to be a neurosurgeon
And it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go away
Oh it just went away
except a pediatrician
Same except I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t become a dermatologist
and his work isn't that gross
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
Uhhh idk if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d call them enemies
But I never really liked them
And never really vibed with tjem
Last night I made it virtually impossible for them to be able to make plans with me before I leave lol
And they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even bother trying harder to make sure we hung out
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna see them before I leave for school
I was supposed to hang out with my friend over a month ago and she said she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d text me and ghosted me for a month
She hung out with the rest of her friends and forgot about me LMAOOOOOO
Which pissed me off because I was ok with tolerating her for an hour or so
And I said I cant hang that week I gotta pack
So I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m relieved that died down quick
That and also when she opened my snap she suddenly remembered that she forgot to hang with me earlier and texted me
that's so rude wtf
Because I said I was packing that entire week
still with the other stuff :/
She gave up so fast which reinforced why I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna hang with them in the first place
My friends and I plan everything out last minute
I was ready for a last-minute plan this week (but was praying that they wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to make it work)
Last minute plans are usually the most fun
But I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate anyone enough to make them hang with my friends lol
its a very big sad
closest one is 2h away in pitt
ours is 30 min away
hannah i hate you
you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just put random letters together and expect me to think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an ikea product
cailee i never lie
i was gonna go earlier today so i could see my boyfriend after he got off work at 5
you will want a desk lamp
i want it
but i m going w my mom now bc she said she would pay if i went with her :blurryeyes:
and i got sick of them so fast
rip
so i want something else
i used to have those as well but they broke so i replaced them with leds
where would u hang them tho
i kinda want them to like border my ceiling
but idk if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s practical
idk what layout i want
also, you dont have that much room in ur down
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that
the border would def work
if you really need it
if you want border of the entire room
@jujulb did u happen to measure taplin 207
you'd need more lights
i want to border entire room
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really wanna use the stinky poopoo overhead light already in the dorm
i cant read the layout lmao
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think about the sunlight thing so my dorm only has sunlight in the mornings
but i could be wrong
you cant
But I guess other grades took those rooms first ü•≤
we went hiking today :uwu
the bugs tho T_T
thats further away
Sad
died after 1 minute
I miss not wheezing severely during physical activity
Sigh
rip me
nothing is decided
@eekhannah why are you in vc alone
Fuck you!
What happen
what happen
I hate it
Statistically, if the acceptance rate is 1%, u just need 100 common app accounts with various stats matching the distribution of the applicants
Which unfortunately also means 100 transcripts and 100 SAT scores, but I don't see what's so difficult abt that
Sorry gyz I just woke up
fake transcripts and grades work
does someone wanna vc in a few minutes
my friends left early and I don't wanna go home
Go outside
andrej isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it like 1am for u

my friend Luke√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s five words ended up being √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtall, long, twink, unemployable, bad at driving√¢‚Ç¨
*u can't employ me*
it goes beyond not being recommended it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like you are actively so terrible that you are literally unemployable
Riddle me this Jenin
If I can't employ you
Why are you running around all over my heart then :StareW:
~~did i kill my brain to a point i don't get what people say~~

I was wondering why I couldn't find anyone with the name you had on MCR

I freaked the fuck out when I saw this

not inverts sorry, makes them all red because of some science
I want a peepy
idk where she is rn
jezuz there's so many death related topics for SAGES
i picked all bio related ones because i am nothing without my major
I love how even dead people are a commodity
I picked the 2 funeral industry ones, the death, mourning, immortality one, and urban ecology
where the FUCK did y'all pick your sages topics I can't understand√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú
I didn't get a topic selector for mine
Discord is broken why do I have this permanent thingy for this server
because threads are FUCKING HORRID
lamia might not have gotten the update yet
The fuck
possibly, I didn't think of that
Shit do I gotta update
sorry lamia, I'm not trying to purposefully torture you
someone could murder my family and I'd buy them a bunny as a gift
The fuck is this
it is such a bad idea
I would kill them
yeah it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna be hard to moderate threads
Yetüò≠
really? I never used it
I was a weirdo and I used (and still use) IRC
I was annoying.
which made the devs realize it was a bad idea
but is that really necessary in something that isn't used for work?
you can disable it if you want
oh so like if there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t enough channels?
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t updated mobile so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to do it when I get home
seems way too chaotic and terrible anyway
why is that even a thing outside of wikipedia
there was a period of time where tumblr was just a complete lawless wasteland and anyone could make it look like you said anything and it was like a site-wide fever dream it was incredible
the cock monologue got so big that staff realized the function was haunted snd they got rid of it
I have this tune stuck in my head thats likw boo BE boo. boo boo bedee boo and I have no idea what it is or why it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave my brain
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like lin manuel miranda√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voice
I couldn't find the template fast enough
sorry about the spam
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
so update: apparently public servers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have threads yet
I just realized that you can open threads and it is its own conversation!
I realized I didn't ask
I dont know much about them but ik damn theyre like 25 million in the world and theyre stateless üòî

Poophead is a horrible camera person
üòÖ surely we can work something out here
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re both in Math 121 and Chem 105
Oh no I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m MWF
So we both in math only
wait shit i just realized how early it was
Mmmm she can seem intimidating
But she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do much
if i end up with SAGES on tuesday i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll cry
tuesday is supposed to be my chill day
though it's like, lunchtime for me
Wrong person
I would never
They really aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that hard
just skip them for now they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll fix it eventually
I did the exam before the vids and got 86%
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m p sure you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a choice
dude i forgot to do the lil answer box thing on instagram
i want to cry
i hate talking to people
fair
Bruh there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so many random dog shit on the street today
i already know all the stuff in the sexual harassment ones though
fair
like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s good that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re there for ppl who haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even been taught about condoms
they are great for telling my mom that they gave us modules about sexual harassment and drugs so she doesn't have to have that awkward conversation with me
And it's a contactless delivery so I don't even have to have a conversation with a person driving a Pontiac grand prix
Once again, your opinion is wrong
Objectively wrong
I want a blind taste test of pizza hut, dominos, papa John's, donatos, rascal house (to clean you out)
I feel bad for the people who got their sex ed from porn
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so true it hurts
we never had any sex ed here, at least not in any official capacity
yeah :( I wish schools and also parents were more open and educational about that stuff
Sex ed in the US sucks so
We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even talk about it there
We just pretend sex doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist
I would die
That wil never happen
It can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even cross our minds or else they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll whoop our asses
Accidentally hooked up her phone to her car√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s speakerüíÄ

i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care to be excluded
oh
Oh me oh my...
they didnt even bother telling us that alc is illegal for underage and kept saying dont drink because science says, the more alcohol, the less studying!
oh
I really genuinely don't mean this condescendingly or patronizingly, but 18 year olds who are 3 months removed from high School and on average are pretty sheltered tend to make extremely poor decisions when consuming alcohol. There is a maturity factor.
A 110 pound person who hasn't ever tried alcohol before getting ahold of a 4loko ends up with me, case ems, and a hospital bill
Oh shit...
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t plan on partaking

my dad is watching the news in spanish and he doesn't speak any spanish
||My dad is now mad at me because I won't quit talking about the enormous ass ulcer I saw today that was full of E coli infection because it's so big and actually probes to bone because every time the patient goes to the bathroom he wipes poop into it and then the nurses have to clean it out, and I saw wound care come and debride it and pull this goopy necrotic plug out of it. you could even see the coccyx glistening at the wound base.||
i would be mad at you too

today I learned that cwru washing machines are internet connected
the internet knows when i wash my clothes
so you dont lug it down the stairs
(and also kick Ferdinand's ass, for he was the only one in the dorm who didn't understand why putting a 3-hour wash cycle for three t-shirts every week was a dick move)
How do you carry the clothes upstairs back to your room tho?
oh oscar
i guess you will perish then
Idk maybe I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just a caveman but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve only ever used one basket

But the coolest test he showed us how to trick the brain into not compensating was he had me move this lady's right hand up and down and side to side really fast while she was resting, and it was really loose and easy, but then he had me do the same thing but while having her draw a big figure 8 with her left hand, and the muscles contracted and got very stiff, suggesting that she had issues with her involuntary PNS posture control and and that's why she was losing her balance in her legs when the light was low, or she was doing something else while moving. This is further exacerbated by the neuropathy because she had such decreased proprioception of her legs, and thus it's hard to make an automatic correction when you're off balance
It was also impressive that this lady was 74 years old and still loved hiking, zip lining, and gardening, and came to the Neuro clinic because she didn't want to slow down or lose ability to do that
doesnt zipline though
ok but she's inevitably gonna slow down with age
but she wants to go as long as possible
Yes, but you can do environmental, pharmaceutical, and behavioral accomodations to continue to decrease the risk of falls, which is what she wanted help with.
that's fair
raunak i wanted to screenshot that
She doesn't care if she has to hike with a walking stick or better tractioned shoes, as long as she can still go and do it, she's willing to try
We're seeing a consult on a 13 year old Amish girl who was thrown from a buggy after a car smashed into it and broke her eye socket, mandible, zygomatic, temporal, and occipital bones in her face and head, in addition to having a right side-broca homologue 1.2 cm subdural hematoma
And a broken pelvis apparently
Unfortunately < 5 % are vaccinated so they're being pwned by delta variant

Now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying redken
Idk my hair feels like one of my dog
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all
But I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like my hair after it dries
Feels like grass with conditioner
i still don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to take care of my hair
i know i shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t brush it after it is dry because i have curly hair but :blurryeyes:
Me too it gets so frizzy like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll comb it and it still looks like it hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been combedüò≠üò≠üò≠
started growing out my hair a few months ago and now it's long and it's just amaze
bye bye curly hair
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even kidding you
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t brushed it yet
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even straighten it
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need a curlerü•∞
except i have curly hair
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so annoying
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t frame my face well enough
NO it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
that i don't know but i strive to find out
nope
too bad
you don't have a choice
Same though :fingerguns:
i strive to be unloved and this is really not helping my goals
Will it though
Will I find someone
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m product of pinned condom but I still feel happy
You have no idea how many times I liked a guy and he ended up liking someone else
eventually it'll work
you have no idea how many times i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve liked someone and been an absolute idiot
Priyanka you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not the only one. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve liked a lotttt of guys who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like me back
But yeah I get why you feel the way you do
But the pain of listening to them gush about another girl they likeü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been a lot of unrequited i just never cared to find out
it hurts
they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deserve u
the pain of getting dumped for another guy :nkopog:
Fuck her

Daddy√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s money
Oh

Oh?
Anyway I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never thought about my exes or either contact them
Idk my friendship language tbh
I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say shut up
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spoken to my ex since we broke up
Double kill
Ok is he actually my ex because we just had a fling that was over text because I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drive to see him/sneak out
So I can say I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been in a relationship, but a situationship
Idk honestly lmfaoooooooo
I have been in 2 but holy shit they all ended up horrible
But y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dating
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s different from a fling because flings are sexual? Idk
Oh shit so I never had a fling LMAOOOOOOOOO
Idk I had a hard time getting over him when we ended things even though i knew it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t last
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had a hard time getting over people i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d hardly spoken to :blurryeyes:
I like my liver though
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s normal and not a shame
_I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even technically in college yet_

I have a mac for school and a pc for jacking off
WTF
i have one laptop with like chimera, VMD, pymol, and other biochemistry software and that's my dumping ground and then i have one for taking notes and daily life
And you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t game on it
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m seriously considering drawing furry shit on patreon
They make more money than doctors do per month :StareW:
R u fucking serious
that being that fur/hair is horrible to draw
lol i got one for 60 bucks and i aint mad (amazon)
idk it came in handy last year a LOT because my building had like no TV's
i am at the airport for some reason
big brain! don't get like the ones above 100 bucks because below is all u need tbh. just pull down the blinds and turn off the lights and ur all good
j remember to get hdmi cables (i forgot and it cost me a week of movie watching until my amazon package came)
Oh you can watch them on the blind? My roommate and I were considering getting white sheet but it seems like we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to?
oh no you can project it on the wall but make ur room suuuper dark to see it because some projectors aren't the greatest at that price range. i wouldn't suggest doing blinds because it looks like crap on there
to connect ur device (laptop, switch, phone) to the projector
yes the wall, and np np!! some buildings *ahem* smith *ahem* had common rooms without TVs so it was a pain in the butt
bro this isnt 60 bucks
Why not just watch it on your laptop
computer would be too tiny
issa pain to setup tho beware lol @lamarcindale
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not on the schedule, i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on my two weeks, and i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work this week
gotta work up the courage to text my manager
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to get job on campus because work study so nbd
You still gotta apply
damn
They don't just hand you a random job like the bee movie
There are a lot of jobs around campus, but there are also a lot of people qualified for work study
They do tend to pay like 10-12 dollars per hour though
i work as a tour guide, an OL, and as a researcher at UH. handshake will be ur way to go tbh
but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not only looking at work study so idrk
rip which handshake posting was a 9 im curious
Case student works cannot earn 15, max is 14, cuz case is stupid
^ in tour guide dept. one person who works with me is paid 15 (non-work study)
Non work study is different
This may b tru, but hannah was mentioning work study
So i went with that
However the risk remains that now visitors and guests are allowed, there could still be a population of people getting exposed by unvaxxed guests

thank youuuu ^^ here's hoping I don't get the same fever
I already got my vaccine 2000 years ago when Jesus Christ died on the cross, Jesus is my vaccine and mask √¢≈ì√Ø¬∏ üôè
I've seen numbers at full immunity (so 2.5+ weeks after 2nd dose) at about 88-94%
However, hospitalization risk with ANY vaccine is near 0
I do not want to go in the weewoo van in the US
man i just want to go to sleep and not wake up for a while
a one day trip to the hospital would be waving goodbye to my yearly pocket money
guys I'm packing my shit bc I'm going to a friend's house and staying there till I leave for case on the 14th and HOLY SHIT I have so much excess clothes/shoes
I also hope no one gets hospitalized (as in, no one gets hurt or sick, not that they are left for dead lol)
You don't get any bill for getting checked out by Case EMS or transported
anyway, it's late and the vax appointment is early in the morning
No Cambria either
that's not too bad
now imagine if we need 3rd doses
like 6 hours of sleep
There is a lot of work going into determining if we can just use the surplus of the first two, or if a 3rd booster needs to be specifically crafted
just not asleep
2nd dose is mandatory for the vaccine to work in full efficacy
sorry I meant third
i don't know if it's mandatory but it's encouraged
Oh dang-
do you think if i went to sleep now i would wake up at a weird time hm

@stuckinohiolads how are u feeling
Ngl the swelling went down and today I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to have chipotle so we vibing!! No pain but all my stitches fell out for some reason either because I swallowed them or I chewed them up in my sleep!! Wbu

Im getting my wisdom teeth out on Thursday
Bottom two are growing in side ways and causing pain for weeks. I have to give a presentation on my cancer research this summer 24 hours laterüòç
First day was bad though
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in it and I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get out
wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad but i had local anesthesia so
if u have the option (and insurance) for a steroid dose pack, do it, it makes recovery faster and less painful (but also gave me mad acne)
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re having a party without you
it's the bad type too - v bloody
How long until you can feasibly exercise again. I heard you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t supposed to at first
i tried going for a long run and it felt like my heart was beating through the spot where my wisdom teeth used to be (this is 4 days out). i'd say give it a week
I do, when the title catches my eye

2 weeks until move in
no fever yet
hopefully no fever ever

based as a roasted racoon seasoned with fresh herbs grown in a mini garden made of a collection of boots taken from the feet of sleeping homeless lesbians in Atlanta and grains of salt grinded from a block of pink Himalayan salt taken from the delivery van of a local high quality grocery chain that had it shipped straight through the suez canal during March 2021 and cooked inside a makeshift oven made from the radiator of a 1981 Ford F100 inside the small shack in the corner of a swath of trees I rent for $50/month from the multimillionaire that owns this property as well as a small collection of Canadian bookstores that specialize in existentialist Japanese and Lebanese novels
buddha u aren't a capitalist, you believe in self-sufficiency?!
when bartering i'm worried about maximizing my utility and the other person is interested in maximizing their utility. I'm not worried about their utility and they aren't worried about mine.
If i'm giving you goods you better be damn well sure that you're gonna give me something in return or else i'm not giving you stuff anymore
that's bartering tho
that happened
but ppl still did transactions
that's why it's the perfect middleground, because while we are guided by self interest, we still did transactions and shit even tho we may not get something in return, we HOPED to get something in return
so bartering is still capitalism
batering is capitalism sin money
i mean yeah thats fair
idk i didn't pay attention lol
so why bother study it lol
I could be wrong though
Prada and Gucci dont go together
Its stuck in my head
uhhhh..... show me a peer reviewed study that says this

@halcyon6561 didn't even know about that site
damn another band i have to listen to
I designed a pcb that carries it and some graphics hardware i spun up, never spun up the board though
damn u right
(source: I have tried)
65C02 has that spiky taste that you cant get from edible foods
8080 were the ones that actually dominated thought because intel just gave them away
dont get me started jesus christ
i've ate a ferrule or two in my day
tech mentor walking in that day was very upset and didnt know fully how to express it
we have one of those awful crimping tools that is impossible to use and I have a hypermobile disorder so i dislocate shit easily
idk how he managed it
we ended up getting a ratcheting one this year but i nevber got to use it :tasha:
idk how our electronics team managed tbh he had big ungraceful hands with extreme grip strength and a genetic tremor and I
have very long dainty fingers that get dislocated easily and also I have terrible eyesight and weak wrists
i wired the entire fucking 2020 robot it was pain
dude we tried to train a 3rd person and it straight up just didnt work 2 people already get the job done in like a week
mostly dimitri would just sit there doing nothing until my little idiot weakling hands couldnt do something because they were too weak
electronics is great bc for four weeks youre sitting there going "what motor do you need. what motor do you need. what motor do you need what m" and then in week 4 u just stay there for 3 6-hour sessions and finish it before most of the team was even aware that you started
last year we had the most beautiful setup we had a double decker electronics box that could unfold and all of the pieces came out individually
ugh clean
annie i'm gonna come hang in ur room and talk about FRC and jen is going to hate it
actually he was always trying to use raspberry pis and the team kept not letting him for some reason but idk why i only half payed attention to what was happening in software
literally bypassed wpilib in multiple places because "it's not fast enough"
he is also the kind of person who doesnt understand that other ppl cant read code so he would show me lines of code and be like "look how scuffed this is" and I would be like mhm
dimitri was like my programming interpreter he would translate problems into what they caused
damn i wish we had that
he only actually got it on the electronics tools because we were the worst about that
ended up being like 90% accurate
it was fucking bonkers
in my sophomore year i was scouting head and i revamped the way we did sheets and did a really sophisticated color coded system and then junior year the scouting head just copied my code but like did it bad so i had to spend an entire night fixing his google sheet for him
DUDE we ALMOST got third picked by 254 and then we got SNIPED by a team who DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHAT OUR ROBOT DID
we were like KNOWN for being the best defense bot at comp and this team picked us for ball and then learned we couldnt do ball and tried to request to switch us out
we couldve gotten a guaranteed spot at champs god damn it
didnt even try to cheesecake us which i was stunned by
cheesecaking doesn't usually happen in FIRST NC because teams aren't good enough to make their own robot and make a cheesecake-able mechanism too
yeah well teams in NC dont have nasa machining their bots for them
clean
yeah my team too we had 1 mentor who was the head of the CS department at the school and then 1 guy who had a chemistry degree and didnt know what was going on and then 1 guy who was an alum who was good at strategy
like in cali y'all have nasa cutting your parts, in NC we have to build our own machines to cut our parts
if we were all getting shit done by nasa then 254 wouldnt be at champs every year
and you would be wrong
we tried ramp in 2018 and chopped it off bag night
*sounds of electronics team souls leaving their bodies*
our robot from last year's FRC
*posts nothing*
this was the first year we used sparkmaxes and the nice motors which i cant remember the name of and it turned out our base code was a fucking shambles and it didnt work with an actually good drive system
Where did u gyz go on putin bay last time
here you go, sorry, I had to dig it up
15lb battery held to robot with masking tape i shit u not
So we basically went all over the island. There were caves that we checked out and I went jet skiing (you could also go kayaking). I think you could also hike but I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bring my hiking shoes so. I forget where we ate but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s right in Boardwalk and the food was alright.
our battery fell out the back of the robot and disconnected during a match one time
except 1.5lb instead of 15lb
i know the feeling
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think we went to any other cave√¢‚Ç¨¬¶..
i ended up telling him that I just eyeballed it
this is our captain 18 hours before bag
dont let our fancy facilities fool you. we are a junker team who cant do math
And you get to sample some too if you want
Cuz we land at the airport
I wish but hotels all booked
And yea theres another cave i think its called perry's cave
We didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go oop
Aw rip what happened :(
No cuz im not 21 I wasn't trynna risk it
You just need a drivers license to drive the cart though
How long will kayaking take tho
Wallah I dont even wanna talk about it üíÄüíÄüíÄ it's fine it was still fun
I need to know tho
I didnt know that
Yes and by the airport u can get on a helicopter
Do u need like swimwear
Or in a plane
No need, we take our own plane
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get too wet
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear flip flops or sandals though
You might lose them
Never done jetski tho, sounds too intense
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t either before the trip but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so fun. Although I did have to take a quick test for a temporary boating license to be able to use one
How long wil that take tho
@_zacc they made dimitri safety captain last year because he was quote √¢‚Ç¨≈ìa walking PSA about what not to do√¢‚Ç¨
I studied for 10 minutes and the test took me like 3 minutes to complete
Ohhhh I saw that but we ran out of time :((((((
I guess we saved money then
Wtf u even considered that?
We just drove past it and considered it for a min but we couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go because of time
Wtf
For 5 min actually not bad
Oh
I'll charge u 40 bucks for an even longer island tour how abt that
I forgot I didnt do it it was my cousin who went on it
Idk I believe the 3 min tour isn't of the whole island
Oh gosh
Hard pass
I'll never financially recover from that
Nope not yet
You should. You could make serious bank
The amount I charged can even cover the plane
Also I don't have a commercial rating so
I legally can't
Oh fair

imagine not getting the polio vaccine and then giving someone polio
Are we allowed to buy furniture n shit for our room?

I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think you can remove the existing furniture

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never looking at the back of a Tesla the same ever again
Must√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been an awful long 11 months
Still a virgin doe :PES_Angel: üôè
It was because anything bad that would happen I would blame it on myself to hiding something like this from my parents
I decided to come clean
SHIT WHAT DID HE SAY
Damn Zach :PES_Cry:
Lame
he said lame
For me it hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been hard to wait because no guy wants meüòå
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THAT IN A WHILE
dude i just push people away as soon as i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to enter a relationship üôà
is anyone else's residence hall thing still on awaiting
i finished it and completed it but like its stil on awaiting and im scared
Tbh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just never wanted to put in the effort to have a relationship
Too much work üòÇ
Idk if I want a relationship because like my parents strongly advise against it until I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ready and then I think yeah I need to focus on my goals anyway but at the same time I WANT A MANS TO JUST LOVE MEüò≠üò≠üò≠
Like shit
I pushed all my friends away because I was in a relationship and then the relationship ended and now I have no friends and no relationships
Oh dear
but did you: enter a toxic relationship and become a bad person as a result thereby making all of your friends hate you
yeah I mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m good now but man did I make bad life choices
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done almost everything except actual sex
omg twinsies!
I became a bad person but I was not the toxic one
I know someone who has a 23
Damn Zhanda you beat me
never
My score is a 99 and no I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never held hands romantically
Idk why buying condoms counts as a sin but
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss something if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never done it beforeüòéüëç
I miss hugging someone so tight
For hours
I can't honestly say there is anything left that I'd do
Fucking whore
the feeling of when you had a relationship and now you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t is the worst
i was much happier when i left my relationship than when i was in it
I mean objectively you feel better overall but there are bad times
You know that you have "Buddha" spelled wrong in your name
I tried to stay away from trying to find a relationship again out of respect for my ex but then she goes and dates who used to one of my best friends so üôÉ
How the fuck do you get a 35 on the test, zach
I have days where I feel like an independent bad bitch and then some days I yearn for a bf
everyone needs to stop being too relatable
i mean i was back and forth a bit ago but now i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be single anymore
why ocean documentaries tho
I wish I was a fish
My score was worse than yours üò©
Zach, most of the choices on this test are equally horrible...
I didnt know
Nothing wrong with drugs
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still pure in the eyes of Allah
So you can't reproduce

All business suck atp

I had this good one. But something happened and he had to go on leave üòî

I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gonna go back to work there in the winter
i hated my fast food job
And she thought she did something when she threatened to take that option away
Do you still wanna go hiking together :0
I remember I got in a fat argument on the floor with a manager in front of customers üíÄ
shes still dead
Oh

Weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you taking a shit? @Deleted User
Dude it was snowing and she told me to go outside to push carts. Which btw we would have cart pushers if the top managers hired ppl but they were too fucking incompetent. I didnt even have a coat and she was like yea go out i said no üíÄüíÄ
I said get someone else. I dont have a coat

I woulda pushed the manager into the cold
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to work for corporate
Tell her that you aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gonna wear some stanky ass coat tf

where did you work?
More adults have been having the audacity to talk to me with disrespect these past few weeks and today I realized that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s because I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in grade school anymore
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to get work experience before I leave. learning to be a cashier and drive a forklift and stuff
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so late
Cashiering can be bad

Its so fucking boring
I used to tell my managers get me the fuck off register im tired of this üò≠
So boring dude
my feet get sore
And sometimes old ppl would be annoying
So it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad
Since it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a big store like Walmart we could chill sometimes
So it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t horrible
I used to fuck around sometimes but still it would get boring dude. Like it was just the same over and over
But it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a super small store like a gas station where it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just you and the register
Oh my√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
So I was bored af
gas station clerk must be boring as hell
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like talking to customers it was the coworkers that I could complain about things to
complaining about things with coworkers is like the highlight of my work day
But u need to understand
when they complain but don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help or do work its terrible
like I get that x is a problem but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your job to fix x
I would complain about school and my coworkers would complain about college
My older coworkers would be like whats so hard !
life is hard
Life a bitch and then you die ü•∫
Dawg I remember I was having a tough shift üíÄüíÄüíÄ last customer had a fucked up container of tomato sauce. I pick it up to scan it and shit spilled all over the register and me

WRONG PLACE
if you're just starting with Java then dr java is good
it has a running program where you don't have to do steps you won't understand until later
~~idk how to english~~
intelliJ is a little more advanced and it doesn't have the interactions pane so you have to do the lines to run the program and print it
u'll save a lot of time :4_cry:
it doesn't require boilerplate code
if I've never done java before, is csds 132 overly difficult?
go to office hours
is scary
Fuck you motherfucker
damn
I really, REALLY want Kung pao chicken rn
I need me some Jesus in my life amen
I need some Allah in my life wallah

Dude ever since I started lifting my heart beats different. It feels like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been put in acoustic mode
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad
Is it beating really irregularly or
Do you have clean as part of your routine
I never see people clean at the gym
Yeah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really do cleans
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deadlift
Last time I did it I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t walk for like two days
Yeah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like squat
I cal clean 195 but I can barely squat 135
Someone arrest this man
Idk how people deadlift tho it destroys your body
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deadlift as much as I squat
I can deadlift like 400 If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ok with not being able to walk for a week
Damn nice
And you damn well should be
I used to love preworkout but now I think that it might be bad for you
Idk if I know what that is
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat anything right before a workout
Well yes but don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dry scoop unless you hate being alive
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t people do that all the time
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat for at least 2 hours before lifting
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never step foot in a gym
~~oh wow u tried~~
I only started to seriously lift bc the weights coach at my hs in sophomore year was an asshole to me
~~I am a weakling I know which is why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like working out in a public gym~~
Imma work
And last summer I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get up 185
Damn
Oscar could literally throw anyone across the room with his pinky if he wanted to

~~i'm making my resume, something is wrong with me~~
I'm trying to make mine
idk what to put
so there isn't much to put
~~I translate shit for TED conferences and Translators without Boarders~~
Are high school activities/awards relevant when applying for a job, or just what you do/get in college?
do we have access to downloading microsoft 365 yet
mmm i'd sayyyy
add things that you feel would be relevant to whatever u want to apply to
I just list my accomplishments on LinkedIn, but I don't have an actual resume üò¶
~~I didn't do any APs in High school~~
I don't wanna remember the nightmares
IB HL Math
oh godd
My school didn't offer IB unfortunately
Our previous IB chem teacher that taught the class before mine got fired for sexting with a student
my old math teacher that taught me in sophomore and junior year left to go to lockhead martin, and our new teacher senior year was ABSOLUTE SHIT
Dw you're not alone
Like I couldn't learn shit in that class bc her teaching was horrendous
ok imma yeet i don't want to remember high school yet :eenapeace:
A lot of teachers in my school left when COVID hit since the administration at my school sucked and required teachers to teach in-person in an unsafe learning environment
All the good teachers at my hs have been leaving
absolute pain
They made a TON of promises, like putting hand sanitizer in every classroom and providing PPE, but they never actually did anything
Our school did that
So, a lot of teachers at my school went on a temporary leave and my school was desperate to hire replacements, which were not very good
They never actually let seniors go back in my school district
Yeah, but also I really wish I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone back
Seniors went back in-person towards the beginning of the school year and every1 went virtual towards the middle of the year, only to come back when there were two weeks of school left
I feel that
No because as an adult I hate flying
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think we even have 14 days for Christmas
The normal presentation is about half an hour so there was a bunch of background information missing
Bringing a stash of tea leaves because there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t any Indian stores nearbyüëÄ

not that far tho
Forgot about the CMA

I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t zoom in far enough
Oh goodness
Oh my goodness gracious

what happened
since braces
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me
But once I cut them
Omg
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like gooey
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like
It makes me think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s getting bad
Which I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like
Sadly I do not have white

Do you? If so, want to trade
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m suddenly in the mood to paint my nails
Like 1/3 of mine are just awful
But I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t thrown them out yet
Some of them won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even fucking open
This is my fucking body
I'm a buddhist so I can't be vaxxed üòî

i have a feeling i will get muted now
they have gone after the chinese. soon they'll come after the arabs and the indians
Is there something wrong üò≠üò≠üò≠
What happen
Always trying to silence minorities dude
Yea im antivax. What the fuck about it
annie might be tho
Damn
This is so fucking mean
Like aren't u from the Midwest
We're supposed to unite
Oh shit ur west coast
I know a few from cali and they swear to me the smog isn't bad but they have bronchitis coughs
it's not the smog that's bad dude they're technically correct
oh that
Same shit annie
theres not as much smog bc everyone drives teslas
the only ppl who dont vape are the ones who set the state on fire
maybe i muted @chandachan bc he doesnt vape
ive literally never said im not racist
bruh u white as fuck
bro u think arabs cant be white? why are u so racist
Well the government didn't think women could vote till the 1900s
is this implying that the women could vote even tho the government thought they couldnt?
Dawg u know wtf I meant
i want whatever finn is smoking
which victoria woodhull pointed out when she ran for president and then got arrested and then lost
DAWG IM DYING
wtf
that made it legal or that made it necessary? idk what specifically ur reffering too but the way the constitution normally works when it comes to rights is that it just says what the government cant do right
wtf is happening in the server rn
i would never claim not to be racist
@.bugcatcapoo are you calling me a sexist cause im brown. you racist fuck
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not wrong
No annie dont SILENCE
Don't be a commie
did the constitution already say that all citizens could vote tho?
Annie dont silence us
finn doesn't like women voting
i thought that didnt come till later
tenth ammendment i think?? but i might be wrong about that
Finn im literally so fucking disappointed
Fuck france
so it wouldnt have been in the constitution body or in the bill o rights
its saying this weird thing about how people who cant vote reduce representation or smt
So u guys are willing to read the constitution, but when given the Bible, u refuse to read.

This is what's wrong with this generation. We need martial law
Yeah it still doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t phase many lawmakers
no what it says is that if people cant vote bc like they commited felonies or whatever then that means u have to reduce the representation of that area by the same amt
the 15th is really short
it just says u cant deny voting by race
i guess?
it doesnt follow from the amendments tho
she also used it as a major point when she ran for president
i mean also they couldnt prove that she COULDNT run for president so instead they arrested her for writing pornography to ensure she would be taken off the ballot
she ran in 1870 i think
or no that wouldnt be a presidential year
she also registered fredrick douglass as her running mate without his knowledge or consent
she was such an icon. what a fucking weirdo
damn she whack
like she just says shit with no evidence and then runs for president about it
like she thought that prostitution laws unfairly targeted women who didnt have control over their situations and that it should be legalized and regulated in order to protect people from harm, and she publicly spoke out about women's sexual liberation and the double standards society held about promiscuous women, but also she thought that if you waved magnets around a person's body it would improve their health
so basically like in her 20s and 30s she was a hustler, con artist, political activist and proud slut, and then after she lost the election she was like "i lied actually it is bad to be a woman and women are bad. and we should all be good mothers, and also we should euthanize my son"
don't worry about what's "right" or "wrong", or argue over what's "good" or "bad". just think in terms of interests, i.e. what do you need, what do you want, and what are your plans.
jesus christ how is every single take you have so fucking bad
its like u see and issue and think for 2 seconds about what u can say that sounds edgy or makes u seem smart or unique or makes it seems like ur looking at the issue from an outside opinion unlike most sheeple and then u just hit send without actual giving any thought to whether what u said makes any actual sense
It's bad in your eyes. Thanks for the feedback.
Because I can understand my goals without having zero regard for other people
The only people who feel no remorse over their own behavior are√¢‚Ç¨¬¶literally psychopaths
Taking a look at other people√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s interests? So√¢‚Ç¨¬¶socializing? That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s clearly not what you meant earlier when you said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worry about what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s right or wrong, just think in terms of interests, I.e. what do **you** need√¢‚Ç¨
Sorry but the church may have said being gay is wrong but they certainly did not tell me that being an asshole is wrong. So the church warped morals to their own liking, that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean all morals are wrong? They are literally the foundation of society
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all mad here
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally pine trees in my back yard
Listen here buddy you might think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re Aristotle with your big wet moral-schmoral erection but no one here wants to suck it because it smells as bad as the bullshit coming out of your mouth

If you want the attention, I suggest Quora. Oh wait.
i have work today
which sucks
Wtf is going on in this chat
Go outside
There are just more restrictions due to rise in covid cases
Does that mean that parents won't be allowed with you during discovery week?
if they dont have a flight back till later, they can get a hotel in the area
they arent banned, its just that case doesnt expect them to b here
Forgot the name lmao üòÇ
idk, I've never heard of parents doing that
mine didn't, and every other international student I've ever met hasn't had that
I mean, then again, we don't exactly have the money to fly willy-nilly either lol
They're gonna make it a vacation for themselves üòÇüòÇ
That's why they wanted to come so bad üòÇ
because it doesn't seem to make sense to get an overseas flight just to send your kid off and nothing more
really?
don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that
i'd say that's true esp that international flights are expensive. however, a lot of parents would still want to see their big boi off :Loved: ~~u may also need help with moving and shopping and driving in case u don't know anyone in the area~~
so u don't have to 100% deal with it alone every time
i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find my glasses :blurryeyes:
i really need to stop losing them this is starting to become a problem

@_frostyyyyy_ one week till I hug you in person
kinda wish my parents wouldn't tbh
Same i fucking lose them all the time its so frustrating

And I could not get that shit right
I TRIED SO MANY THINGS

and americans never get it
my actual name is so ez and I still don't hear Americans get it correctly :KEKDisco:
People screw up my last name pronunciation a LOT even though it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pronounced how it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s spelled
imagine not being able to pronounce Yang correctly
~~Even though this Yang is not my Yang~~
You wouldn't think mine would be hard but I've still been called Zachary Zucchini before
ZUCCHINI IS NOT THAT CLOSE TO ZICCARDi
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED
I get that all the damn time
Why do you go by Oskar instead of Yang

Another republican died of covid after mocking masks and vaccines
Rip
Well, we tried
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that ironic
Oh no how horrible
Feel bad for the family
I don't know if I do
oh phew then it's not smaller
You wanna be a doctor and still judge people after their death?
Someone died
Yeah they may have mocked masks and the vaccine but they died of a disease
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like death in general so I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve preferred no one dying but ..yeah
Not one *yet*
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to put it
Yeah but I feel like as a healthcare professional, after seeing all the horrific death and how innocent lives are claimed because of other peoples negligence
Yes but he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s allowed to feel however he feels
Never said he can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel that way but ok
~~it still sucks, adding to the fact that it's avoidable~~
But still
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Florida my Fauci üò©
@sprinkles2108 i'm starting to doubt if my clothes will even fit in there
I brought my winter sweaters already and dunno if that was the right move
I had to leave some I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear all that often behind
I just want to sit in a building not my room and study
You find jeans to be comfy?
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a hard no for me
I associate sweatpants with being sick so i don't wear them
Also I'm too fat for joggers
I mean I feel bad for the antimaskers a little bit because they were victims of misinformation
Unfortunately they also had Tucker Carlson
Like some mfs just have problems with authority
It is what it is I guess
if I grew up in the south with idiot parents idk what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be like
jus bored :nkolostcritty:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at work and I saw some Mennonites
I feel so bad for those guys, they got absolutely devastated by covid

~~idt mine are out yet~~
anyone wants to chat? :CB_lurk:

I would get discounts n shit in China cuz my dentist used to be rlly close friends w my aunt at the hospital they both worked at
personally i wanted to do it before i moved 600 miles away from home
Also I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been to a dentist in almost a decade :cursed_flushed:
Mainly cuz almost 0 sugar diet :naenae:
IM SO MAD

I have yet to see a good next gen continuation of an anime except jojo√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s
Idk

why do you shave your head
I have shoulder length hair but I have an undercut except the undercut is bald
Yes I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let it get very long
Do I be shaving maybe once a week or 2 weeks
I would still just shave outside the shower and throw your hair in the trash
also, it'd be overall cleaner if u don't shave inside the shower
cuz ~~flashbacks~~
personally i didn't use that one a lot anyways, i didn't like it :LAUGHING:
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t vouch for anything this says but here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a link
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so many knots in my hair :Sadge:
french braiding pigtails is hard bc u have to switch hand positions halfway through
Imagine having the neck strength to be able to have that hair
imagine how bad shedding hair would be

It's so humid I want to melt
This is awful
This feels like pain

U scared tf outta me

What non freshmen class would have 200+ students tho
rip
i just want to be in person :(
Cuz
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t handle
my motivation in online school was terrible
Wtf were u doing making meth
My instructor for Calc 3 last semester got her section for Calc 3 removed from SIS since she's teaching it to remote students instead
Don't make me an accessory after the fact
Damn i really don't remember asking
@toomanyzs want to see someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s back cut open with metal rods in their spine. Pic my dad took during a surgery
tuesdays and wednesdays are gonna *suck*
I can't take it

Y'all I think I might have broken my toe
I want baked beans now
I still only have 9 credit hours so far in my schedule
God damnit I can't even take the most important courses of my major this year FML
I didnt get sopranos üòî @lamarcindale
I got mine
oh
My bad lmao
I was just resting my head
Dw about it, car sleepy
It didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
then you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it yet
i didnt get mine yet
Ok that means u didn't get it yet
@sir_sammy also doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have it
I really do
if i dont get childrens picture book im gonna cry and sob
Since you guys are all depressed that you didn't get your sages choice, here is a pic of a baby goat to compensate
If u need help i gotchu I watched that shit like 10 times
im still on placeholder mode
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
you can't tell me what to do
Man I wanted sopranos üòî
Aw :(
dam I wish they had a grey's anatomy sages
I wish they had a friends sages
fuck u @alexthedawg
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten mine either
Y r yall worried classes start the 23rd
Hush you already got your class
I WANT TO SEE IT
Well you can kind of tell which ones you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get bc some are filled on sis
So I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m either going to be in children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s books or weird fictions bc they both still have 17 spots left
Insulting 13 year old customers at my job with no consequences
omg
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten get mine yet
Istg if I get fucking urban ecology
you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably the crappy navigators who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get ours out yet
I know mine sucks lol
i know someone else was complaining about him @m2025. ü§ê
He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally so terrible. During that required meeting he let me ask one question and rushed me off like 3 mins after it started
they are just someone to consult
it probably just depends on the class
And when I asked him about class scheduling he was like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyeah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know√¢‚Ç¨ ü§®
I rlly want death and immortality :Sadge:
still no sages
hes my navigator too and the same exact thing happened during my meeting :/
that is awful
dude the same exact thing happened to me
Well this is terrible lol
someone said they emailed him and he's not working for case anymore tho? so if u have questions he tells u to email desantis
Emailed Mason or Jordan? Because the director used to be Aaron Baker but he just left
I chose urban ecology

But I also received this rather passive-aggressive email from my navigator saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou need to choose SAGES courses that _don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t_ clash with your classes√¢‚Ç¨ but not explicitly √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsome of your SAGES courses clashes with your classes√¢‚Ç¨ probably because I have a few music classes with undefined schedules idk this is a scheduling nightmare
that's so weird bc i thought the only sages options that showed up had to be ones that didn't clash with your schedule
FUCK
rip
There is the chance that she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that

But she may be also right because I can only register for music classes _on campus_ which is honestly so fucking dumb
my sages professor isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t on ratemyprofessor
mine has a single review
apparently mine is a tough grader üôà
OMG
The sopranos fucking suck
FUCK U
oi don't be mean to him
sorry üòî
U didnt get it?
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get any class yet
To show you that the class is completely available
Why the fuck didn't I get it üò≠üò≠
They dead wrong
your sorry
Should I email someone?
ay bank busrof el sorry ta3tak???
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eaten anything since I woke up less gooooo

My roommate wanted that one so badly haha
Aw dang that was definitely her first choice I felt bad she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it haha
sounds boring üò≠
plsssss i want my mother mf fucking sages
y are some people getting theirs and others arent
idk
Did u get wat u wanted
It hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been posted yet
I just want death and immortality plz
Oh the class
I think I accidentally scared a dude at the gym lmao
iirc @raunakwastaken took a class with her
every one of the reviews says they she makes the students read and write a lot but idk if that's just bc it's a writing class or if it's a lot even compared to other writing classes
and apparently there's a 10-12 page research paper at the end of the semester...
That's not that bad
If you work on it early
i guess
It can be very bad if you try to do it in 2 days
There's nothing wrong with a hard class if it's interesting and has good content
im just bad at writing lol
what about erika olbricht? rmp says she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a tough grader üòÉ
if its for every sages then it cant be that bad i guess üòÇ
*Oh fuck I forgot to do my writing portfolio*
damn i have a fsna
Move in day 1 is only 4 days away
It seems at least from my roster that most people are still doing sunday
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m moving in on saturday
fuck you @therealoj32
missing 3 weeks of one piece was worth it :run:
I cant find their name
and the placeholder will be replaced with an actual class if you got one
mine didn't appear yet bc i ve choose different SAGES class
i'm still waiting
I feel violated
I think someone said they did
The class is shit
Pork smells so bad tf
None because I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat pork
dog? :flushed_soviet:
Honestly, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll survive. It just a lot of work on a very boring topic
I don't constitute as an Asian American right :StareW:
arent all the sages classes a lot of work?
Nope
my prof is 4.5 and apparently the class is bad üò≠
im starting to think rmp isnt that reliable
Well crap
damn üò≠
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMR16mqX3/ I want to become a bills fan after this

What happened
I have to go back to my room
I'm pissed
We're all vaccinated why are they locking us down so hard
It started pouring as I was walking but thankfully I had a rain coat. Got drenched from mid-thigh down
Yeah we just sadly watch you guys playing frisbee and eating in groups of 30 and having fun and dancing
@sprinkles2108 if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not in your OL group√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ throw the whole school away
||just kidding I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t||
I put up my door decorations today
By today I mean 8 minutes ago

You go and have fun with the OLs during the day and then we fix the problems at night
oj did nothing wrong!!!!
i bought some parts to crank up the storage of my macbook pro (why tf do they even sell macbooks with 128gb of storage now), but basically that was a whole process of fighting with macOS installers to get it to work
my desktop decided to eat shit
I TAKE THE ENTIRE FUCKING COMPUTER APART
Oh, see you could have just bought a Windows machine and then it would have taken 5 minute to upgrade the storage
rip
Oh whoops I responded to the wrong thing
I would have still had to wrestle with windows installation
Not if you didn't upgrade your bootdrive
I take the entire computer apart, clean the cpu socket, put it back together, and then boom
i like having a windows desktop, but like i can't stand laptops made by people other than apple
It is hard. And every year something worse happens to me, and after last year's bear mace incident I decided to just absolutely throw myself into the fire and scheduled my on-call for Halloween
i bear maced him last year
~~i've a premade laptop with a 3060~~
Isn't bear mace illegal in the US üò≠
~~imagine not just having a laptop and a desktop~~
i shit u not
About 18 drunken people in Leutner pavilion who were bear maced after a guy decided he wanted pepper sprayed and one of his friends said "say less" and then they all ran around in pain and throwing up and were dumping gallons upon gallons of milk on their eyes
I want tiger mace
it took 3 EMS crews and 6 hours to clear the whole thing up
Yours fucking truly
so like, what the fuck do you do in that situation
i'm sorry for ur pain but that sounds hilarious in retrospect
honestly most ra problems could be solved with bear mace?
A toilet is broken?
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like someone? Bear mace
Shit you got nitro
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a weak ass who surrounded and went to foundation
Jenin just wants the tea
Everyone wants tea
But don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want any part of it
I think I know someone who was there at the bear mace incident
annoying*
I can't stand this anymore
But I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dealing cards
i still have the stuff from last year
I have never gambled
zach im starting to suspect bigotry
im a half commie
Bad
Is your left side commie Yousef? Do you share stuff with your left hand?
i use my right hand to manipulate the stock market and left to destroy the class system
dude i dont think it mattered
Fuck Robinhood
Stock market is a game of studying rich ppl psychology
Me n my homies hate robinhood
Oh shit speaking of which
FUCK
Oh
I lost more than that today üò¨
Rip
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never done any

Day trading takes more time and usually leads to worse results
*i feel something so right, doing the wrong thing* :PanMusicJams:
I feel brainless
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I can make my stuff fit in my suitcases
It seemed like I had so much room and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m realizing I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m f*cked
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bring everything
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna ship more stuff
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the stuff that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fit
Boots, hangers, and the cooking stuff I forgot to ship üò¢
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to put those in the suitcases
I feel like that would work then

I put my tuff in clean trash bag
I took it sophomore year

DUDE that was stuck in my head the other day
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it weird how your eyelashes stop growing after a certain point
Rip my eyes ngl
i feel like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m overpacking way too much
Also isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it weird how we make up monsters and then get scared when they reveal themselves to us
I brought my tennis court shoes but forgot my racquet at home√¢≈ì¬®
And that means more room for more shit!
I have my lifting shoes, running shoes, basketball shoes, casual wear, sad that I had to leave behind my travis scott 1s :PES_Cry:
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even think abt shoes i just have crocs
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t own crocs
~~I had to leave behind like 10 pairs of shoes~~
Also isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it weird how we come up with monsters and then we get scared when we reveal them
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you say that already

chemistry is just so boring, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more memorization than almost anything else
Based ok the fact that I was just shooting a nerf gun with my friends yesterday and pretending to be shanked by a screwdriver and poured ketchup all over the floor pretending it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s blood I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think im ready for college level classes let alone chemistry
bold of you to assume college students don't do that

Idk
just get another class in there to have 12 idk
I see empty spots in a Chem 105 class but idk if you already saw that and it conflicts with ur other classes @rsgsockcheck
otherwise you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re part time which I think means you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live on campus, and I think if you have scholarships from the school or financial aid it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to the tuition the same way
Damn ü•≤

Rhode Island isn't bad

Literally what the fuck am I looking at
how r we supposed to know what group we're in
I think we find out from our orientation leader
I got an email at 4 PM one day from my orientation leaders introducing themselves and saying there would be a group meeting 4 hours later and I missed the meeting since I didn't see the email until 5 hours later üíÄ
FML
uhh i don't really check my email often either rip
that's fair
Even we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know our groups yet

A lot of their shit is overpriced
I dont think ppl stop using after a month
When did that happen
But Alex said that just means someone else will take it
Idk
If they arent anti Semitic, why did they choose to be born in a land that Israelis would want to take?
sorry disregard what I said
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgui√¢‚Ç¨ or √©¬¨¬º isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t particularly offensive it just means √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdevil√¢‚Ç¨ in the sense that the US government calls non-citizens √¢‚Ç¨≈ìaliens√¢‚Ç¨
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that LOL
Idk
Leaving for the land of the cleve tomorrow at 7am ü•∫

You need to accept Islam first
oh shit
Yeah but I never got the idea that he liked me
Oh, damn
Don't stress if someone dont like u
It dont matter
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what to do
It's just shocking because I put a lot of effort into making these relationships and them getting thrown back in my face even from 2 years ago is just cheeks
It's okay, it doesn't think Ziccardi is a word either
I completely understand that feeling, and I want to assure you that not all Chinese people are like that
my phone recognizes my last name because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a contact
iphone tingz
And honestly, one could argue its human nature to dislike an authority figure or just talk shit.
So don't take it personal
I think qiyuan is hard to approach üòÇ
I tried to fist bump him when we first met but he just stared at me blankly
@Deleted User when are you moving in
And honestly one could argue theyre not gonna help u with ur life or anything else, so as long as ur doing ur job and the right thing then it doesnt matter what they say, u dont need them and they dont need u
Ppl just run their mouth it aint worth getting mad

It's supposed to be perfect this weekend
Cold is far superior to hot
How is cold an allergen
idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually an allergy
my nephew would get allergy if there is humidity + cold
I just call it that bc ppl don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what cold urticaria is

after going thru the trauma that was my drive thru albany i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to respectfully disagree
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like heat
I would rather be staffed indoor somewhere sigh
I would like clouds though
Like no rain
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like the sun though
When you can literally feel yourself burning<<<<<<<
idk how people who tan do it
I mostly tan though
the feeling
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why i have a 7 hour car ride right?
go sleep
Idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cuz my body is still on California time but I def am not sleeping tonight
i'm too tired of googling what;s that :wearycritty:
I wish I could :Sadge:
folks it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s RAINING
you don't know what LUBE IS??
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s RAINING during THE DRY SEASON
idk english :fingerguns:
in california the dry season has lasted for the past 4 and a half years
when we talk about the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwet season√¢‚Ç¨ what we mean is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìit drizzled once three weeks ago√¢‚Ç¨
annie would you still kill me for a very small reward
I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t kill u but I would probably minorly assault u for like an ikea coupon
fair
Maybe you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean in that way but anyway
MOVING ON!
omf it is raining :(
we stopped in pa for the night
If you drove all the way you wouldn't have to be tired tomorrow
lol i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be tired tomorrow
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m moving in sunday tho
rip
omg me too
omg
i went to school in bergen
I'm so sorry you're from new Jersey
is the Midwest is better tho
Paramus but I went to hs in hackensack
I never pretend to think Lima is good though
It's not even close
my town has a boring name
we split from the neighboring town like 100 years ago and couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be more creative than just tacking √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwest√¢‚Ç¨ onto the existing name
guys this is tragic i think i forgot my wisdom teeth at home
I missed it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so tired of being on the road
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so tired
yet cannot sleep
i went to bed at 9:30 :) yet here i am
i am desperately trying to sleep :blurryeyes:
i am stopped i am just struggling
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m omw to the Orlando International airport
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m saying this but Imm get home sick for Florida
Imm miss you Florida :NM_peepoSalut:
Some old fuck on the plane took my seat and wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave
Wtf
just left homies
Tired
Waking up in 1 hour guys omg
or idk
I forgot to get travel insurance
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at the gate where my flight to Cleveland is supposed to be and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still used for ppl going to Fort Lauderdale
what airport is this
My shoulders are dying
How we supposed to print it out if we have no printer with us :cursed_flushed:
im gonna hope theyll scan my phone screen
you have to leave it on your dashboard I think
Yeah, do you think that they'll be able to snag a wild card? The Reds spanked the Phillies last night and are catching up to the Padres for WildCard
The Giants make me angry because they're good and they aren't supposed  good and yet they are
Boston has Devers and JD Martinez and Verdugo though
That's the wrong sport but yes one of those
I'm so disappointed in the Mets
Nothing gives me more joy than seeing the cubs be bad
and the pirates be bad
Blake Snell is trash outside of tampa though
I really have no clue as to what the problem is with the Mets. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been throwing in a lot of money to acquire superstars, yet they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to fix any of their holes. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve tried new players, coaches, etc and can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fix it.
Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t agree more
Lindor should have stayed in Cleveland though, he can't handle the big city pressure
And they traded for Baez and it's stupid to pay both of them
Cleveland has the same issue as Tampa. Budget. They couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t afford him anymore.
Cleveland doesn't have to have that issue though, the owner is just cheap
Bieber and Plutko are the only ones they need to keep
Tbh, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know Cleveland quite as well as I know most MLB teams, although with me flying into here last night, that will change.
They dodged a bullet by trading Clevinger though
But his covid violation issues were bad for team culture and he's so injury prone
Then I realized they went to my high school
idt anyone ever went to cwru before this year
someone else got in this year but
damn
Sad

aww man you missed the deleted convo

The exception is that I can't dance to King Julien üòî
I need this choreography asap :thiccnos:
i was just trying to vibe üò≠ üò≠
the audio is me explaining to @sir_sammy why i couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t zoom in any more
@chandachan it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bc of ur green shorts we could all find u really easily
i am tall :) and I hate it :)
I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY PUT IN THE WATER IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE MEN ARE LIKE ALL SIX FEET TALL
sorry we left early we desperately needed to shower
my knees hurt. so bad
and I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to doctors about this problem because they WONT BELIEVE MEE because until I actually need a wheelchair to locomote myself they will assume I am being Emotional and Overreacting
in the past I have been like I actually have chronic joint pain and theyre like no u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. exercise more
chronic pain check who else has chronic pain we do be vibin
I know someone with similar problems üòî
If u need legal opioids lmk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to use opioids fuck that I just want a doctor to actually belieeveee meeee
or like test for the thing that I literally have 100% of the symptoms of bc women don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know when pain is caused by a medical problem I guess
my mom is working on a diagnosis for the same problem. ppl take her seriously because she has been in pain for 30 years
if she gets a diagnosis then I will be able to get ppl to take me seriously
which to be fair to doctors most 18 year old girls don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
because essentially if I do have this (which I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m almost certain I do bc I have ALL the symptoms including the non-diagnostic ones) it would mean my body doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t produce enough collagen so it makes my skin tear really easily and my joints slide around and I heal WAY slower
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s basically like a diagnosis that will help me not be accidentally murdered or permanently disfigured if I need surgery because my body doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t react to medical procedures the way bodies are supposed to
I know self diagnosing medical disorders is like a bad idea generally. But also doctors think women lie about pain. So at some point you do have to self diagnose because you need to be able to advocate for yourself when ppl ignore u :tyrone: :tasha: :pablo: :uniqua:
anyway I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking Advil and hopefully then I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be able to sleep catch u later gamers remember doctors don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know everything :uniqua: :uniqua:
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s on the bottom end of the res village near wade

I just miss my mom :PES_Cry:

I haven't seen my parents in 2 and a half years Finn
I miss them
oh
bruh where do u work that ur boss makes 100000 times as much as u
√¢‚Ç¨¬¶it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still legal to fly to China???
China just closed their border so you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
oh
ur ceo doesnt even know who u are
And did China close the border on you?
then why havent u seen ur parents
Since they only just opened up
no he didnt fire me
he didnt rly care
do u know where i work?
i dont like restaurants
Where do u work @.fim.
Why not tho
i literally told u where my store was
Where r u really from?
Wtf I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at Taft what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ì3√¢‚Ç¨?
fuck off with this "where u really from" shit
Oh I went to the kosher barbecue at E. 115th
I can't come lol
Idk man, Leutner's got pretty ok food today
So you don't just fill up bottles
WTF U MEAN
Finn i thought u were PC
Wtf !
do u think people from different countries cant have kids?
idk a bunch of random shit
omg not even a real European
Thats all I wanted to know
FUCK U
cause that happens to be the 1/64th thats all the male parents
didnt the us take ur country too
nvm i forgot i actually knew which country u were from
Lmfao which arab country was taken by america
u probably should hold back on calling people sluts tho
idk like a few
there were some that were occupied but we never colonized them the way the UK did
we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t change their borders we just committed unsolicited war crimes it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s different
i mean the us didnt do much offial colinization
oh you mean puerto rico
They did Hawaii wrong üòî
oh you mean samoa
having non state territories is kinda sus tho
? fuck you
So I cant call u a hooker but u can say fuck u?
Its a fucking compliment
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bc if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a hooker then when he says fuck u it implies that it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t consensual bc you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re being forced into it by a man with complete control over your finances
im familiar with the concept i just dont understand ur paragraph
basically no need for districs
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what you just meant üòÇ
and none of the other problems with districts
Tbh ive never heard of this idea but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s definitely something
cause right now its bad cause of districts and jerrymandering and what if theres a group of people who should be represented by one congressperson but theyre spread over the country even tho they have similar values
ofc this will never happen cause it would involve disbanding congress
its solves more problems than just gerrymandering tho
like even without gerrymandering theres tons of problems inherent to the district voting system that this solves
thats like not very reliable tho
and it doesnt solve the other problems
I mean I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even really know what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m talking about so ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏
Idk what that is ü§¢
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never running for Congress üòÇ
im bad at public speaking tho
u need to like already be in a high position to get nominated for that tho
Money talks
Stop fucking making excuses and do shit @.fim. . Do u wanna be an anticappie or not.
wtf is that
Shatta the fuck up
I died
@.fim. fr tho shatta is arab hot sauce
sounds gross as fuck
fuck you
Facts don't care about my feelings
Wtf√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

Howdy why didnt u fucking say hi to me
OH

ive been on the phone with my bank for a total of 45 minutes today
IM SO HUNGRY
BUT I CANT WALK

gws tho
someone went like 25mph on their skateboard straight into my left ankle
i think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dying

@moseslee i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t met you yet

Couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be me
Really digging the short hair Zhanda
isn't it just the first one?
bc i am in so much pain
and rn my only option seems like walking
ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that
How much does it hurt
idk would he have like
what happened
ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ idk but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what ur other options are
someone like doggy style fucked my ankle with a skateboard today
idk who to tellüò≠üò≠
but i still can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t walk
or would people get mad
Idk if you can @everyone
u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t unless admin
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ping
:droidcry: :droidcry: it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an emergency idk
oh is that a stocker
No you just type it but it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ping anybody
but idk how i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna get there
i mean i have a car
which is kinda just as bad
i feel bad tho
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel bad
aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we not supposed to
ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ I mean u said it hurts to walk so
oh
idk
ra on call is just if u need smt right fucking now
@caileeee do you got like ice or some shit
then it wouldnt hurt anymore
lots of things dont seem that bad at the time
my dad shattered his wrist once while biking cause a woman almost hit him with her car and he had to swerve and fell over but he said it was fine when she asked cause it didnt start hurting bad till like 15 mins later
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been using a cold water bottle to ice it üò≠üò≠
You potentially need crutches
Try cold compresssss for nowww to easen it up a bit
so u dont need to use ur feet at all
You want a piggy back ride or sumn?
Okay just rest rn and just keep ice or smth cold on the area where it hurtsss, when the pain eases, wrap your ankle with something but not too tight, and keep it elevated when u sleep tonight with a pillow or smth
so my ra said he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have anything
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like almost 11 PM there rn? :crii:
just fyi this all happened at like 5pm today
That doesn't mean you shouldn't deal with it at all
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bus stop outside of the dunkin
except idk how to take the bus
and get out when you get to where you need to
altough idk if they're still enroute at this hour
but you need help getting to the bus station?
We stand for the flag and if you don't like it

@kaori_flute i just tried sittoos shawarma
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably looking at zach doing work rn
And u didn't say nothing
Jkjk we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
You didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get us in
What the hell am I supposed to put here
What times ur available to work during the week
Ok so do I just write down on a doc hours I'm available?
So if u have classes till 2 pm on Monday for example u put im available 3 pm-11 pm
Shit like that
And then upload the doc
i mean u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t necessarily have to put ur availability down as every single hour u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have class
bc u still want some free time
do u really wanna work that much
i mean u won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t necessarily get scheduled for all that
I don't got a life dawg
but i think u should put aside some time for homework
homework
studying
student workers can only work 20h a week
oh fr?
that sucks
ig it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually matter if students can only work 20
so u def won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get scheduled all the time
working past like 8 or 9 is poopoo
I can't study during the day
Damn I really did just submit my application
Yea they won't necessarily schedule u every hour u are available
I can't remember where I left it
I forgot to laugh
That was me, except you caught me in the middle of the worst day I've had all year
do they have spicy chicken tho?
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so
i know i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have class for 2 of my classes but is it like a school holiday or is just by instructor discretion
Fair enough
You shouldn't eat this close to lifting
Theres no line

Oh
This line kinda long tho 
NVM my friends meal card isn't even activated yet
Im so mad I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t test into a class that I literally already took and passed with an A
should√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just taken the stupid ap lmao
oh shit u cant even take 121?
the problem is I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m far too ADD to be able to complete a test correctly
yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fucking mad bc I literally am 2 classes ahead of 121 >:0
RIP
that feels like a lot of work tho I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably just brush up on calc this semester and test into 122 and act like nothing happened
that'd be stupid if they made u take it all over again
honestly yeah that doesnt sound too bad to have an easy class first semester
I was really mad earlier but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve calmed down now maybe I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll tutor as a side hustle and make a MILLION DOLLARS
I gotta do that too, lmk later in the semester if you want to do a study group
For which one? I took MATH121
I think the 3 hour ones aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t out yet

There's something else that's different about Jackson's offseason, though. Jackson said he's happy for his new teammates to have a chance to get back to full health √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù something he has to do on a regular basis as he continues to prove that he can turn a team around.

@Deleted User I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to come for the movie tonight sorry
didn't ppl dissappear on your land or sum shit idk
All the Communist forces in Russia went on to fight the war on Russia in the 1887, 1918, and 1930's (the latter two years being the most difficult year in Russia history!), they had a huge advantage over their American counterparts because if Russia could get to the point of the US forces leaving and the Russians had the ability to fight back, it would make very little difference to the US wars. So even if Russia had only won the Soviet Union a huge amount of money from foreign capitalists and foreign banks, it would mean something to all those countries that were fighting for the US to help Russia and to help the USSR, not to mention all the other countries that were fighting for the US too. So it didn't surprise me when the Bolshevik Revolution became the center of Russian affairs, there was a very strong push for the Bolshevik government within Russia when Communism was only supported through the Communist Party of Russia (POC). The Communist Party of Russia was founded and organized by Lenin in 1934. This party was also not simply a "political" organization but rather, what I call an individual socialist revolutionary party, that made up of workers and peasants and also people who all spoke Russian and thought like them. The Communist Party of Russia was only partially founded due to the fact that many of its members, in order to get access to this leadership and also to create a party for their own political interests, were actually Communists. In some way, this was "communism" as
Omg
@howdy_. is a bigot tho
holy shit you're right
@tsunderratedd where did u find that

Isnt calc 1 only taught by butler
Apparently not
Go ask her for help and she will show you how to approach the math problem
She likes to walk around the class room without shoes and socks on. I like to call her foot fungus.
Wtf
I personally don't like her because her style of teaching is a bit rushed but she is nice when she wants to be
If you do office hours, try to go to her alone or with one other person because she isn't good at handling a large group and getting everyone's questions lol
She usually will focus on just 2 people for a majority of time.
I had her this summer 
Oh, and don't be late. She likes to shit talk about you if you're late in any type of way
There was an accident on the freeway and I was like 15-20ish minutes late and she said that the accident shouldn't be an excuse albeit i was almost in the accident. So uh, don't be late.
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see you

I overheard the guy saying that they got sent death threats
Trump alone has just completely tarnished the republican name unfortunately
I mean I think the hate groups and flamboyant racists also had something to do with it
and that they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want trans people to get equal treatment
I think a lot of this stuff really ties with conservative republicans, which a lot of them are, there are still progressive republicans who do advocate for these issues but unfortunately get drowned out by the conservatives
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just saying that we need to revamp the Democrat booth next year
I'm half I think it counts
Wtf is a progressive republican
Im a fuck lenin type commie
I wish I could've gone hhh

I think im half commie
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s almost like communist countries were actually fascist dictatorships and ppl still think that communism is fascism even though it literally is not
Do u need me to elaborate
club would probably collapse before the end of the school year :KEKDisco:
Sweden isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exactly socialist
obama read the manifesto to oppress white people this is so sad üòû
So how long till this country is communist

My 65 yr old coworker that told me Jesus was her vaccine said after biden got elected that this country would be communist
R u telling me shes wrong

Fuck u alex
my body can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even digest soy and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still a communist
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think trans ppl shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be allowed to have health care√¢‚Ç¨
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that√¢‚Ç¨
compromise? :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed:
im very left leaning
all minorities should only be given half of their rights because otherwise the republicans will never work together with us :uniqua: :uniqua:

I just dont wanna try
unless he wants to test us on calc I as well
then sorry i don't remember anything
I'm considering not doing math 122
bc it seems a little above me
Can't u withdraw by the end of the semester if its not for u?
but also I've only had one class and a test
I'm gonna see how I feel after first two weeks
bc I'd love to take the hard math class
but if I'm gonna be lost the whole time, then I'd rather learn less things and actually learn them
i don't know where i stand on this anymore tbh
i like math
math is hella complicated
i never toured there sooooo

I don't want to take a physics final, AP was enough

Don't get pinzas
did anyone have their phys 121 lab yet
people from chem labs couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any skin showing so i wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sure
Yea prob cuz it's a Chem lab
i wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sure if physics would be the same :crii:
The bees never leave me alone
I won't be able to goooooo üò≠üò≠üò≠
Idk but I regularly handle 12 molar HCl and pyrophorics so I think PPE is pretty important
No pain no gain
What doesnt kill you makes you stronger
What doesn't make you stronger kills you
Chemicals cant hurt you if you dont believe in them
They are playing sad boi music at Leutner

B-but studying ü•∫
@alexthedawg tryouts isn't that bad
me when my chem competence assessment determines that I have mastered 42/44 relevant math and physics skills but only 12/38 relevant skills in reactions and thermochemistry
52% of all of my chemistry skills are in physics and math, so more than half of all my chem knowledge is not actually chemistry
im literally just doing as much rn as i can so i dont have to do as much later
Wtf nsfw√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
get back to work :CheemsBaguette:
Isnt that a star wars planet?
it's not juniper tho
Oh
@alexthedawg fuck u

Damn nvm
Very helpful when you're trying to email someone but you don't know their email address üòÖ
Why can't I have that name :LAUGHING:
Wtf
Find me üòÜ
Wtf
I don't
It's designed for if u wanna mail someone, back in the days
This is dangerous low key, you can find someone's exact room too
If you want to rob someone, go to your local sex offender registry to find the address. They legally cannot own any guns
but it wont let me change it
Both work
oh ü•≤
Does anyone want to go to west side market on Saturday?
I want to go Mr Robin
how do u communicate out loud without using language? do u release beeps in morse code
I just realized I took all my notes on my iPad, and I can't bring it to class smh ü§¶√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏
Which class?
Why can't you bring it to class?
Aria, you are scaring me. all my shit is digital
anyone know if there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s testing at wade still?
for three weeks since Orientation Week
Can't remember the times, sadly... But yes
does anyone here have a car
and would be willing to take me to the airport next friday night
bc i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to uber
bc i am scared of uber
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there a train you can use?
oh there is
actually no i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have time for that
bc my last class ends at 3
and my flight leaves at 5:30
Damn that's a short amount of time
Usually you should get to the airport at least 3 hours in advance @caileeee
Just skip class
flight is enough proof
2 hours for domestic
3 hours for international
my mom was flight attendant this is what she told me
i feel like 3 hours early for a 1 hour flight is overkill
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really need to skip class
if i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find someone to drive me
I went 4 hours in advance for mine
@caileeee the rta red line goes straight to the airport
@kaori_flute i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sitting in math 122 rn
on a bench near moca
then left after everyone was peer pressuring me to stay
fuck peer pressure
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not my class
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to be there
christ has died, christ is risen, christ is to the fifth power
to answer your question, idk
do we even have another recitation?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m an hour early to class now
i wasn't paying that much attention tho
Watching Chris do math makes me realize how shit at math i am
there is no reason anybody should do math like him
I originally didn't do blue bc I thought too many people were blue
shit

I still haven't cut my nails
typing is getting annoying

bruh i didn;t get the ping
also sorry not sorry y'all saw me in that state, today is a hot day :fingerguns:
i miss my babygirl :(
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have time to take it tho
do u have to go right after class or smt
its not even that much slower than going by car
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still asleep
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just like i feel safer going in uber or car bc idk how to use the train here
so if i end up like taking the wrong one or whatever then i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll miss my flight
kinda don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna risk that
ig? idk its pretty easy i feel like
i would rather spend money on uber to make sure i make the flight and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t waste $300 instead
Now I understand why some ppl say they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t breathe with a mask on
damn y'all got a quiz already?
are they short quizzes based on your readings? @_s.k
simply dont get sweaty 5head
just dont sweat
i dont relaly perspire
for drool, get masks that don't come in contact with your mouth
sweat yeah like howdy and jen said
unless im doing strenuous cardio, i dont really sweat that much
sucks to suck :blobcri:
Put the mask over your mouth, not your nose @.littlejimmy
if u wanna avoid that
just don't exercise
or just go outside and dont wear it üß†
cuz its what I do when im working out
I can't go and not hurl on the table
Oh
All existentialism converges on "When I'm dead, just throw me in the trash." - Danny Devito as "Frank" (Always Sunny)

You get expelled and then they murder you in cold blood
I got tested today but I didn't even think about it until Thursday

We get vaccinated and still have to wear these muzzles
Jen is getting pissed

DONDA isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just an album üíø , it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a cultural reset üó∫ , a reason to breathe ü•µ , an escape from this cruel world filled with thieves ü•∫ . It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s art üñº , the first gift üéÅ you open on xmas üéÑ , a hug ü§ó from a loved one ü•∞ , everything you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever wanted ü•≥ , everything you need √¢‚Äî
Just listened to #DONDA , currently lost for words man, I am crying real tears, this is quite possibly the best album i have ever heard. I struggle to find a single negative element of this album. Kanye has done it again.
Shaking and crying rn @therealoj32
Oh my fucking God ur not lying
Kanye has me shaking right now, he's in my head, my ears are being blessed. When I go to sleep I hear DONDA, when I eat I hear DONDA, this album has captivated and completely changed my life. Nothing will happen greater than this album so life ends here.
Calc hw is fucking me up ü•≤ @100kstarsun

I haven't started on chapter 7 either
Also I just realized I have to do the practice problems üôÉ
How are we all behind already
at least i don't need to take many notes from the textbook
The problem isn't that I'm behind (I'll catch up eventually) it's that my labs haven't even started yet and I'm already struggling to keep up üò¢
Nope just practice problems
i should mayhaps drop a class
idk
idek anymore
dont give up
i haven't processed much info
Also if you drop 323 I don't think 223 is much better; in fact, it looks/feels like it's worse

Ah yes. the two worst sports

theres no class if you don't go
if it works the way phys 121L does, you have lab this week if you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t last week. if you had lab last week you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t this week.
Oh okk that makes sense. But is it like phys 121 tho?
Nah I asked a question and the owner was like "idk imma leave" then transferred ownership to me

Words that won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t last long

Horseradish isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t an instrument either
THEY DONT HAVE BREAKFAST FOOD SUDDENLY

Shit slaps hard
Too late I ate@Deleted User
Dude I'm not even working tonight üò≠üò≠ I had band
I'm working tomorrow basically all day
and driving to work
Pain living most of my life in places with perfectly functioning public transit systems
That doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist here
left is gas, right is break
I failed my last driving test cuz the car can't do
probably an issue w the car
They didn't like that
Pop quiz: What do you do if the stoplight at in intersection is broken or off?
Then it doesn't exist
okay but idk what yes has to do with this
they dont blink
that sucks
most the side ones tho just aare out
Yea ive never heard of the blinking ones either
i think blinking isnt a power issue but like a dif issue
like if the light isnt working
but not cuz of out of power
there was a major intersection where a light when out and no one knew what the fuck to do bc ohioans are bad drivers (sorry not sorry) and there were cops who drove past the intersection that just didnt gaf
ohioans are shit at driving sorry not sorry
euclid drivers are bad
I think Italians are the worst drivers ive ever seen
they just turned their lights on to go through
new jersey are worst
Like rome n shit
I have less than 10hr in a car
Idk man
You havent seen italian highways like i have
Fair enough
I just refuse to believe a group of people can be worse than pickup truck drivers
they either drive hella slow
to the hospital for example
@Deleted User what is the sages paper thing we are supposed to be working on? I can find the details on what we are supposed to be doing
i just hurt my nail really bad
Have you tried turning it off and on again
it didnt work
We are supposed to write an argument about one of the poems we have been given. 2-3 pages and has to be arguable 
That's about it

Apparently 20 is the normal
I'll review it for you if you want @jellieellie
Something wrong
buh bye :NM_Wave:
...to some, lmao what a fucking shit album

oh my god my math teacher writes her qs curving backwards so i walked in for the quiz this morning like "what the FUCK is an eg'n"
i was like i dont know what that is i cant do that
OH NO
*oh*
every time chrks writes asin on the board I get so scared
i lost a point because I did 2 + 1/2 = 3/2
I almost lost a point bc I forgot a negative sign, but I had enough time to double check all my answers
true tho
i lost a point on my last math quiz because i did 26 + 26 + 10 = 72
i got as far as 52 + 10 = 72
theres a guy in the front who keeps reacting to everything chris says
you don't know what he's up to outside of class
man I really don't pay attention in class
i don't remember that at all

Permutation and combination kinda killing me rn ngl
i just ate half my body weight in cheese it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s now i think i will die
me writhing on my floor battling the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worst stomach ache
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW WHEN TO USE COMBINATION AND WHEN TO USE PERMUTATION
WHY IS THIS SHIT SO FUCKING CONFUSING
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
I have crack if u need @.littlejimmy
Math 125 moment
PERMUTATION WHEN ORDER MATTERS COMBINATION WHEN IT DOESNT
shut the fuck up take it back right now fuck you
I have some if u want
Like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d legitimately drink it even if it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a preworkout
@_s.k hates me confirmed
Imagine doing data science instead of chad computer science
So if I shove a grape up my booty hole, it ferments and becomes wine and gets absorbed by my body the exact moment that I hit someone with my car, is that a DUI or not
If I force someone to eat an oreo, they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t try to press charges or anything, they decide to let me off the hook, but then, they throw up on a bus due to nausea from the oreo causing the driver to black out and thus causing an accident, am I guilty here?
If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tongue kissing someone and my tongue curls up and hooks on to said person√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s newly planted gold crown tooth and pulls it into my mouth, is that a felony theft?
Assuming I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve walking on the street and a pregnant woman starts to give birth, the baby√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s upper half comes out, stabs me with a knife, and goes back in, is that attempted murder or no?
doesn't attempted murder require intentionality? cus if so then you'd have to argue that the newborn had an intention to murder, and idk if youd even be able to establish that the baby has an understanding of the world much less an intention to kill another person
If I go to the bathroom and accidentally clog the drainage for the entire building, and someone else uses the bathroom and drowns in shit, is that an accidental drowning or is it negligent homicide on me?
Wtf did I walk I to
typed in the answer wrong twice üòÇ
Can't tell
....but you like yeezus so fuck u
what the fuck happened here
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a bad thing :copege:
And Ik toilet 4 doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t flush unless you hold the thingy down for like 10 seconds
Ima guess plumbing issue
fun fact: the left door in my bathroom opens if the other door closes so you have to reclose the door if someone gets in the other one
Well I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna guess plumbing bc it would be really hard to not notice (twice) that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve totally missed the toilet and like it would probs smell terrible
Just the face tho from like the mouth/nose up
I can't imagine a basketball player showering in there
tall people problems
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m almost 6√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to duck
Granted I let the water hit my neck and not the top of my head but still
Freshman showers were pain for me
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do so hot on it tho
i missed a question
Turns out when you the y part of the equation is zero you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually need to put it because it counts it wrong
Lmao I think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I missed a few questions
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rewritten my notes yet tho
And that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna happen tmrw lol I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t focus today
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to I already do :aPES_LulLaugh:
but that's unpleasant cold :0
the closer shower in the bathroom without the tub just
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always hair on the walls and I hate it
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drain properly
Oh our washer and dryers are surely broken
One of our stoves is broken
Our fridge moves when we open the door
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still wet
Holy shit I totally forgot

People don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what a fucking lint trap is
college dorms

Bad internal connection?

It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up in the bios either
I was looking at myself in the mirror today and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so glad I stuck with my 3 month long cut @zackt7718
Probably a bad SSD
Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m lowkey looking forward to my cut
3 more months of bulking tho
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to go on a dirty bulk and gain 5lb of fat per 1 lb muscle
Nooooo don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dirty bulk man have willpower brother
I hate my hair rn it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s way too short
@.littlejimmy 100% recommend working out at Veale
My hair is short why tf would I want a haircut
Veale is so far away :PES_Cry:
You just go into a workout like ice cold bro?

@Deleted User what time are u working tmrw
@Deleted User fam u got aired how u feel

i have one class today
Oscar going unnoticed seems to have  become an unfortunate theme
i knew it was you i was just anxious about being wrong üòî
I dont want to go
It got so cold suddenly
me when i cry in yost
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good place to cry
nord is not a good place to cry
would never cry in nord
Only good place to cry is in my head bc stoicism
but yeah yost is small and there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a lot of light coming in so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good place to cry
Ready to fail this quiz?
oh no i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cry over the quiz
oh no
dont cry
i wish it were that ez for me
So don't grieve for too long
Yes u need to go thru all of them in a short time

ty tho :frogheart:
I was making a list using their followers of people who I never want to talk to
bad
They deadass want to go to Planned Parenthood and try to council people out of getting abortions
the consequences of getting an abortion after r*pe is worse than the actual consequences of r\*pe
there is no longer separation of church and state in our country
So if I took one this morning I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to again next week?
That geo test was harder than my math test no cap
But that should be the last of the 3 week testing
If you miss all 3 weeks, you can take it 3 times in 1 day to make up for it
oh so it's the first 3 weeks of classes and not 3 weeks on campus?
I don't think the move-in test counted toward the 3 weeks but honestly it can't hurt to just get one next week
office of whatever the fuck that is in charge of this : "naughty kittens get punishments for not taking their COVID tests"
realistically probably nothing
yeah there's some form of disciplinary action but i honestly don't know what they could do in this situation
yeah i almost forgot to get my second test lol
What if I just don't get tested this week
what if you missed a week so you did monday and friday the next week
Through some channels I know last year they were paying about 2 million dollars a month for the mass testing and rapid results
we only pay them how much each year?
yeah but now everyone will be scrambling to fit into the times left
It really is not difficult
i spit slow i guess?
its not that bad, I went at 5pm to PBL yesterday and there was no line
they didnt really tell us until recently
or at least i didnt notice
There was an announcement abt it last week from yours truly
make sure you dont eat/drink/chew gum/anything 30 mins before hand
fair
does it count as food tho
do not consume 30 mins before
what if you dont consume it
What if you have someone else's spit in your mouth?
i think i deleted most of those emails though because my inbox was crowded
bruh they cant expect us to click through things
i did that when they sent the email saying "DO NOW OR DIE"
@jellieellie idk if you wanna add that to your announcement ^
uni is a bit of a scam tho
lol 529 my bad
but then if you add the money spent outside of school
idk my parents decided for me
no links = no scam therefore links = scam and scam = no money and no money = poor and poor = no food and no food = dead therefore links = dead
fair
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a credit card
oh damn
I don't have a credit card either
getting a credit card was one of the first things i did when i turned 18
i have one in my dads name so it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t affect my credit score
that's supposed to be "big" purchases?
you don't
I'm getting my license renewed this winter when I go back to Florida

it's pass/fail all you have to do is sit for 50 minutes a week and write a page about it?
but british english is worse
fair
I haven't experienced enough british english to form an opinion on it
i like to watch when I'm bored
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a homie working out at Wyant looking ~~very submissive and breedable rn~~

Less problems would exist
Oscar dont be shy fuck that shit up dawg üò≠
What is up with this tiktok trend where people make themselves like cars with the years and previous owners and shit bruh :weirdchamp:
You be slamming weights in the gym but r scared to get food
Nah cuz like when I do dumbbell press I literally cannot put them back down gently so I have to slam them and I feel so bad about it
And also when I squat cuz I be breathing like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m taking my last breathe and I get so self conscious about it
Don't say goodbye smell you laterrrrrrrrr
Dawg its stuck in my head
Wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t yoga invented in like India
I legit can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deadlift without the hexbar
Jenin. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to trigger your PTSD 

Have you started the physics HW yet
Can't believe they assigned hw over break
What about u tho
to whoever moved my stuff out of the washer after 2 minutes of it staying there just so you could wash a single item when there were other washers already open: sincerely, fuck you √¢¬§√Ø¬∏

Dude I wish Lenin was still alive
Shhhh don't tell anyone
Omg I should work out when I have a fever
Too bad I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m alone :NM_PeepoCryDrink:
I legit did that last year when I had a fever
Well your volume and intensity won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be the same as usual so no
Chat died
dont u mean less conspicuous
Sure
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not in my dorm today tho :fingergun:
I don't know what ur insinuating @_the_intern_
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat chocolates and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat candy except for gummies bc they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re good post workouts
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just wrong T_T
mmm ok fair point
dont eat what u dont like tasting
I can't have chocolate bc allergic qwq
never bring this man to insomnia cookies
And I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they have the breed I like here in the US
firbley plums are kind of weird tho
Plum bad
If it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not crunchy I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want it
If you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat bananas that are 50% green
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re wrong
lads i've been trying to formulate this bread recipe for the last 1.5 hours and failing because of discord
Hun
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re wrong in everything that is food
omg
omg
i never wake up this late
don't steal my melatonin gummies!
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a hormone not drug so it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter how much you take really
taking too much can cause damage to your own like personal melatonin production
Bruh why does Leutner only open till 8
L3 grill is open till 10
this one dude grabbed his box and ran
First of all I am not in Norton anymore
Second of all, that totally seems plausible, I remember of a similar incident occurring in the basement of KSL last year
speaking of KSL

Darnit, I wanted to come
OMG
Ooh is the play that goes wrong open yet?
A bunch of amateur theater students try to put on a play but they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all terrible
we got
physics, logic design, data structures and math to study
And the set keeps breaking
it'd be funnier if it were some high school kids trying to act
at least you don't have a deadline
so you can spend your time dreading this coming wednesday instead
And I gotta do my OChem HW that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s due by Wednesday
In the play they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re supposed to be college kids in a theatre club
What lab report do we have there wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t one for part 1
:CB_angery_cry: do home work
I legit have zero clean clothes sue me
Yeah what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong with wearing glasses Jenin
Wow looks like someone won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be getting help on the next physics HW √¢‚Ç¨¬¶
i'll go stare at a screen for 5 hours and have to wear glasses
i hate when my pills start on sunday cuz then i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get to put the fun sticker on them :(
ily hannah i won't say simp anymore

Look at this sick fucking synergy I had with a total random
sir i ain't no bloody 'mewican

That entire state seems funky
Well yeah you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count on one hand how many confederate flags you drive by on I-95S
mhm time to find a study space see y'all soon :Heartsbmulti:
Me when Israel no longer exists
Do your work

so much work has already piled up :pocky_ef_sob:
I fr need Beth

bro i haven't talked to her in forever

my brain is fried and i feel like i'm going to fail the quiz :sobeautiful:
No no u got it, failure isn't an option üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ

When does it end?
Gia u can still come we have like 20 people here
Oh my
Didn't u say ur sensitive to caffeine ur gonna quite literally shit urself
Thats good tho I guess
Didnt buy it
Pre workout aint for you then my G
that should be enough to last you for 1 1/2 months to 2 depending how often you workout
Oh
I don't know what a word says
I don't know the middle word
You sure you ain't dead yet
135g isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t much at all
Nah doesn't make sense in this context
Darn it why can't I figure out what I wrote
oh you wrote this? üò≠
idk what AP is and what's acting as it so this probably isnt helpful üò≠
It just stands for action potential, I'm just lazy and didn't write out the whole word
for what class?
I saw two girls trying to get into wyant without swiping
I tried to tell them to swipe but they ran from me
math 227 :dead:
no one is a tutor for math 227
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in 223 and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already too much ü•≤
cuz i enjoy pain
Where all the 223/227 homies cus we should form a study group
this one girl in my study group for 227 im convinced she hates me :(
Half the people in my 227 have already taken the class ;-;
How :0 I wasn't by ugly
Was I walking with someone?
HIs nickname is literally Izen the Terrible
He can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even spell his own name correctly smh
i just wish it wasnt a self-taught class
I thought 227 was already very difficult until I realized I did like 3 weeks of homework in the first week
omg
are u in my. class
Tbh 227 with izen is kinda fun (if u like math üò∂) it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just ez to get lost during the lec if u take a second too long writing smth down or trying to process a concept
Like dawg I lost the syllabus
everything is on his website 
except for announcements
LMFAO i didnt know preciate it
math121
holy shit the exam is coming up
i'm suffering like you in math122
actually it's worse is calc2 is more difficult
literally i b saying that when im bout to take an exam i didnt study for
dawg i was late to class the other day and  missed the quiz
they are
and if you feel you need more practice
chris has assigned book problems in the syllabus
go to office hours if you feel you need them
even if it were for one question
i have to make it a habit cuz dude some shit doesnt make sense
ru7 3al office hours
lmaoooooo u right im just still used to covid school bs :/
don't think
get used to going there even if you don;t have questions
just go there and do work in general
dude im still mad at drew for that last lecture kal "were gonna go a bit faster to catch up because of labor day"
we did not have labor day last year so drew a5ad ra7to
i forgot to do aleks
always finish aleks one week before it's due
@Deleted User use today and tmw to catch up as much as possible
if you're always caught up with MPODs (aka getting all the questions right) and have all you chem stuff (including revising your notes and having Aleks done 1 week b4 it's due)
things will go so much more smoothly
don't procrastinate on this small stuff
cuz in these 2 classes, too many small stuff = suffering
Have you started physics HW yet
@.littlejimmy I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave you on read bb ü•∫
Cuz dude mish fahimmm
no
i can try helping if you want :pikathink: can't guarantee i remember but will try
3ammo no that won't work
oki npnp
if you want, you can send me the problems in the meantime
~~i can also look them up just tell me which MPOD~~
jokes aside
idk

There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this fucking beast of a man at Wyant rn deadlifting 495 for like 8 reps or sumn
ü•ö ed as fuck
I probably saw you if you came in the past few weeks
Yea definitely, tho I been skipping quite a bit last few weeks
look out for the Asian girl with a buzz cut at the front desk
I don't have a smart car
Only if I put a laptop in it and swap it with a 5.7 liter hemi
This slander feels like the words of somebody without a car
But I don't even have a driver's license yet
Wtf is with people being 20 years old and not having a license
Totally didn't realize I actually need to drive
Did you not think of how maybe you'd get to your plane
I've been saving since 2018 for a car and I had to choose between this civic or a 2012 mustang
Also don't blame me, blame the fact that I never needed one for most of my life
wanted that mustang
Can't relate #cornville
There aren't even sidewalks where I live
There aren't even sidewalks in the neighborhood
Also by Ohio law, since I'm 21 and have been driving for more than 3 years I'm legally able to teach you how to drive
Based upon my time driving in IL the only laws are "cut people off whenever possible" and "the horn is actually an accelerator for other people's cars"
also don't signal ever
every pothole you hit, your car loses ~500$ of its market value
Idk if anybody here is from wisconsin but their state highway patrol have black cars and those mfs were some creative hiders
I was in Indiana all weekend and the two things I hate about driving there are: 
1. The speed limits are all 10 to 15 mph slower than Ohio
2. They have unmarked cars EVERYWHERE
I'm very serious
All u need
My fell depressed horny gymbros
I still don't get the whole horny thing but I guess I'm built different
What I heard pianos r supposed to sound worse with time, but the feel and dynamic range of those r still crazy good
For the only instrument that's supposed to sound better with time, I don't even believe it does
it also apparently has to do with the sap
I don't really like their sound though tbh, they're too dark for my ears
most likely because I've spent so much time trying to hone my ears mixing stuff
But a violin is never going to sound as dark as a bassoon, after all its still a violin
Man I wish I have some nice violins to show u
uh oh
I just dont want to get it stolen or damaged
Fuck music tho
I stopped listening to music for a few months already
No regrets, would do longer
I stopped playing after high school lol
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see the point since I knew I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bringing it here
I used to use a gold plated G but I stopped
Was really expensive tho since you have to keep replacing them
Tho unfortunately her violin hardly appreciated over the yrs, I would call that a purchase mistake, relatively speaking
Oh damn I never studied others√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ instruments
I found what I liked and stuck with it ahah
Yeah whenever I tried violins I chose the loud ones lol
Oh rip
A British guy is supposed to write me a certificate next week
Wtf
Idk all of my certificates are at home
Visited them twice, going again in a few weeks
Oh T2
I sold one on it 2 months ago
Not a Bazin tho
Oh is it an old instrument or
Keep an eye on hill bows too, they r a steal for the price atm
Hope u didn't pay tooo much for them
Oh u only have one, sorry I misread
Idk the other one we only know it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s from mittenwald
I like them tho
They r easily recognized, but it gets harder trying to attribute it to a specific family member
Bruh idk
I've seen shitty shops trying to sell a "klotz school" as a sebastian
Damn
Too bad I don't think I'll ever take my good violin back to Cleveland
It's staying in NY until it's sold
Oh u didn't bring it to school?
Nope
This is a really old image. I stopped using the chin rest thing ages ago
I think this image was taken from the website
Caused a shit ton of shoulder tension
The setup looks very good, tho I can't quite see where the graft is
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a lot of pics of it rip
Won't be surprised if it's original
Lemme show you the lion head tho
Not bad
I kept this one at my middle school
Gosh shouldn't be spamming main like this
Eh I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be bothered lol
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s spam or dead
My other purchases r all sad mistakes so
Damn okay
Oh rip
I don't typically tell Klotz owners how much I think their instruments r worth cuz
We got mine for less than the guy wanted to sell it for
He listed the price wrong on the website by a couple grand
And even if the instrument doesn't worth much in itself, the face that u picked one up that's been very well restored and setup
Fair
Yea not bad
DAMN 20k
Oh gross
We haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sold anything yet
No the horrible arching on it is beyond salvageable, "they all sound like a trumpet" said a dealer friend
I'm glad I didn't lose any money on it
I hate it when they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re screechy
Not like they were trying to let me sell cheap
If u can put a name on ur Kloz u may be able to get the 8k back, don't think there's too much space for appreciation yet
Oh I found a copy of a bow certificate
Oh not bad
One more than the other tho
Oh sick my Bazin is also certified by raffin
But again for the price point if u ever want another one keep an eye on hills
This always makes me so sad. The colored winding undid in the mail
I tried to we had it redone without the colors
They apparently don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that anymore
Except for the hair
Oh
U had it redone but it's still the original?
Wtf how many bazins do u have
And the other one I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like to use but has the original parts
Personally I would sell both and buy a sartory but obviously don't take a dealer's opinion
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I would consider it unless we really needed the money
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been so long since we got it ahah
Luckily I'm a shitty violinist so I don't really care how something plays
Oh bob my bad
im trying to install my artist tablet drivers
wtf
I know absolutely nothing that could help you rn tho
oh wtf
Nm heh was studying bio and got really sidetracked
Oooof don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get too sidetracked now :howdy_hattip:
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been studying most of the weekend so I need the break tbh
U used the howdy emoji, someone will show up by ur room tonight
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sleep on a bed :LAUGHING:
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem as threatening if you have a roommate
Jk, but I used it all the time and no one hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t showed up yet üòå
Oo plane
I wanna go buy some graphic tees for the gym but I ain't dropping 25 bucks on urban outfitters
it takes 15 mins for cars
just dont miss the shuttle back :crii:
nah I'm good dawg üò≠  I got a geology paper that I just found out I have an hour ago
that's just wrong
due tomorrow before class
He didn't tell us
He doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it Jenin
it is not that bad
oh-
i like it when they go zoomzoom tho
I would take the RTA more often if I'm not going alone
I argue that One Piece is arguably one of the worst, if not the worst main stream anime
isn't that your floor?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢M SO SCARED
they can't even bite really
I don't like the roaches but I like the cock
honestly with cockroaches you're better off trying to catch them and throw them outside then killing them
if you kill them you have to clean it up
oh shit my favorites are gone too
I caught a roach with my hand, and handed it to my coworker once
I always feel bad killing them
Yk what actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it might be into that shit
this video refuses to leave my fucking recommended section
yet if I open youtube, sure enough
mutht I really thlam my penith in the car door for it to thtop?
Caught him venting down bad in 4K
I feel like shit
I hate 8 ams
i hate. 8 am
can't do this shit no mo
I went to bed at 12 and I need my fucking sleep
idk how i used to leave the house by 5:45 for high school
I like how peaceful the campus is in the morning so I wake up early
It does mean I sleep earlier than most
Fr tho it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s quiet and kinda dewy outside
I just want to
late
and wake up late
And then next year if I don't die from this year Imm have to start waking up at 3
So it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s possible to avoid the early classes
I tried to do 19 and my navigator said no
I got to my 8am class 10 mins early and then my prof sent an email that our class actually starts at 9:40 today ü§°
I don't
My stress has been getting bad again lol
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been picking at my skin ugh
I have no idea where my fidget things were after we moved so I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bring any
I lift and I can't be eating 24/7
Fair
Yesss I went once but it was so packed
Forgot what it was called
I keep forgetting that next year I still need to fucking live on campus
But we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be in freshman dorms so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m hoping it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be as bad
Nah fuck that no ac = bad
Oh
The American judicial system always favors the woman in terms of divorce so it literally doesn't matter
You see I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been divorced so I assumed it was just paperwork
I guess you should get the prenup then
If I paid for my dorm but lived in an apartment instead would the school know
Idk my friend's doing that acktuallie
I guess if you pop in often enough people will assume you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just really social?
My RA is apparently never around so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna wonder where I am
I just want to not have to go to the bathroom and always take 2 strips of tp on the bathroom seat
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen that yet actually
They wouldnt care, you already paid them the money for the dorm, aka the reason they require housing
Yeahh so rip
Guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m staying in the dorms
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad since I have a single
The bathroom will always be the worst part
They dont stop you
Rip
Otherwise idk what LOB means
i need to get out of bed :NkoLost:
I need coffe
sometimes my jaw moves out of its socket and then when i close my teeth only the teeth on my left side touch bc my jaw is like physically crooked
√¢≈ì¬®just broken jaw things üéä
Sometimes when I'm half asleep I'm conscious but only have limited control over my jaw, so I can't close my mouth all the way. it's really awkward but that's also what paralyzed people feel like so it's always quite an experience
i want my jaw to be normal it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really debilitating sometimes
sometimes when im chewing it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll come@out of its place and then i chew when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s out of the socket and then it hurts so awful and bad and it crunches and i think i die
Does it hurt
Oh
I need cawfee
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m already gone lol
I gonna fail math test then
rip
Never drinking coffee on an empty stomach again
When my father was young he used to drink black coffee on an empty stomach he got a pretty bad ulcer
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
Id be able to see basically behind me
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put anything in my tea
I don't put leaves or water in my tea
wouldnt that just be air
Zach sucks the life force out of little children that he kidnaps off the streets and says it's "tea"
what the fuck
goat eyeballs without goat eye sockets are not effective for what you want/need
Fuck yeah
hell no I be rowing later I ain't doing no shoulders
I hate the rowing machine so much @.littlejimmy üò¢
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll work your pyloric sphincter üòâ
Go outside
Apparently
Oh fuck
My engr class has several covid cases pog
Without using precise mathematical definitions, the reason why Big-O is important is because it provides an upper bound on a function so we know it can never take longer than that. Avoiding the worst case is considered to be one of the key parts in algorithms but there are some algorithms with bad worst cases like quick sort that work well on average
Altough n^500 is technically an upper bound for n^2, we typically tend to use the supremum from the set of O(n^2) since saying that n^500 is O(n^2) doesn't help. So the supremum from that set would be n^2
Oh
So we usually use different runtimes to describe worst case and average
For quick sort, worst case is O(n^2) and average is O(nlogn), so we cannot say that the runtime for the algorithm will always be between bounds of the same complexity
It's never better than O(n) since it still has to check everything even if it's already sorted so quick sort is Omega(n)
I took this same class at NU and they didnt go over omega, just o
I cant find anything on stack overflow about Theta or Omega
I'm learning a new one in Algorithms that I didn't learn in Data Structures: Little omega
I can do this one my phone now: √è∆í√è‚Ç¨√é¬µ√è∆í√é¬µ√è∆í√é¬†√é¬£√é‚Ä∫√é≈ì√é≈ì√é‚Äòn√¢ÀÜ≈æ√¢ÀÜÀÜ√Ç¬±√¢ÀÜÀÜ√¢‚Ä∞ÀÜ√¢‚Ä∞ÀÜ√¢ÀÜ≈ì√¢ÀÜ≈ì√Ç¬æ√¢‚Ä∞‚Ä∞>>**
what the fuck is going on here
Without using the mathematical definition, f(n) = Theta(g(n)) means that the runtime complexity of the two functions grows at a similar rate
Oh
Oh
The linear algebra class I took tried to connect everything together so you had to explain how eigenstuff connected to the fundamental subspaces and determinants and everything else
Oh
Arent most of the ML classes grad students courses?
A lot of CS courses here are 400-level but it's complicated. Some of them are easy and others will be among the hardest classes ever. This is all based on what many other people have told me, I haven't taken a 400-level yet
I don't think our current sages advisors would know
Don't you get a dept advisor after you declare?
Omfg I missed my lecture
Bruh rip
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just 1 lecture it can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be that bad
If they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take attendance why not
apparently the AI minor requires it
it doesn't list CSDS 132 as an either or
im just gonna drop it if he says i can

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little √¢‚Ç¨≈ìclever√¢‚Ç¨ comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, and now you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re fucking dead, kiddo.
Dude reason I didn't do the dance with no pants with my ex was bc she was waiting for marriage
My fellow Americans, due to the overwhelming amount of Black squares teenage girls are posting on Instagram, the supreme court has decided end racism completely. We did not think you would go to such extreme measures but you have very much proved your point. The Military will be told to stand down just please stop. Thank you
Just to feel like this it took a long time üòî
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.

yost is a good place to cry
fuck theres this one masterlist of places to cry at cwru that was circulated freshman year
i can't find it
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in Chris Butler√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s office I know
yo my friend is also a geo major. she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go here though
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 100 places to cry at CWRU
how convenient as yost is a good place to cry. i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care what anyone says.
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s small and dark and houses the financial offices. obvious place to cry
the individual study pods at ksl seem like a nice place to cry
I don't even know how to feel anymore, I can't even cry when I wanted to during my mental breakdowns last week
I have yet to breakdown
Nothing hits me hard enough for me to break down anymore
As long as u don't form attachments u r fine
And get too tired to be angry
Transfer ur mental problems to your enemy #sigmagrindset

Playing Madden in 2021 is worse than ISIS

Don't test me in the middle
My friend was like that and I would literslly shit on him so bad up the middle that he started usering the mlb üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Only reason murray was dropped was cuz of cap space
Murray doesn't
Only reason bell was still there is cuz hes fucking garbage
Ravens threw to runningbacks the second least last year. They threw the last amount of passes to the flats of all NFL teams. Lamar just does not like them
So they need that option out of the backfield
I don't understand why they didn't go with Gurley
He's still available
It's a shame because he was an incredible back
I know. He wass fucking disgusting.
I was legit sad about dobbins
Dawg ravens have too many injuries to be a coincidence. Someone on that staff isn't doing their job
And I hate the Ravens
That's gonna HURT

i just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember the charges
do u think if i brute force chemistry it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter that i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know the charges of half of the polyatomic ions
i have four pages left in my rocketbook damn i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to go back and clean it
i have this really greatly organized polyatomic ion sheet from my AP chem class
if you guys want to use it
Imagine tryharding in school
dude i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to fail this exam
Neither do I but doesn't A3 also have stuff we haven't gone over yet

The one thing I forgot was the easy way to do distance from point to plane
i forgot that too
thats what i ended up with :cursed_flushed:
OH
i get so scared but like the exam is over so like.... we can talk about it right
were u supposed to use the distance formula for ur bounds??
i think i did it wrong
tbh im just hoping for partial credit on that
Well the speed I originally didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t simplify enough and I tried to do an integral with it and it did NOT work
i think i had my bounds wrong
I set the x y and z equal to the points it wanted and t was 3 for all of them
i did distance formula cuz i didnt know what to do LOL
Is there a curve on exams
I got the chemical naming stuff down but alek is literally shaming me for being not able to spell
fuck you too alekx

why are people always leaving shit in the washer/dryer
I hate the washers here
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even washing my clothes but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m angry too
i've found it to be wrong at times.
Thats mine sorry @jellieellie
are u serious
the timing is wrong on the washers
only cuz she left it there for like 20 mins
OH
yep. also, smith shows the first washer as always available even when its not. its like broke its connection or something
lol i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wake up early enough for that üò≠
I don't mean really early morning at like 6 or 7 AM. On Mondays and Fridays, all my classes are Zoom classes in the morning and afternoon, so I can do my laundry in between classes
i have like early classes so. i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have time in the morning to do mine is what i meant lol
how are all 3 dryers at 40 mins
if i run my laundry again with just water will that do anything bad
cuz no dryers are available and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want someone to move my@stuff
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just gonna leave it there
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want it like sitting there
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s another washer available
Why would someone move your stuff? Some people in my building have left clothes in the washer overnight and nothing happened
i left my stuff in the washer for 5 mins waiting for a dryer and someone moved it
like it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spin cycle
oh, didn't you drop a weight on your finger?

Dawg he told us he was like yea i dont believe in the concept of curving or some shit üò≠üò≠
But then against thats for math121

Curves can really save a GPA tho
Idk. Thats wat he told us but its diff for each class u know
Some professors don't give af
Connamacher was like one time my students all didnt do a hw thinking I wouldn't count it but I failed them all üò≠üò≠

i cant make you one OUT OF bones, but i can make one with bones on it
guys help me, specif cs majors or computer geeks, should I get dell xps, a macbook pro, or a gaming laptop :njnjkj:
gaming laptop @denzel.salas
i wanna be able to do like school work and stuff but also do gaming
Gaming laptops don't hold charges for shit
You take like 3 hours to charge that shit only for it to last like 2 hours without a powersource
Oh√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù
dont get a thinkpad
So like it wont be ideal to like do work at a coffee shop without bringing the charger or smth
you dont have to
My laptop lasts the entire day
then gaming laptop
but gaming laptop doesnt last the whole day
Idk cs like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so picky with brands, I only trust Apple, Dell, or Ryzen, is Lenovo, HP, or Asus any good/better??
if you aren't playing video games, just turn all the gaming shit off
you just kinda have to find the stuff you want in a laptop
then find a brand that has that laptop
mhm, kinda curious tho is it bad for the battery to like use the gaming laptop while it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s charging just so u can maximize the usage time
depending onwhat i need
Honestly just get a macbook air
someone from saipan lmfao u wont know who SKDKFKGKD
i currently have it set to 60% just bc its plugged in almost all the time (except for mornings and afternoons on tuesdays/thursdays) and that helps with battery lifespan
anywaysssss yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking of a gaming laptop so far
Cs then it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be able to handle apps like CAD or whatsoever engineering apps I need right? Well idt bme rlly needs those but yall get me
kinda. It wont charge past 60%, so it'll extend the battery life over a long period of tiem. If you always have something plugged in at max charge, then the amount of energy the battery can store over time actually decreases
8gb isnt enough for most games these days (and running os in background)
my computer doesnt have a setting to do that @100kstarsun üíÄ
They're getting harder and harder to fix
Okay so gaming laptop it is, so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alright in terms or productivity and other stuff right? So the downside is just what√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù portability? Cs aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they heavy? And you guys said short usage time?
@denzel.salas no problems so far
Alsooo is 1.2k for a laptop too much or
Total setup w monitor, chromebook, and computer is under 2k
Omg yess
I hate macbooks so much
Ik, I seriously was thinking of getting the Macbook Pro 13 but I could literally buy a different laptop with an overall better specs
can't hdmi
can't you use a wireless mouse @toomanyzs
They last a LONG ass time
don't get alienware you will regret it
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve a friend that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s had his since 8th grade and can still run shit like overwatch at at least 60 fps no problem
Damn
He left his laptop open when he went to the bathroom in class and we found bondage porn on jt :aPES_LulLaugh: :aPES_LulLaugh:
cant even use while charging
Mans really downloading porn in 2017 :aPES_LulLaugh: :aPES_LulLaugh: :aPES_LulLaugh:
I got it in my sophomore year of highschool and I'm senior in college
@denzel.salas literally all the gaming laptop companies are good except for razer
Amd can suck my ballz
RYZEN CAN SUCK MY FUCKING DICK
FUCK YOU
FUCK INTEL, AMD FOREVER
do u wanna die
Okay so you're not that far gone
Okay which one tho, left or right
Don't buy alienware
BRUH WHY IS INTEL AN OPTION DONT GET INTEL IM GONNA KISS YOU IF U GET INTEL
I have an alienware laptop with i-7 10870H, 16 Gigs of ram, 1 TB SSD, and an NVIDIA 3060 6GB DDR6
unrelated @toomanyzs will u tech fix my mac for me :cursed_flushed:
No, nobody can fix macs because they seal them with special screws that you can't get undone\
ok so you payed an extra grand over what i did for worse storage, a 3060, and a one gen improvement over my cpu
i think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a software issue it keeps crashing
No freaking wya
Imagine paying more than 1600 for a college laptop
Yall are so good at this wtf I feel so blessed
I would build my own PC but travelling with it is too much a pain in the azz
that laptop is worth its price but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probs more than what you need
pls fix my mac i have a big exam on wednesday
I don't have time to fix it, I'd take it to the service desk in the bottom of KSL
isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that a windows 11 feature tho
ugh idk how to say
hp, asus, idk the other
I kinda dont like HP for some reason
Still has the 30 series
he wanted a day-to-day laptop
I had an Acer Predator Helios 300 (the lowest end one) that I paid 1050 for and that lasted until Spring of Junior year
It didn't die on me
Not really
last I saw amd was more efficient and very similar performance
don't buy MSI
don't buy msi
don't get razer
Shit started freezing up n shit after 2 years of use
don't get alienware
Those Dells have poor physical build quality
bad screws
dont get dell
Bro I fix Dell computers just hold your tongue for once
LMFAO Zach is sick of our shit
Maybe I'm just unlucky but I and my family have had several ASUS laptops and they died quickly or had some terrible issues
I had to send mine back for repairs several times and it died after two years

And then he ran around campus for an hour
He keeps saying that we think he's gay
He also kept trying to run away
And now his phone is dead
Oof. U think he needs to puke or something?
No, not yet at least
I'm coming down in 5 mins @Deleted User
Yeah, he kept saying he was tired and bored so he got up and I followed him there
Fuck you >:|
I dont think its out yet
@Deleted User dont miss the cemetery thing
Do I have to reach out to my match tho
I bet you order food and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick it up either
@Deleted User you awake???
Im doing dead cat one
I've always wanted to try pumpkin spice cawfee

i hate eating breakfast at 9:30
now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m eating lunch because fuck the rules
pain
currently playing don't starve irl rn
Nvm we left
I would rather have it with a tortilla than rice though
Me and @alexthedawg saw @jellieellie outside norton about 20 minutes ago
i saw @jellieellie with my telescope from the roof of tink while doing english homework and cocaine off of the secret statue of babs up there
i feel like that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fake
yeah u kept saying "I'm hannah" idk
And then u starting comparing heights
jen why u so damn tall
hannah is just short
have you already ate there twice this week
i have never ate here
i ordered and they never brought me my food it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been an hour
oh so maybe they just don't allow bme students inside
they usually forgot it is all
annie and i got our food and jen is still waiting for theirs
who ate the other half
but they told you where the other half is
wow that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s crazy that that was a meme already that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wild I was just saying words I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know someone else had made the same joke before wow
my phone thought I was gonna sat burn my teeth
I dont have a sister
its probably someone spilled their den drink
how long until jolly decides jen can eat? almost an hour, apparently
they probably just forgot :/
they probably didn't know it was jen. otherwise they would have made sure to remember it
could never be me
the real question is what happened to my milkshake
@Deleted User why the hell are y'all so bad with customers????
is it not enough that y'all give us tummy ache after tempting us with the taste
@jellieellie u have to ask they prolly forgot or lost ur ticket so u need to ask or else u won't get anything
I got left on read for the n th time where n= I lost count üòÇ
@Deleted User bitch I've been waiting for my milkshake for 2 hrs where is it
Are the lines at Jolly really that bad today
I try to avoid peak hours to avoid waiting. I went to Leutner at 5:30 today and there was nobody there
and by top i mean the level of pain
Never knew it was a chair
im a fucking degenerate
Fuck doodle jump üñïü•±üñï
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry I need to stop playing doodle jump
@alexthedawg shut the fuck up
ayyy I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fail math
can someone send me today's notes for math 125? feeling sick :(
@wolfeee2156 student employment still hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t processed my papers
I was supposed to be working at utech weeks ago
when you say processed your papers do you mean you have already turned in like the passport and id or not yet?
I turned in the papers last Monday
has this been filled out yet?
Yea, turned it in monday
They just said theyll email me when i can work
okay well either way, let stan know you have brought the forms in and now its up to him. he decides when you work, not student employment
I emailed him that i turned in the forms to student employment
Im not in the clock in program yet though
have you checked your sign in yet?
has stan taught you the stuff yet
this is the last thing he said to me
let him know you are in hcm and have turned in your forms.

oh
oh you dont like me getting coffee???? you work in my basement, pissboy
DONT CALL ME PISSBOY
@_s.k I have a fever and my face is dying, could you possibly call me and show the movie
@wolfeee2156 how does the promotion to technician work?
uh you work as receptionist for a while and learn the ropes, then if you know enough you get taken to the back and can learn repairs and whatnot
taken to the back is so threatening
don't drop the motherboard
but that thing on the name means nothing. whenever there's like a good presence of other techs in front I will just head to the back and do repairs. however, if im the only one there I man the front in case somebody walks in
we had much more control over the machines since they were all under our image for the most part at my school
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in crawford! though i am not bang energy
Haven't had this yet
cough syrup that hurts you
what the FUCK
I want to become the *MASTER BLASTER*

Dude that doesn't mean we're dating 
People at this school aren't that shtoopid

This is potentially the worst "how I met your mother" story possible
idk I just
Wtf
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it but cc
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like the idea of being forced into a relationship by an algorithm
What could go wrong with handing all your opinions, ideas, and other data over to someone you don't know? I'm sure nothing called Cambridge Analytica ever happened
oh that too
Every college is doing this rn, so I think it's some company behind this
Since daddy zucc already knows everything abt me
I didn't mind
Tldr, they dont make any money

Wade is not closed
Fin is fucking lurking on my doc and doesn't even say thank you

Yeah but what's the chance that the printers work?
they work
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be asleep sorry
omg
They always work for me because if they're not working I fix them
Um I don't but someone was asking about printers?
fix them for us as well pls :wearycritty:
I GOT MY SHIT PRINTED
they are always broke
either the card reader broke or the usb port broke
or the card reader isn't broke it just says
*type in your ID and very long password that u prolly don't remember*
i tried to print in agnar pytte earlier and it literally did not work
I will die before I download the wepa app
Maybe if 100000000 people a day didn't try to slam their card in and rip it out like a pull start lawnmower
*welp we don't have any paper left*
first they want me to use their broke printers, and force me to download their app just to print something
I WANT
By being stupid
dont log in. use the wepa code.
more like weep my tears i cant frikin print anything
cuz why not
the one in front of schmitt never reads ur card
Because I've been complained at by people all weekend "case doesn't *insert complaint*" which is actually the fault of students being lazy/destructive/slobs
Because we hate you idk
oh i was actually gonna apply to be a wepa tech but im not available til 5 on fridays and they need u to be available 3-6 :(
The real answer I can't say
ok fair enough :LAUGHING:
I can't apply to be a wepa tech because I have no driver's license
Anyone who doesn't have a driver's license is in my based kids club
i have gotten packages so many times and they have not been lost
I don't like this
even though I am an American citizen
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a drivers license
Oh gosh
By being ran over by a Ford F150 then shot with an ar15
didnt get who u were hoping for :(
I didn't get any of my crushes as a match
Good cuz my actual crush goes to another school
I'm so irritated with the helplessness of some of the students "Oh the bathrooms have toilet paper everywhere, why don't they clean them, tell them to clean them" damn why don't you and your floor mates not throw toilet paper everywhere????
"the common room is messy" then tell the people who make it messy to clean it up
Oh
Rip
It is not hard to be an adult
u sure tho
You have to solve problems in life
me when i think it's the weekend but it's still monday
Why is geology hard
geology sucks ass
Fucking liars
I have a class with a prof with a 1.9 difficulty rating but I'm dying in the class
Was anyone else pretty peeved about the den being closed yesterday night
bruh i believed this class would be easy, cause we have a chance to drop the  exam
Not really
They already are pushing it to 12 by maxing hours on a couple of people.
i feel so bad for the den workers :( they are all so sweet and ik they are so stressed
What class is this
Have you seen what it's like out there, Isaac? Do you ever actually leave the dorm room? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like James Van Orman, men at ease, ever think what it's like to be a guy like me? To be anybody but themselves. They don't. They think we'll all just sit there and take it like good little boys. That we won't werewolf and go wild.
And there are literally signs that say "staffing issues are forcing us to close early" and I still hear people going fisushentlgieie wHy Is ThE dEN closed/taking so long
Some leutner people are a little mean tho. Just a whittle.
The next person who asks me why the lines are so long I'm going to print them an application so they can go help fix that issue
as a fast food worker i understand their stress so hard and i hope it gets better soon üò≠
One of them snapped at my roommate for filling her water bottle cuz the water thingy was spurting everywhere but she couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t helped thatüò©
He don't understand us
i think they are also just stressed and probably in a bad mood cuz of it
cus ik im mean at work sometimes lol
yeah i mean its not really fair to call it invalid if they just dont have workers
you cant expect the same 5 people to work 12 hours every day of the week
Paying thousands of dollars for food and expecting to actually get food without shortages every day and long lines does not make someone ungrateful
Bro I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how supply lines work
That money is budgeted to pay for certain meals, certain supplies
You can't just
Summon more materials if the supplier doesn't have them
I think you all should just man up and kiss one another already
I understand that a lot of supply chains are disrupted right now, but if they can't provide the service, maybe they shouldn't force people to buy it
It wasn't interrupted when you bought it
Take a step back and imagine you're a cook in the back there and some 19 year old sophomore comes up and asks you why you don't have certain items that are on back order from a supplier somewhere in like fucking colorado or china and stomp their foot and tell them that they paid for xyz and they're gonna get it
Service
To work for CWRU
who wants to work for cwru tho
I dont even know what perpendicular is
Everything hurts
Isnt that what you do when you cut the ball tubes
Anyways, yeah the professor is probably in his last year before retirement and he saw how good he was and was like sike bitch u thought
he like specifically said at the beginning that people dont do badly in this class
he basically said its an easy A class without saying it
@_s.k r u still at tyler lounge

Adore or despise them, GIFs are integral to the social experience of the Internet. Thanks to a range of buttons, apps, and keyboards, saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìit me√¢‚Ç¨ without words is easier than ever. But even a casual observer of GIFing would notice that, as with much of online culture, black people appear at the center of it all. Or images of black people, at least. The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Oprah, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, NBA players, Tiffany Pollard, Kid Fury, and many, many other known and anonymous black likenesses dominate day-to-day feeds, even outside online black communities. Similar to the idea that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBlack Vine is simply Vine,√¢‚Ç¨ as Jeff Ihaza determined in The Awl, black reaction GIFs have become so widespread that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve practically become synonymous with just reaction GIFs.

If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never heard of the term before, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdigital blackface√¢‚Ç¨ is used to describe various types of minstrel performance that become available in cyberspace. Blackface minstrelsy is a theatrical tradition dating back to the early 19th century, in which performers √¢‚Ç¨≈ìblacken√¢‚Ç¨ themselves up with costume and behaviors to act as black caricatures. The performances put society√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s most racist sensibilities on display and in turn fed them back to audiences to intensify these feelings and disperse them across culture. Many of our most beloved entertainment genres owe at least part of themselves to the minstrel stage, including vaudeville, film, and cartoons. While often associated with Jim Crow√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúera racism, the tenets of minstrel performance remain alive today in television, movies, music and, in its most advanced iteration, on the Internet.
also why the moo do dorms smell so shity i can't take a normal breath
Like, seriously. Google it. Google Nicocado Avocado's asshole right now and tell me it isn't the most unappetising asshole you've ever witnessed. Like, what is wrong with that man's asshole? It looks like it's either melting or collapsing in on itself. It has to be the single most unappealing, disgusting asshole I've ever had the displeasure of googling. I would rather shove my head up the goatse dude's distended, Stretch Armstrong shit chute than look at Nicocado Avocado's collapsing asshole one more time.

What is wrong with Nicocado Avocado's asshole?
Worst mistake of my life
oh :Eyes: 
what happens if someone calls
depends if i feel like picking up
people dont rly call anymore tho
just get a 11:30am class, its great being able to wake up and not think about class first thing
(this has the unfortunate side effect of classes till like 6 tho
i have 1130 class but still in that situation
and dont do the big brain classes
i take these classes cuz i'm no brain
this class destroyed my confidence, my self-esteem, my mental health, and my gpa

Imagine after you die like your soul just gets trapped in the body like there's no heaven or hell or reincarnation, like
you're just stuck in your coffin forever
Everything hurts
Guts is never sad, only angry
Mans reminds me to struggle, fail, and keep on struggling
Andre is laughing at my pain
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never laugh at your pain
I will now commit seppuku for I can no longer live with the shame
Damn that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tuff

Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all bullied Finn into leaving smfh

Ik fo sure I got at least a handful wrong
Making an 8 page study guide helped I guess
73% class average on the exam 1 of chem
gah damn
I failed that shit literally.
Thank god he drops worst 2
Wtf r u in Thwing rn too
Damn
That's basically what it was last year
@.littlejimmy feeling some Chic Fil A 4 today
holy shit norton spelled backwards is norton
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be deadass
no thats wrong
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you literally do chest yesterday
How√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d you find that out ?
He showed class results / distribution
Oh okay well doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to me then haha
I took CHEM 111 last fall and he curved it but just because the average grade was a lot lower than previous years
3 percent ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gon do nothing üíÄ
what if you have an 87 tho @.littlejimmy
Damn
Finna hop on SARMS fr this time I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t with this üò≠üò≠üò≠
I had one professor who made really difficult exams but curved them so almost everyone got an A or B, econ professor named Daniel Shoag so you might take classes with him since you're a business major.  Other than that, I haven't had any professors that provided a significant curve at the end, Meyer was definitely the most generous among all my STEM professors
In that econ class I literally got a 125% on one exam
My SAGES professor was also really generous with grading at the end
But he also teaches a bunch of other classes. He told me he has like 5 or 6 kids and taught 4 classes last semester so he was really busy
I want to take Econometrics which he teaches but there are too many classes I want to take so I probably can't fit it into my schedule
Mans really turned rabbit mode huh üíÄ
Micro/macro shouldn't be too hard, not sure about accounting, Java will take tons of time
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s intro I so I reckon not too bad
Anything that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t involve science I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve always done well in school
Only science I did well in was bio, not chem tho, fuck chem
Don't be deceived by the name lol, it's a time-consuming class and it's especially difficult if you don't already have experience in Java or another object-oriented language

@zackt7718 I just realized in order to cut more effectively I have to do cardio after weights :copege:
Ew moving
Fuck no Imma die
Cardio doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really burn fat
And there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only so much I can lift
Dude my cut is going to be about 2300 calories man
My cut is like
How much are you trying to lose a week ???????
idk like 5 lbs
Omg

This never was about health yk
Okay when your kidneys stop working by the age of 30

5 pounds a month is already a lot, and this dude wants 5 a DAY
My body adapted to it and stopped cutting
What the fuck dude
Body was probably breaking gown his lean muscle mass lmfao
according to the wonders of the apple health app apparantly i burn like 2k/day doing NOTHING, and im not even really in shape. how the actual FUCK did you live on 1500 LIFTING
Yes and then because of the lack of other macros your body breaks down your lean muscle mass for energy please study a little about nutrition before changing your diet man PLEASE
She also said a lot of other weird shit so
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve prolly lost equal amounts muscle and fat cutting like that ngl

Every MWF I go to ksl for my fix
until the vending machine at tink starts working again

Just checking if I'm the only one feeling that way
I want to do those too
If I want to show my ass, I need ASS

Physics labs will be the death of me

The tuning fork going off every 5 seconds made me want to cap myself with .50 AE
i considered intentionally fainting so that i won't hear them anymore

Fuck, we have to fix MacBooks?

I'm not going to med school south of the mason Dixon line
Fall SZN is back like it never left
what gave it away

hurts your ears
oh my god my nose is running
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not fast enough it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s getting away
They have heating inside
Having heating inside sucks fucking ass
Cold surroundings + warm blanky is the only proper way to spend winter
i wish
a lab manual to read and an essay to write and a bunch of forms to fill out yet
Bruh when I was doing my math quiz theres these 2 Vietnamese kids behind me talking through the whole thing and when I got up to turn in my paper I saw them scrolling through notes:cursed_flushed:
Don't be a snitch @.littlejimmy
I'd never want you as my doctor
No, let them do what they need to do. They will face consequences in the future... you don't need to snitch right now in the short term because it will catch up to them in the future
arent you supposed to report anything you see tho
yeah and I don't want the curve messed up because of cheaters
Will it though? People who copied off me in high school are now in pretty high places because they copied off someone else after me, and someone else before me.
People in my high school in Macedonia might have known me as a "shitty person" who's "unwilling to help", but I know full well that I offered them help that wasn't letting them copy off me, so no weight on my conscience. Point is, sometimes they get away with it for way too fucking long
Not necessarily college, college is a huge problem for cheating @tsunderratedd
Depending on their profession, they'll realize that Google and copying off others won't get them anywhere, and they'll get fucked
i dont understand what stack exchange and github say half the time üò≠
u dont need to understand anything besides  ctrl c and ctrl v
A prof is not curving a quiz tho üíÄ
that class is not hard enough to justify cheating
Son we had a 90! Minutes exam with 10! Multiple choice questions
@.littlejimmy geo exam grades are out
Oh shit
How long did it take meyer to grade 105s exams
And it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a huge class
Idk
i wish SI sessions were over zoom
like sorry i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t walk all the way back to my dorm from bingham at 10pm?

i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared and the fear is emphasized by him not having the s last names ready
s last name supremacy though
Me staying in that class or not kinda depends on how I did on that test and he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have them graded :aPES_LulLaugh:

Been waiting since 2 trying to do laundry
But if someone else is complaining, it falls on deaf ears
And I'm not just going to leave my stuff in the dryer like them and go out with my friends
There needs to be some sort of system for this shit... it's actually getting on my nerves
But otherwise, what you do is you leave your laundry bag in front of the machine so someone can at least put your clothes into it when they're done
smart
but isn't the basilic a snake
If you leave your clothes in the machine
They smell of wet dog
Though you do deserve to smell like wet dog if you do that shit üò§
Ok fuck it I'm putting this girls laundry on top of the dryer I ain't dealing w this shit any more
Aaand someone put in another fucking load
Because all my clothes ran out
I do laundry whenever my last piece of clothing runs out
As a medical expert I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recommend killing yourself

I've just received horrible news - the choices fair this year will now be ONLINE due to administration deciding to not bother with an in-person fair
however, anthro, health comms, comms, psychology and sociology has decided to still host their own little choices fair on the Mather memorial lawn Octtober 8th at 12:45-2:00
Our department is rebels apparently
*dead*
The joke is I don't think u can do bench press to failure unless u have a spotter
I've seen a guy almost got crushed by the bar to death
i am studying directly adjacent to that is that ok
Why do they not want an in-person fair?
not sure. maybe administration was satisfied with how online went last year

But no doesn't sound like you'll get charged with anything, as long as his mom consents
he did get a scratch tho
time to get a break from this question ugh
Get a break? The lack of context is killing me, I want answers

Drew Myer walked into Thwing asking where the flu shots r
Drew Myer doesn't know where Tink is
why would he know though
He's been in this school for longer than I could speak English
Shit hits hard
A lot of faculty probably don't know where it is since they wouldn't need to go there often
Yeah I guess it is since it's the most iconic/important building on campus
@kaori_flute u forgot to include location information for TVUC
People won't be able to find where TVUC is
@eekhannah do you want anything for your BARFü§¢day?

I want to make a joke
Last time I got stabbed by an ink pen the mark is still there
Oh that happened to me in 4th grade and I think the mark is still there

Down bad
One u have to order alone
I think I'm sick
Oh shit
If I ever instigated I'm sorry
No cap n gown i aint go to class
Am I missing some context? Why do you have to summarize his life story?
It's how the path to become a neuroscientist isn't a straight path
Also he apparently worked with Jane Goodall, :cursed_flushed:
Ur prof needs therapy
ksl shift coverage again from 8-11pm drop by and visit because i will be very sad and lonely otherwise :nkoded:

@nobelium19 @_the_intern_ Where do you guys go now that the study lounge is locked
I have since relocated to Olin's computer lab
Why is the study lounge locked?
There's supposed to be quiet time? Whenever I go in there the materials science students are talking
yeah, so it sucks
How does the card reading system know your major though?
Oh damn
I have two classes in the White Building so it's kinda ridiculous that I don't have access to the lounge
I think there's a lounge in Glennan too but I haven't been there yet
And Glennan is the EECS building so they won't kick CS students out
probably? most buildings should have common spaces inside
he left the building as i entered :NkoSad:
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t Olin the building that looks most like a prison building?
it's as bad as it is
Just realized how insanely extra my winter outfit is
Good thing it's not cold enough for me to dress up like a clown yet
@kaori_flute imma study in tink
about to go to class :wobble:
serious
i have it from my eye doctor at home
but im scared it will look bad
I feel like
This one tho
I feel like it won't look as obvious irl
Could work
If u want
not everyone has the privilege of being able to buy glasses at an office especially with how expensive they are
yeah i didn't wanna say anything
So disappointed
i don't like ppl taller than me it implies that im not the alpha
I want a man to dunk on me with his steak knife @alexthedawg
WTF
Most of it isn't too bad but I need to keep studying randomized algorithms since I was distracted during the lectures for those
HOLY SHIT :NM_peepoStarWars:
damn
haven't eaten since this morning and the den is the only place to eat that's open right now with 87 in line
Why haven't u eaten since morning
because I came from class and I had a lot of shit to do @speedbirdconcorde2
euclid ave is on some whack shit at night
you need to be institutionalized
How did it make you feel
i have a hard time trusting that oscar
oh
Oh
Nothing beats granola
we want our excessive sugar
That's an abomination I haven't yet attempted
Oh
I miss leutner breakfast
I don't think u can eat the leutner sausage tho
they'd have turkey sausage tho
it was still bad
Aren't fribley eggs the same thing
and i hate them
I've legit never cooked breakfast for anyone
what eggs though
I don't think my scrambled r that much better than leutners
But they just don't taste that different
scrambled = bad
That's practically a bad omelet
I don't have a non-stick so I can't cook omelet
I leave them not as fully cooked as leutner ones
i want a sleeping day
Sorry for keep asking but r u gonna work in tink/ksl
tomorrow is going to be a lot of improv and last minute chaos
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s late though
Who was out lateüò∂
I was watching a video about how dinosaurs might have sounded so I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hear anything
Jk I have nothing to throw
I wish Leutner had chroizo eggs every day :PES_Cry:
It's October and the weather is so comf
Babs did not leave with the weather machine
why tf would they do the lawn mowing and stuff so early in the morning when people are trying to sleep
React with hug emoji
Last time I hugged someone was in August:crii:
Someone match with me plsü•∫
so that people like @eekhannah think lawnmowers don't exist
Why am I laughing so hard at this üò≠üò≠üò≠
Fuck lawns
Don't water that shit
I mean, you're not wrong
I'm never wrong
grubhub is broken
I just want to get my back checked out before I end up in a wheelchair
Ik u r really looking for a girl but sorry to disappoint, only got bros here
Aren't check ups with health service all online now
U need a referral from them to go to UH
No, I had an in-person appointment last week
If it's just health service u don't need anyone to go with u, unless you'll actually be on a wheelchair
Ik someone who also had back problems, he does some sort of exercise training with a provider near by, I can ask him if u need
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna go to the doctor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s office by myself :PU_MonkaMegaCry:
Cuz that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just sad
Wtf
Is that where health service moved to now?
I guess
i went by myself
Do I need me wallet
Oh
The appointment is at 1:20 should I head out at 12:50 or is that too early
It used to be that but they changed it
They still call it dental building tho
It seems
Well actually idk if atm is appropriate since Idek what it was like before :aPES_LulLaugh:
haven't planned that far ahead :xCrittyx:
Dawg it is raining so fucking hard
Must be nice being able to go home for fall break

Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all bathrooms don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be clean?

Fuck them veggies
Sad
how many hours did you sleep
why didn't u just

U don't
rise and grind isn't part of the system today
Haven't u been up till 4am lately anyway

Actually I just calculated based on how much those canvas alone would cost, this is not too bad
But guess I won't be using this sort of premium shit
Still waiting as anxiously as u r
The PhD students were complaining about Patel so I assumed he wasn't that good üòÇ
hes nice, not teaching conceptually tho, he just does practice problems
I mean most of physics is doing problems so I guess that's acceptable
Seems like not the worst professor in the world but definitely worse than Covault
and by doing practice problems i mean he takes 2 classes to do 1 problem
So far I don't understand a thing from all the classes this sem
driscoll is evil. fuck lab.
i will never forgive her for this
currently wanting nothing but death
you didnt submit?

Winston just wasn't on shift
Doesn't KSL kick everyone out at 5 on Friday
@_the_intern_ does library hours mean just no more public access or does it mean students have to leave too

Why do my exams never happen on the same time as everyone else
so tempted to not do work today
I prefer to just cut manually @.littlejimmy
Wtf
the weather is calling out people to go outside
this is what I'm missing out on rn just being in the US
I can't tell if this is based or cringe, maybe I should expand my range of expressions
Wow plain forgot to eat dinner today üíÄ
How do you forget to eat dinner? Don't you feel very hungry?

i heard that people fuck in the common rooms of hitchcock iirc and get freaked out when people "walk in" on them
LOOL oh no
What the hell?
The only thing I've ever seen people do in study rooms is study
And we are going to fix this
It seems like midterms week got to stressful
students when they use the study room and sit on something wet: :nkoScream:
I didn't even think about that 
Good grief
Apparently it aint only the third floor btw
Damn y'all underage drinking now?
~~god I wish that was me~~
What class is this?
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually not TOO bad
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s honestly not as bad as it sounds

I might cook next year when I'm off the meal plan but right now I don't want to spend extra money
The refs fucking hate cleveland
Myles Garrett is getting held on every single play and they won't call it a single time
And they called that shitty play a DPI and it fucking wasnt+myles got injured as a result

yeah zach why do you hate tall children??
i've lost it
oh
if you dont like the way the server is managed you dont have to stay in it
@toomanyzs can I get an extension coord for the lobby? we kinda need it
AFAIK the rule only really applies to dorm rooms
U won't believe how many extension cords I had back in freshman yr
Well there's a difference between extension cords and power strips, right? Because I definitely had one of those, who doesn't
There's no way you can survive if you don't have a power strip
I'm surviving without one. I can plug in 8 things in my room (outlets that aren't blocked by things like the bed) and I usually only need 3
Phone, laptop, and lamp
I also don't need one atm but if you're in freshman dorms I believe I only had one outlet that wasn't blocked by anything
2.5hrs I did exactly 2.5 problems
A problem an hour, not bad üòÇ
This HW has 5 problems
my brain stopped working
I think juniper is just cringe and doesn't have as many outlets as Chad mistletoe
we got 3 hours 
could be a very productive session or vice versa
I forgot which I was in
8-9 but imma study u wanna have a study sesh or sumn
I'm prolly gonna study too
Did u have an exam today

Attention all CWRU Gamers, Eric Kaler is in great danger, and he needs YOUR help to wipe out all the thieves on 115th Street. To do this, he needs the campus emergency number (do not call 911!). To help him, all he needs is your CaseID, the 16 numbers on the front, and the six digits on the back. But you gotta be quick so that Eric can secure the campus trespassers, and achieve the epic victory R O Y A L.
I literally learned everything in this class from the textbook solutions manual
I was so confused in class
I want to have a java test manual
Math as well maybe
Someone must have been in the exact situation
Maf pain
Guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in hell

What if o don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to tell u
Or class notes
Tests aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t open book
8hrs
8 maf problems
Do 10hrs of sleep
Tbh I will feel absolutely awful if I sleep for more than 8
I actually never had continuous sleep
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m used to sleeping over 12 hours UwU
Holy shit
Now, unless you wake up too many times and for long
I never sleep cuz sleep is the cousin of death
I bet sleep is a lot closer to death in Alabama
Nah, they're still cousins
They r still cousins, just a lot closer than usual in Alabama
God I need sleep
@tsunderratedd how u doin math wise

Calc 3 midterm was fucking brutal
jesus fucking christ
how many people are in the class!?
RIP
why is windingpath so FUCKING complicated
Just starting
If it makes you feel any better I'm a TA and I haven't done it yet
dunno
See the problem is we aren't given keys so we have to make them up ourselves
But I can't think of a better one
Hwo do u do that without a bunch of if statements
It's just really complicated
doesn't really matter
but thats fancy shit
RIP :LAUGH:
nah ik how to find that
So the code would first:

Find the smallest point:
- Nested for loop, runs through row 1, then row 2, then row 3, until there aren't any more rows
-All while keeping track of the smallest value & its position
What class is this for?
Ah can't help then
You saw nothing.
Fake anime fan doesn't even recognize one of the most iconic and OG anime smh

@denoris i finished is winding path and it took longer than all the other methods combined
it worked tho?
the only thing that keeps me going is that adele is coming back on friday
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tested an empty array for isWindingPath and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m too scared to do it so I just put as a prereq that the array can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be empty üòÇ
i just need to actualylw rite the code
maybe it will work
Too late I already submitted it üòÇ
I do not need to take chem
so it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to you then

I'll probably take PHYS 122 next semester. I couldn't do it this one cause it filled up before registration started for me
omg wes is repping freud in his pfpüíØüíØüíØüòç
So today during my MATH 122 test my calculator ran out of battery about 20 minutes in. Panic. I plugged it into my laptop to charge but then my laptop died. Panic. So I plugged in my laptop to the wall and my calculator to the laptop. Charging only works for a minute or two then my calculator shuts off. Panic. I open my computer slightly to turn it on then charging works consistently. No panic. More than half the test time has passed and I haven't even done half the questions. Panic. I go big brain and skip the ones that get me stumped. I then return to them after all others are finished. Only 5 minutes left. Panic. I realize a simple mistake in my calculations. I fix it and check my answer. It is good and I finish the test on time with all questions answered with a reasonable degree of confidence. I need to take a piss real bad. Panic. I rush to give my test in and go to the bathroom. Relaxation at last.
oh
I would rather keep them locked away
Mom has just finished cooking on electric stove. She turns off the heat. I think "She has turned it off. It must be cool now". I spread my whole hand onto the stove. Pain.

6 lectures Is a lot to miss
I feel old
Nvm found it I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a fucking stooge

Well isn't windows 11 as a whole trash rn?
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tried it out
I've heard in games it's way worse. Yet I get windows 11 ads saying it's good for gaming
use internet explorer instead it's way faster
Pls dont install windows 11
Wasn't going to lol
Both new MacOs and Win11 are horrible
But idk I've only had shitbooks my entire life
The issue is, even if you have the recommended specs, it still can brick your laptot
What happened to "windows 10 will be the last windows"
no work done
The only Windowses I've ever ran on my last two laptops have all been Windows Server, because I don't need them for anything other than running apps and games that really won't run on Linux no matter what
dorm chair + hoodie + target throw + aleks = some work done for me
Imagine working in where u sleep

YOOO. Weatherheard finially got their shit on SIS
has anyone still never vsited a professor's office hours bc they have a pathological fear of them
Rats really be learning calc 2 at CWRU
I went in person to a professors office hours once last year and got exposed to covid so that kind of put a damper on it for me, but I do Normally think it's worth it
I go to Connamacher's office hours to play csgo
I might go to connomacher√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s office hrs even though im not in any of his classes
He said he just doesn't wanna feel lonely
Bro wtf :NM3_PepeCry:
He was like, come to office hours, we can talk about anything, I don't wanna go down a YouTube rabbithole alone in my office

It's things like this that makes me really miss Florida
shit
I wanted to stay in Florida
Yet u r currently in Oh*o
i did not want to be in ohio
i, too, wanted to stay in my state but my state did not want me to stay there
i can understand why you wanted to stay
i wanted to be in ohio
life's too short to live in ohio
cuz similar to ohio, case is where hope goes to die
mine isn't
except for some things üëÅ√Ø¬∏
i like it here i just don't particularly vibe with my current scenario
He needs to go down a how can I be a better professor rabbit hole
Ohio not that bad
It really shouldn't be
Did they complete their work eventually?
Dawg I am freezing to death
It's still nearly 20 above freezing

I'm at work atm
maybe later, still gotta review the CSDS 233 lectures that I don't attend, we can do it then
Yeah, and they're all really difficult classes. Some 400-level classes aren't too hard but those are
I'm planning to take CSDS 391, MATH 444, and a stats class next semester, should help a lot with AI
arduous, but the end result is dope af
Damn
Apparently that is just a general rule of thumb for most project based CS classes
My coworker is in a 400 level class, but has some guy in his team who doesn't understand object orientation
I have several friends taking 391 next semester but idk if we're going to be in the same group
You don't really need to know object-oriented programming that well to pass most CS classes other than Java and Data Structures so that's actually not that surprising
the guy also doesn't know what a class is either
Oh dang
That's bad
das not a cs breadth tho :0
I'm so stressed with choosing classes that over defaulted to the boring ones üòéüëâüëâ
i'm thinking about computer architecture, networks, AI or software engineering :nkoHmm:
Noice, idk what i want to do in engineering so MechE it is üëÅ√Ø¬∏üëÑüëÅ√Ø¬∏
Am I supposed to reverse calculate this shit or did she just make a mistake
Breadth electives tho
gotta do the requirements first tho
i don't like the look of that cs class
although i feel like i need to study more for it now :LAUGH:
and I can't take both
RIP
do you have
I want Earnest for macro
oh mmmmmmmmm
Idk why
i took 3 weeks with grible online 
he was ok
if you take notes while he talks, you won't fall asleep
i never tried them :LAUGH: i'm just telling you about grible in case you end up with him
he's not bad
as far as my 3-week experience sees
Are his quizzes/tests hard
i didn't take tests with him
i remember having weekly modules which ended with quizzes and it was pretty easy
idk if that changes in person
or did you just take 3 weeks and drop the class
Community college by my high school
I didn't think Khan academy would be that useful in college
apparently I'm wrong
cuz i hath 0 knowledge in econ
I still have 0 physics knowledge tbh

That's how it was last year
Related rates is one of the best quiz grade√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had in math
Wtf
it was literally my worst one
~~you get 5 projects, project assignment is always given the day the previous one is due under normal circumstances~~
Why r CS major getting so many projects
Dude I remember that shadow legends one I didnt know it was u

The AliExpress seller that sold me a thin nylon trenchcoat for nearly $40 when promising a nicer polyester one just replied to my request for a $20 refund with

Oh boi I'm so bad at recognizing people

I don't really see that sorta shit happening here
But nothing surprises me anymore
It really ain't :(
I'm hoping it's just a rumor
??? can you really not fucking infer what it previously said
I'm too innocent for this, I legit was like "what's wrong with 'hail butler'"
You won't get jail time for writing hail . .. on the windows just by itself
And I didn't wanna continue the stupid rumor if that was the case
i just don't know how to orgagnize this class hierarchy for the project
i have a structure but idk how good it is
*shit*
i feel like it's i++

Holy shit aleks A6 calculating partial pressure is so fucking stupid
Whoever thought up and wrote that shit, including the explanation part can actually fucking find another career

@wolfeee2156 didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wave at me
May i ask why? Idk what type of engineering i want to do
Wtf
I was here for just Aero but I soon realized I won't get employed that way
Didn't wave at me either
i was on a mission. i didn't even see you
i didn't see you either
i guess when im getting food in leutner i can't see anything else
If u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a good fit why would give me an acceptance letter back then
give me back my money
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not gonna learn anymore
why would you use things that I just can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learn to humiliate me
I can't wait to join the class of 26 discord and fuck with the freshmen
But I dont think its on the meal plan @.littlejimmy
Nope it's not
I am running on 2300 calories, starving, and Geology is making me its bitch rn I cannot describe how much I want to bang my head against my wall
Shit is like 500cal

I wish I was joking
I wish I had a fat fucking burger in front of me rn
why is KSL so dead
I feel so stupid
So fucking stupid rn
I did basic math wrong
I'm 3yrs in still can't do math
But the profs become more forgiving to bad mafs
Me when i breezed though the act math section and it ended up being my lowest scoring section üòé

I hope the person in the clarke ambulance didnt get the foid posioning from fribley
Bruh I just realized that MATH121 and MATH122 count towards the 13 CS course requirement
Meaning that I don't need to take 2 classes
I think they don't count
Who is someone that you hate
Because the bulletin doesn't seem to indicate htat
Yeah I'm quite certain it's just an SIS glitch because Calculus doesn't count as a CS class
There are some math classes that do but those are scientific computing, numerical analysis, etc. Calculus is not a computing class at all
Oh sorry
Racist fuck
I use my calculator, that is a computer
if in my sleep I roll over and put my hands over my gf's nose and mouth and she suffocates
There is no crime because you can't smother an invisible person
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a real high school
That school must be predominately arab cuz wtf
I worked in restaurants for a long time and I don't wanna do that shit anymore
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that next level modification
Sorry, we haven't done problems involving imaginary terms in calc II yet
Cuz my advisor gave us an electronic form
Dude I didnt make ur shake last time I was on the line

i told him that dad jokes prolly won't be a thing in the coming years

No fair you edited it
Don't give up
i need help myself
Never give up
If you change your perspective so that you're getting a college degree not just for yourself -- but for your parents, siblings, and their future financial stability -- the motivation comes far more easily
I didn't mean it like that üò≠ 
Some people use their parents' struggles as motivation, because you have moms and dads working job on job trying to support their kid in college while making ends meet at home for their other siblings
but i tried looking up peer tutors for my class and there aren't any
which class?
I also get the other point, where it's basically toxic to study for parents who have been pushing you around since childhood
bruh i just searched in tutor trac for peer tutors in that class and i got none
Litcherally yesterday I sat with someone in Java and they scheduled an appointment
Bless the peer tutors for physics 122 they are hard carrying me
Lots of work for the student and arguably more work for the TA
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m meeting a peer tutor for Java tomorrow though ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏
I didnt disagree with u alex
maybe you're searching the wrong section? because you have the recitation section
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so aggro against you that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m starting to see things that aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there üòî
I hate you
i've never seen an absolute value in the middle of there before üò¨
this prof really is assigning the wackest problems
bitch u don't think i tried?

Petition to make all crying emojis bannable offenses
nothing you would be able to help with
@toomanyzs gg Bengals fucking suck. We been knew yall were frauds #1 in the afc my ass
cuz it just isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
if it's a physics problem I can def help, if its "whens the next exam" then no idk
its literally not a physics problem thats why i said you wouldnt be able to help with it
I think if u said that in the beginning instead of "nothing u be able to help with" would be a bit nicer, imo
But np at all I hope u find an answer
yalla go study
Get used to it, it only creeps earlier each day

hospital visits are expensive
bruh, I was talking to someone else when you walked by the lounge, so I briefly turned around my chair and gave a slight wave
~~didn't know there was anything like that~~
OMG TAE-HEE
she was my OL last year
now i wish i came :")
or club work
No, I just turned around to look at you but it took me a while to realize that it was you and by the time you left I gave a small wave
was the sightreading too bad
not terrible except for one song I butchered
that describes so many people on campus though
oh yeah I think I forgot to ever change that
not really
Wtf
someone in my zoom meeting was talking to someone on their phone or sumn and forgot to mute themselves
Ofc he doesn't want Palestinians to succeed
he's jealous that palestinians are smarter than him

Unpopular opinion: Hummus tastes better without tahini @Deleted User
Should be able to doh
My head is pain rn and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to prep food but I think there are sides where you combine both and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s good
And it's gone
Jenin u litcherally can't make hummus without tahini
Whether its in smaller quantities or not u need the tahini for the texture
Otherwise it tastes like shit
u dont need tahini for texture @Deleted User
Wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t 100% sure so I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say
someone was probably on another kind of kusch in their room
The tasteful thickness of it, omg, it even has a watermark
I want to buy an NFT but mfs only use crypto
the closest gif i could find :ohgod:
realise you've made a terrible decision
cry
I just don't use any wallets that's accepted
Oh
crypto is so fucking stupid
and it will never progress to legitimate currency status
It *would,* if it didn't gain so many stupid use cases...
the only ~~legitimate~~  use case I can think of is buying drugs on the internet
Look, as soon as Bitcoin started to be traded by rich people as a pastime (much like the stock market has been traded for ages, but at least that's regulated so someone can't crash it overnight so easily), it lost its potential to be used as an actual currency
NFTs are fucking stupid
legitimate isn't the exact right word
Legitimate and legal ain't the same :)
but theres so many (probably millions) of people who think it's a huge deal, so it's probably gonna keep rising in price while not actually being used for much
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just a money laundering scheme
guys i thought i failed my math test but i did really well and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m happy :CB_wearyy:
ok this isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t about u
I once again reiterate that crying pepes should be punishable by time in federal prison
Because NFTs are non-fungible, a screenshot of it under a different Ethereum smart contract is yet another NFT
yet another reason NFTs are dumb
For much less, but still enough to cover the reproduction cost
Has anyone in Meyer's class taken the exam yet?
never have i been so afraid of something in my life
mmm i don't know 
it's most likely not as intense as MUTH101 since it's for non-majors

no, chem bad
chem horrible
If girls are blocking you man, continuously pinging them is a bad look
No she's supposed to unblock me every Thursday
This is why I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have ig or tiktok cause I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want anybody seeing the stuff I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m posting and looking at
The example doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to me.
EEs are best engineering major prove me wrong
EE isn't tangible enough
Hence chemical bad
like high school kid build a car, not impressive. high school kid designing his own integrated circuits in his garage, impressive. http://sam.zeloof.xyz/
Does case have like a collective lost and found
Lost my airpods case üò≠
I mean designing circuits isn't too hard, making ICs is
go read horowitz and hill and tell me circuit design isn't hard
and even if they were just digital logic you still have to spend a ridiculous amount of time doing dumb stuff like optimizing gate geometry and sitting at a VNA tracing Rdson
its still EE
circuit design is still hard
circuit design is hard.
well did you declare it yet
not yet too scared
Well yeah, but you basically said "those 2 things are based on load so you can't really use them to filter"
but not scared enough to take 20 credit hours in one semester?
load is the first thing, but there's still a lot of narrowing down
EE is hard.
Never said it wasnt
it is illegal to be EE without having a god complex yk
in order to survive engineering school you need to work together with your fellow engineers regardless of major
Oh yeah forgot about that
Oh I know. The EtherCAT controllers I was working with over the summer had a 96 week lead time. I had to buy eval boards and use our bga stuff to pull them off
We joked about having the only ones in the US, but it probably wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t far from the truth
Don't care
Isn't that like 122 but not
I'm considering it. Idk whether to take PHYS 122 with Mathur or PHYS 124 with Rosenblatt
Phys 122 sucks
Fair enough I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never heard of them
i didn't understand what you wrote
Cuz u b catching an attitude sometimes jenine
U can have either one ü§£ü§£
i don't want to jinx myself ty üíÄ
i could tell her i have a bad headache ~~which i do~~
but i'm missing next week's meeting
And dont pay attention
it feels like 11 pm
actually i haven't fell yet
not yet
@_frostyyyyy_ I would never
are you serious
Too bad I never asked
well, im still lagging behind and i feel like a humanities major in disguise soo
like im doing this as i go and i still dont know how to make and why i need a test class
I mean, if you feel that in general then that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something else
You basically have a class named TestSalaries for example
doesnt matter im not gonna finish
i dont wanna do this anymore
Tho it's pass awareness month so I don't get any benefits
im crying in tink rn
i just dont like stem anymre
I failed the fuck outta my exams today
Maybe I should say it here: idk if someone has been going around and saying shit abt me. But I'm really trying my best to be a better person. I'm sorry if I ever made any of y'all uncomfortable. Cuz of ASD I'll never be 100% aware of social cues and what I'm saying. If any of y'all ever hear something outrageous abt me, fact check it first pls. I've already had someone spread made up things earlier this month.
I shouldn't be up this late and my mind is not running very well
I just kinda fucked up the very last page
Fucking
Hate
No I just assumed someone went around and told people to avoid me
Just wondering why
My classes are closed üòÇ
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably more sections of phys 2
the sages i want is half full :blurryeyes:
i want it so so so bad

i can save it up for you if it doesn't clash with my other classes
i don't have any since i'm not taking stats :LAUGHING:
i'm looking at sis now and there aren;t a lot of options o.o

OH GLLL
Enrollment is almost as stressful as exams tbh
I feel like I should√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve declared already but im lazy
can't procrastinate any longer :LAUGHING:
lol the sages i want has 2 seats left
Do we have to move all our shit out for winter break?

i think we can leave everything
i think we have to empty our trash and recycling tho
the sages i wanted are already gone
Time to pick a boring sages so I get a spot
the sages i want has 8 seats left
Wtf did u just say @alexthedawg
my mom didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick up my call üòî
sorry
wtf cameron
theo wtf üò≠
It's full anyway so you probably won't be able to get in
Good question, I'm not sure but I have never seen classes without an instructor go over the limit since you need the instructor to approve it
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold
Omg I remember when Dhananjay and I ran into Cameron
This weather is ass
Cold, rainy and windy
anyone know what you need to get on a proficiency exam to place out of the course>
anyone know why SPECIFICALLY case wifi takes a while to get internet after joining it? my home wifi does not have this issue and i updated drivers so its no that

math 122 placement and physics 121 placement
i could be wrong
this is for math

I've seen many things, but never Confederate Arabic SpongeBob jewelry
290 is closed and Fu will only grant permission requests if he gets enough TAs. Do you have the prereq for 376? 221 is also full. A friend told me 285 is good and Loui will let everyone in
ngl I was trying to see how many classes i could theoretically fit into my schedule
since you probably can't get into those
I don't have a department specific advisor
nice guys we broke sis
when step-sis gets stuck
Doesn't get worse than that
omg
it keeps giving me script errors
like its trying to call a function and throws me an error that it doesnt exist
i got like 5 errors in a row when i tried adding something to shopping cart
What class?
idk it might not do the same thing every time
Based as fuck
ksl the day before the project is due
Has anyone taken Chem 111? I'm thinking of taking that course and was wondering if I could ask some questions about it before I make a decision.
what else you need to know
lots of crying and complaining
Thanks! I can't believe I missed that lol
Sorry for the ping
Is it more theory or math?
Just memories whatever they teach, nothing makes any sense, ur not supposed to learn anything from 145
Dawg wtf is the point smh
the only math equations necessary are very simple and straightforward, but it leans more towards a theoretical understanding of materials science
145 is the worst class I've ever taken in this school yet
Rip bro
Alp's teaching is not bad at all, in fact the materials science department practically begged him to stay because he was that competent
I guess it's
But if I work for an aerospace company I can effectively avoid that part of the industry... And if I run my own company and make enough money I'll hire someone like alp for more money than case can ever pay him (which is not much) to help me with that part of the problem
As u can see I hate Chem with a passion
I'm not the only one who hate that class lmao, I think he did get better in ur yr
she is short tho :thonk:
now is everyone feeling
So slow
i think sis broke
sad
wheel of death
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìare you sure you want to enroll√¢‚Ç¨
my one class with 1 seat left: üñïüèº
WHEEL OF FUCKING DEATH
this shit supposed@to be fast
MY ROOMMATE GOT HIS B4 ME WTF
the server is handling too many requests it doesn't matter how fast ur internet is
I know but isn't there supposed to be a queue
apparently
idk
that moment when you cllick 5 sec too early :(
all the sages i wanted filled up@like last week
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even try for sages
bruh still loading
Got them all except for pscl
quantitative methods class
damn
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in soci 101
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even count it as a real@class
they had like over 50% of the seats left
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have backups
its ok tho most r music classes so i really only didnt get 1 class
how they expect me finish my major if i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the required classes for my major
the class probably isn't actualyl closed it's more up to professor
Are you kidding me, it cut off my sages class and said I was over the limit but I was only at 17 credits
how many credits is enough per semester?
u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna be stuck overloading on credits in ur upperclassman years
i think to be considered a full time student you need at least 12 credits
wtf
What the fuck
is wrong
holy fucking shit
1700 people trying to use it at once
They really gave upperclassmen priority on basic major reqs instead of freshmen :PES_Rage:
yuh cuz they got the same issues as u
so now they need to take them as upperclassmen
idk what to do
I didn't get 233 but the max is 90 so im assuming that max enrollment isn't  a real limit
i guess
i feel like
everyone will be doing that tho
do u need help with figuring out what to taek
both i need for my major
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna do this anymore
i guess i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve registered for 4 classes
not really what i want
unfortunately
our school sucks
I guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna have an easier semester this spring
btw this class sucks if you wanna actually learn psych
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care ab psych
i am english major unfortunately
what are my gen eds i forgot
seems like something you outta talk with them
they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really do anything but
it kinda sucks being english major bc people take english classes for fun sometimes and take up those spots when i actually need them for my major LOL
and i fought for like the 3 spots left üò≠üò≠
last semester I requested 3 classes and got all of them so
damn
i guess i will do that now?
should i lie and say my computer crashed for sympathy
I NEED THESE CLASSES JEN
oh are we supposed to do that
if we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the class or it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s closed
Need it for major, behind schedule, etc
Today I learned you need to request permission to take 21 credits
Oh
Got them all except for pscl 101
austin wtf
nvm idk for sages man
got all except soci 101
WHAT ARE MY GEN EDS SUPPOSED TO BE??
might just have to suck it and take it next year
Sages is like upperclassmen shit
Ugh I wanted to get sages over with but whatever
but i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find it
its ok fuck sages
why the fuck are business and management classes so filled
I think I only have one class left for breadth requirements which is cool
and it will show u what u have taken that counts towards ur mzjor and what else you need
dawg what I need is to get this class so I'm not taking a basic req in my sophomore year
just altogether impossible to enroll now because fuck you
drop class then re-enrooll
cuz I have perms for my current section
the server can't handle less than 2000 users
seriously
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be sitting in my elective knowing I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve taken a required class insteadü§°
should i go back to sleep
electives are technically required courses tho
Feels like 5
I just want to know why
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it
And now there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no time to go back to sleepüòì
bs in CS, school of engineering
wtf
no, bad website
do you work in teams for CSDS 281?
probably the capacity is wrong and its actually 90
this is a millis lecture hall class
yes thats how it works unfortunately
i emailed one professor and he said he owuld work on issuing an override to let me in the class
if i dont get the other ones,
i guess 15 creds is enough
I didn't fucking get 233
And I fucking need it
even if i get his class
IDK WHAT ELSE TO TAKE üò≠ü•≤
request permission for a phed class
I DONT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD TAKE FOR BRERADTH
if you get in, the seniors will be so pissed
12 credits is still full time
I missed the part where I asked
this shouldn't be returned
reverse engineer that shit
FUCK SIS
FUCK THIS SHIT
If someone didn't get CSDS 233
i should take it again just to fuck with people
Don't fuck around like that pls :owo:
but idk if im allowed to take it or if it satisfies a breadth requirement
is that a rocks class?
bro I missed it üò≠
I'm sorry :(
rocks are hard
nah it's really not
üòÇ all my classes are closed
i got into logic organization and design when i haven't taken data structures yet is that ok?
guess i'm taking 4 credits next semester ü§∑
didnt you do this last registration period?
or was that someone else
i wasn't even gonna take all those classes but i'm throwing them all at the wall and seeing what sticks
i am hoping and praying that i get into 233
not in 233 though üòÇ
why did they think it would be a good idea ot have literally 90 slots for a class that all CS majors need to take when the class of 2025 has 1600 students
but still
make the class smaller = takes you longer to graduate = case gets more money
if anyone got into PSCL 101 with rita TTh 10-11:15 and is gonna drop it PLS reach out to me i need it as a requisite for music ed!!!
If u need to, u have to
If u don't, email the prof
It's a contender for the easiest class I've ever taken at Case
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a joke of a class
Snabbed that data structures class
hmmm ok not so bad then
idk how hard nutrition 201 is
my advisor tried to convice me to take that class lol
i just need it for gen ed req
fair enough
Requires little work
The diff Eqs class I enrolled in only has 12 people, if that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a bad sign I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what is
idk if online would be better or worse
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m only taking that many tho bc nutrition is online
What the fuck does this mean
Did you give the form to the office of undergraduate studies
I remember it happened to someone else on this server, I just can't remember who it was
yep you never have to go to class
oh damn
ooooo omg :0
ya i just need it for a quantitative reasoning class so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna work too hard
nvm i got a philosophy class for my gen ed
Don't knock it till you've tried it
Does the social media platform happen to be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTRUTH√¢‚Ç¨
I'm still working on the specifics, but it's supposed to be a local decentralized social network. I wanna see if such a thing would actually be sustainable.
i dont control the roles but i can make a channel :D
Right, but it's still got a central server behind it
BTW, I'm pretty sure that without at least some central effort, what I had in mind won't work because of how Case's wireless networks are made up
Man first one just sad
if you are passionate about nothing, go into accounting
Cuz for a good app for the public, u at least need a central server to publish updates
you would have to create some structure that wouldn't allow for too much tinkering
Tinder is very decentralized far as I'm aware
I forgot not all applications can be accessed through desktop
Either way there's not many exploits to be made
Every message is cryptographically signed, so even if they're stored locally I can't modify them when distributing
then I realized, tinder doesn't have a desktop client
My dad scolded me for a good 30min cuz I spent money on it
Major declaration form for anyone who needs it
isnt it spring 2022 for freshmen?
Is SOCI 101 hard?
Whoever cares about discrete math it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s open rn
PSA, fuck you @alexthedawg
the class only has 8 students enrolled out of 60 max
which class is that
I dont think the other professor is hard but I heard Hutcherson was good+his rating is higher i think
i wouldn't be surprised if the class got cancelled
i was going to take it but not anymore :LAUGHING:
btw i don't think i'll be taking that class anymore so
and i don't think david is gonna take linux either
wow y'all are leaving me alone
we don't like you jenin
Probably not taking Linux, my schedule is Physics 2, Probability, Artificial Intelligence, some easy class, and either Math of Data Mining or Computational Perception
no i'd rather stay alone
It does sound interesting, I'm so torn trying to choose between Math of Data Mining and Computational Perception
oh when did you declare
but literally now i'm considering switching to BA
will discuss with advisor soon though
Apparently, it's brutally difficult
guys everyone be jealous of me because priyanka and i are sages besties next semester üåö
i'm jealous
did you take that awful aids class too
He told me that the professor said that too many people were getting A's so the professor increased the number of homework questions by like 50 percent lol
we want to be doctors
why do you hate data science
i don't, computer science is just better
@kaori_flute i just enrolled in linux so i might actually end up taking it idk
omg
I havent even met jenin yet and she's already bullying me
open ur eyes you take math together
why does everyone want aids
what a shame
you aren't really missing out on anything
@denoris i been playing some mahler on the public piano in Thwing, I don't think anyone recognize it yet. Still waiting for that day
it's very sad
Still a mystery who's that absolute French horn chad I heard earlier this sen
someone in my dorm is constantly playing the spongebob theme on their piccolo
OK wasn't u
not sure if shes teaching it next sem but she gives all the questions to the exam before each exam and goes over them with you in class
havnet heared ab hutcherson but i doubt they give exam questions before you take exam LMAO
anyone who has taken 122 or 132 before how do u recommend studying for final
there is also the math gala the day before
Doesn't he publish review stuff
idk when
The math122 website
I kinda wanna start studying now
Whats math gala
Oh
Does he post past final exams?
i don't remember
and you don't have to attend the whole thing
just go for the topics you want to cover
10+ hours iirc
i don't know how will that be in person though :LAUGHING:
~~the longest time i've ever did math in one setting~~
but it's really helpful
and again, you go for the topics you want to look at
Bless Math Gala
having said that, STUDY BEFORE IT
Because you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Yeah I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cuz I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel like it
I think the espresso is still in effect
Kicks in at the worst times
I DO NOT want someone remotely setting it to 100% and I wake up to it drilling for oil in my bottom at 4am

Can you pull John to the side and tell him my glasses broken in my previous lecture hall 
I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to go to class because I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see and need to get them fixed
If anyone who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in wants it
anyone in math 122: which problems on the mpods are we supposed to do cus i think the pdf he posted is for both wednesday and fridays lecture
And since he didn't give a number, there's technically no mpods "due" until after Friday's lecture
I've never done a single one of them
they help with studying 
esp if you need to understand what's going on
It seems to me that all of them are doable with today's knowledge...
i was able to do through 5
cant do 6 though i have no idea how to find the center
I skipped so many classes this sem but I don't think I missed anything
Nothing lowkey about it
@Deleted User he wants all the smoke üòÇ
Isn't that even more sus
Aw hell naw someone fucking in the showers
at least in tyler they only fuck on the third floor balcony
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so many worms on binary walkway
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even see ur text i was just like damn that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a lot of worms
also @rubek we met and i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize because jen didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t introduce you
Because I am a spring admit and I have yet to arrive on campus
I have to fix CIM√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s printers too now
Wtf

oh i meant like ride to the airport
I know someone going there but she's a senior this prob way too awkward
U leave 3hrs before ur flight
normally i get to airport like 1:30 before flight
u kno the rta train from little italy literally goes right to airport right?
yes i know but it takes an hour and i dont have enough time to take it after my last class
I was laughing inappropriately hard at this meme
np i didnt read it like that LOL
honestly tho im thinking might be worht to skip my last class anyway
just email the teacher and say your dog fell over
i do have a dog
also shes leaving like an hour earlier than i want to this time
Ya dude the train isn't bad
i dont have the pass thing tho
Honestly dude I dont think I've ever showed it to a worker I just be going up the stairs
i didnt know they were still handing them out
Honestly I dont see a reason why they won't give u one
if i miss my flight
if I didn't know what sleeting was I'd assume it was some weird thing kids did to get high

Blasting Mariah Carey in November is a form of torture, so its fair game
i forgot my earbuds :(
does anyone know how to get to the airport?
I think on Google maps it shows u stopping at the stop b4 the airport station thats y
From what I remember it brought us right to the airport
you ride the shuttle that's going west until the last stop 
you hop off right in the airport
Ah well I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come anyways if I knew what it was
ehh i didn't go either
I googled it and it sounded fun. Wish I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sicker than a dog though
ah man that sucks. take care my dude
Bruh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on an rta train and some guy went in between the cars while the train was moving and took a piss onto the tracks
Airport one

If you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look at your grades they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hurt you
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a reason
My mental health improved drastically when I stopped looking at my grades tbqh
i still look at my grades
but i don't feel anything about them anymore
literally. i stopped checking grades on the weekend as well
if i get that "Exam graded" email im ignoring tf outta it
till monday
Bruh I got a calc 3 test graded last week and I still ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even peep the grade
I have a 92 in the class but I did not feel good about the test
i dont think anyone really wants to know how many dislikes their video got
U don't have to be a right winger to do that, but likely yea
https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1463006775322587136?s=20

This how I feel about it
I use youtube to look up tutorials for math and science
I legit need the dislikes to see if they helpful or not
I thought that was already established
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m lazy as fuck
Scrolling takes too much time though
how do you not look at the grade when you get a test back on paper
So youtube claims removing the dislike button helps smaller creators, who can still see the counts. It will also likely result in "dislike" comments, which would be arguably worse for creators. And don't let the viewers use it to judge a video. gg youtube, you got it all backwards
"Coordinated dislike attacks" aka youtube rewind was shit and nobody liked it and they got butt hurt. Also maybe political things
Am going home sadly
@tsunderratedd we got a math quiz today right?
Door isnt open yet
Yeah fair
What, they don't sell meat?
Idk that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m asking
It's not a terribly large selection though
They have the basic meats and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all I need
And yet I went to get basic chicken tenders and I ended up getting the meatless variety üíÄ
```The thing about Ohio is that's it's like 5 different distinct regions of the US. There's NE and the most eastern parts of southern Ohio which is just straight up Appalachia. NW Ohio which is as Midwest as the Midwest gets. And southern Ohio which might as well be south of the Mason Dixon. There's North Central Ohio right on the lake which isn't dissimilar to places like Maine. And central Ohio which is like half Midwest and half South```
Now I don't wanna go to class
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lol
I fell asleep in math in the morning so I decided to actually sleep instead of going to chem
i just never went
Having class today is cringe
Class is cringe
Having a class is cringe
end of sentence
Man little Italy really doesn't ID u
Really shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be giving info out on here man üíÄ
I'm sorry to hear that

You don't need a degree in Russian studies to figure out what the sign says

I legit can't *not* read it

upperclassmen are annoying
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re jealous cuz they did not make use of thinkbox when they were freshmen
ive never been to thinkbox
Ok wtf that's so fucked up
She called me a rich college student who has never seen hardship
Close to the wet dry
She got taken away dw

She's gone is the important part
damn
im desparate ive been trying to fix it for an hour and a half
perferably one who hasnt talked in a long time
Also @denoris if you haven't gotten that problem sorted yet you can DM me
if it's about whether u should keep going i have some useful wisdom: don't.
oh ty
someone said toes
on butler's mpods he keeps putting "area" "triangle" "parallelogram" but the problems are 3D vectors
I feel like skipping every single class this week
Don't feel, just do it. I've been doing that for a whole semester
And last semester
I only go to class on Tuesday and Thursday
No because the one class I have on tue and thur r not recorded and the mf doesn't post anything on canvas
Measurements lab, strength of materials (Statics 2), fluid mech, engineering analysis (basically math)
Go to class, you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be teaching yourself new materials when finals are next week
But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the class where I dont need to take a final tho :hmm:
Yea but you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want it to affect your studying during finals
When I leave if yall r still in Norton or sumn ill stop by
im starting to think my major is contributing to my unhappiness
Switch to Chemistry, that will fix it
No hate to biochem majors out there
Holy fucking shit who asked
FUCK
Yes hate to biochem majors, chemical bio reigns supreme
Oh shit the garbage bin is talking
wtf is the difference
biochem for people who dont like to do math
FUCKING
FUKCINg WHy DOES THAT HAPPEN
i feel so bad
sorry üòî üëâ üëà
I still have to take math
Biochem majors don't have to very much chemistry at all
also wtf why is bio an adjective if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s basically a bio major
I'm taking a biochem core class rn because I can take their classes
math 125 and math 126 aren't real math
fake math
to prove u can do math
I can't do math
i didnt think so

the yt vids didnt help
It won't be on the final
Holy fuck why would you wipe your asscheeks with paper towels and then throw your shit towels into the trash can instead of flushing
It smells like a fucking war crime
*How do you expect him to find out*
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry üòî
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remind me about thatü•≤
You're right, it's√¢‚Ç¨¬´ stupid

Kinda weird that you would automatically jump to the conclusion that I would judge her based on her look tho üòêü§î

My bad for that. Internet calls her √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmid√¢‚Ç¨ all the time. Assumed that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what you were doing
I mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a huge fan of Johnny Depp but I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go around praising him if he appeared in the next pirates movie and has like 0 line and only like 10 mins of screen time

Dang missed it
someone go to the physics hw si session with me
Is it still happening?
i ended up going w someone teehe
ohhh no it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
for 121 it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
When does class enrollment end
im starting to question what has compelled me to believe that i was cut out to do stem
oh no yhis was induced after the first round of exams
finals only exacerbated it
what stage are you in? i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìspun around in my chair for the last half hour and now i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m too dizzy to keep reading√¢‚Ç¨ phase
im in the "FUCKING TRANSFER" phase
they will. they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re coming and there is nothing you can do about it. it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too late to run
i don't know...
oh right I was thinking of 122, apparently the SI for that one woke up and had no voice so the session got canceled
wtf lol
I'm taking 122 next semester though
i say you take a step back now
don't dwell too much
i think i am going to dissociate and submit my unfinished coding project bc i have already been wallowing at the bottom and i have more important shit coming my way
When I took Java, Professor Connamacher didn't allow late submissions for the final project because the next day was a reading day and he said we should be studying for our finals on that day and not working on our project
Oh

Atheism leaving Robin when there's a chem final

i'm about to fall asleep

i woke up at 2pm today
i don't feel bad anymore
last night
dont recommend that combo
i slept for 13 hours roughly
Bio wasn't that bad at all
That explains why I ran out
My sages final paper is turning into an 8 page rant with no real argument and I already know the professor won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell the difference anyway
hey can one of the admins catch this so everyone sees it but the RTA train to the airport isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t running to the little Italy stop so you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna have to either find where the rta buses they subbed in are, go to the Cedar Uni Stop, or get a Lyft/Uber
That's the worst place I can think of
If hating Florida is wrong ion wanna be right
Not that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong

For anyone still in cleveland holy hell is it pouring outside
So fucking windy too
Get yall shit charged just in case the electricity goes out üò≠
hannah isnt ur flight at 6 pm
why did u get there so EARLY
i was really nervous
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never flown before :(
only if its a headwind  on the ground tho
or a tailwind in the air
I once narrowly escaped death in a heavy airplane, full cross wind 9kts above plane's max demonstrated cross wind
Never again
It was kinda rainy so we had some turbulence
Depends on the airline tho
I just went on and did the flight
Bro our gate got changed to the terminal with spirit airlines and I was like ew gross I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be seen here
It was really weird
It maxed out the time I took off and just died down
i cant read metar
yet*
And I'm already instrument rated
I know the examiner can't even read it so he let me pass
Oh yea he really let me get away with some shit
I got hit in the face by a 30 mile an hour leaf
Ope math 126 final grade is out

ive been conditioned to believe showers are stressful i hate college
And my bare feet touching the ground? What the hell
i forgot how little stress showers are at home
Hey does anyone know how to possibly reach a navigator or schedule an appointment on the weekend? I have a final tomorrow and I'm sick but my professor asked for documentation but idk how to get it
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still dealing with the after math
So I can't go to a doctor tomorrow before the test
Have you tried explaining that to your professor? @_frostyyyyy_
Depending on what he answers 
You can go to UHS at 9 (i.e miss the test) and send the verification to him right after
You might have to email undergraduate studies depending on the professor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s response and when are you gonna ve able to do the test
I'll just take the test since my symptoms aren't too bad right now, I just wanted to let him know in case I got a lot worse soon
Yeah I slept for 8 hours today after only getting 5 hours two nights ago since I was rushing to finish a SAGES essay üòÇ
I got booster and flu on the same day around noon and my only side effects were chills that night. So I guess 1 day and I was good
Yikes get more than 8 if you're sick
I slept for 14 hours 2 days after I got my booster and 11 the day before
I have trouble sleeping early even if I want to
i got my booster on thursday and slept for 10-13 hours until like
i have never managed to sleep more than 5 hrs all semester üò≠
i guess we'll never know
My flight is on the 3rd üòÇ
U can sleep on my couch if u got here to early lmao
I just found out, out of all the awful wine Plum sells, they actually have something very very based
They really don't care, whenever paperwork is involved, whoever writing them will always wanna minimize the trouble
A literal dog
What classifies as a self defense weapon, bc I'm going to have an exacto knife to work on crafts
idk how to study for java
That sounds like a horrible way to study for Java üò≠
Just go over the study guide he gave us
fuck you @alexthedawg
i cant even write out code properly whagtmakes anyone think i could answer the damn questions
If you really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know where to start what I would do is look at the question, go to the lecture notes to find the answer, write it down, repeat
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re allowed to open or move stuff
Good make sure they can't move without moving stuff
someone get L3 with me :CB_angery_cry:
i wonder if jen wants someone to go to L3 with them
I WANT AN L3 BUDDIE üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
idk like a stun gun, knife, or pepper spray
So you mean to tell me they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be looming inside my drawers?
then they can't enter.
That's gonna be problems if you don't put it away
they can't open the door without breaking covid regulations
they could always wipe it down. we need to think bigger
technically, you aren't disfiguring anything
fuck the doorknobs all you want
ur telling me you can't shove a doorknob up your ass theo?
youre allowed to do whatever to YOUR property(guts) as long as it doesnt disfigure or deface not yours
Oh shit
DAMN IT ROBIN
dont die
if you have to turn it in a little late your prof probably wont care
@rsgsockcheck racist piece of fucking shit
oh no what did i miss
50 minutes left 5 pages
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe in you robin
i forgot to change it
if u have an essay due in one fucking hour
who asked tho fr fr fr fr fr
yeah and i bet u didnt proofread it at all
if theres one class i know for a fact ill fail
java bad
i really want to take java and them turn in all my assignments in kotlin
i dont think that makes it any better considering the midterm wasnt great for me either üò≠
uh oh
No time crunch at all, a lot of people turned it in early, tons of extra credit
that makes it worse
Level of pain ofc

damn
She and her husband let thousands of people die during the aids epidemic

i aint tryna miss my flight
Nope
No problems at all
but i dont want to take rta at 5:30am id rather get an uber 30 minutes later
i wish the rta was like 50% faster
Bc if you scheduled it like 3 days in advance they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let you know the details till like 12ish hours b4
Aren't our grades supposed to be logged onto sis today?
nvm I'm a fucking stooge
I've gotten more grades late more often than not
Even though it's past the deadline for all of them
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still waiting on one class for a grade and another hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put it in sis but i know my grade
there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no way my sages prof grades 36 essays turned in on a rolling basis from november 29 to december 10
im one of the only ppl left in my dorm its so sad

Just finished watching blue period and now I'm sad
dont spoil, still have to watch
My jaw is on the fucking floor I'm sorry
Uh oh
Covid isn't even real smh
ok so ive been told the moderna booster makes u feel shitty and im scared
I mean it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s essentially the same as the original vaccine (which isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even a vaccine)
I fucking hope
as long as Wyant's open I don't rlly care
when i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave my room my depression decides it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s free real estate
gyms get shut down 3head
walking to class is less suffering than trying to understand from a screen
aint no fukin way boa
oh noooo
I left most of my keyboards in my dorm
One to One will never shut down
man I ain't walking all the way to 121
sucks when you're an employee
oh ok that's not too bad then
This shit is sooo good
Down the throat like honey
final grades totally aren't due in 8 hours
Well despite making the deadline Connamacher hasn't put in final exam grades yet ü§∑
I have two classes without grades in right now
my last one just put in grades
Tbh it really still is the TA's fault because we legit got the grades done ~10am today
my chem and java grades aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in yet
Lol sorry
I think Connamacher is working on the final exam grades
So far none of them are in yet
weebcon missed connections
Oops wrong pic
lemons on the chain with the v cut
bro they fucking laugh till I pull up in my lemon car
someone from rhode island came thru the drive thru today
I don't think we will be if most people get the booster
omg
they were like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe drove 3 hours for this and now we are gonna drive 3 hours back to rhode island√¢‚Ç¨
idk any rhode islander that would do that
a rhode islander who wants white castle
people hate driving here
i hate rhode island being outside here makes me extremely anxious
I suffered thruogh the hell on online classes once I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t doing that agaian
i don't want online classes ever again pls ty
Yep that helps! I got mine last week! (It was a pain for a few days, but after that it was fine)
I got mine a few days ago and my arm felt sore for a day or two but that was it
Nothing wrong with ur cheating if ur trying to defeat the capitalist cog fr fr
I cant hear u
Go fix ur dam
Ok I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to stay here and take this
If u hate hearing Palestinians voice their opinions then say so
This is deeply irresponsible and I would never do such a thing myself, if I may interject.
OMG that knockout against Tyron woodley
vicious as fuck
don't remind me
Imagine if Connamacher just literally can't put them in anymore
The deadline passed
Still waiting for my algorithms grade too
Last fall sem ended a little bit later than this one but I got my grade for Java on Christmas of 2020
Is anyone still on North side?
The final exam grades are not in yet
can they never be?
Damn that looks good
@alexthedawg fuck u
Please anyone knows if Wade is open cuz I have 2 packages in packcite rn that I bought bc I didn't expect the mf to arrive so fast

I cant
Jenin is mean as shit smh
UR MEAN FOR MAKING ME FEEL BAD
probably didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have space
idk where they are putting you but y'all now gotta put up with the force of nature that is suite 430
i've lived in both and this is wrong
the only bad part about living in tippit is that @kaori_flute is directly across from you
You forgot about ants in your common room
Oh and y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s power switch, tv and bathroom door shocking me with static electricity
Ok adam is right on that cuz people 4th floor taplin didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to use the bathroom
i mean last year there was blood on the toilet seats and that's not a guy problem
i deadass dont remember having an ant problem and year you probably do win
yeah it was really chill last year tbh
Except for shower salads
all i'm saying is I've lived on multiple "male floors" for the past 3 semesters and I've never once seen blood in the bathroom
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never seen blood in the bathroom
BAHAHAHA I FORGOT ABOUT THIS
one time someone on my floor threw my airpod in the trash
The name taplin gives a home feeling
Like 5 people got super pissed at each other over laundry
sorry replied to the wrong person
I am so sorry you are living in south side as a freshman
you want the bagels?
I feel bad for some people
probably ran out of room in nrv
wishing to be a spring admit rn
Not fair
I heard, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only 1 minute away from Tippit :fingerguns:
But they want to switch cs they ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t with other freshman LOL
Oh nvm then
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually a single suite, I thought I would be in the same room with my roommate, but we ended up being neighbors
OH THEIR SUITE IS 150???
Kai, Hunter, and my √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsupposed√¢‚Ç¨ roomate, Arshia
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spoken to him in a while
damn i didnt even know 150 was a thing
Be careful of ants though :LAUGHING:
Idk if they go into dorms tho
they made them a strip club then they died
yeah i had ants and i made them a strip club and then they died
hoping and praying
Pls I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to attend Zoom Reserve University
also I left all my keyboards there
I LEFT MY SWITCH
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sad
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t park there
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m actually moving in alone :crii:
how cold is it there? bc ppl say its cold, but i doubt its that bad
do i need to have a parkaaa
It gets pretty cold. Routinely in the 30-40√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and lower in the winter with wind
Tippit bathroom door never fails to
Seems so for most classes
Damn
FUCK
But honestly remote classes aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gonna stop that
Also from my observations people are very bad at keeping their masks on during class
Not everyone but like damn
Without covering with your arm or anything?
There is only one person, in my anatomy class, whom I stare daggers at because he wears an N95 but under his nose
And I have other stresses going on right now that I don't need that
Surprised I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten sick yet
I mean the flu goes around every year
I was a hermit during the flu season loll
Covid vaccines are more efficacious than influenza vaccines though
meeting my roomie for the first time + being stuck together for two weeks woooo
Additionally, they got sick at an incredibly high rate compared to everyone else
Speaking of religious exemptions, what really counts as a religious exemption?
afaic most Christian denominations don't really have anything against vaccines
i don't wanna go back to remote classes üò≠ üò≠ üò≠
shit haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t thought of that
Cuz everything√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s booked where I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m staying
Idk if you have to tell them
i don't wanna imagine taking classes online in my tiny sophomore room
Cuz me studying alone = never studying
There will be follow-ups. I'm just really hoping that my research doesn't get turned into mush by Covid
This is so fucking annoying.
I wish things got better already
Yeah, this is now my 3/4 year of college that I've had remote classes in
How√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s everything else gonna work tho
I just really hope that we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go back to lockdown or completely remote
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna absolutely lose my shit
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry for being a freshman
Oh goodness
Ummm true  but ppl could be responsible? Right probably not, so hopefully they won't let ppl eat  in close proximity
I think there mayhaps be a regulation that will not stay regulated bc college students are menaces
On how many can go in
I mean, we need food. Also paying for it already, so like makes sense in a way
Idk it'll be to-go instead of dine in
I feel like we can only make it 2 weeks by being responsible
If we go back to where we were then in person dining will be severely limited to one per table and it will be mostly take away
Without installing security cameras at every corner of every oor
praying that my roomie doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have early morning classes
the way it was last year, most people would take out food
It's not enforceable, but the threat of online school hits pretty hard
Two weeks also will give the majority of people who need boosted to get up to full effectiveness
Ik Iots of peeps who prefer online though
they need to get their brains checked
Me and online school don't like each other
I don't learn shit
I think online school is way easier but I don't learn shit
i tried to like online school but she didn't like me back :sadcat1:
For studying
i don't want to continuously sit on my desk staring at my laptop
I wasn't aware this wasn't what you do anyway
I just want lab
I'll just study downtown tho 
That's where I go anyway
I want to study my viruses
Damn
I don't think I've seen Jenin either üíÄ
What a life
I see her sometimes in the morning cuz I have math after her class
I'll prob pass ppl and never know you were someone I spoke to on discord
most ppl don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show their face so I have no idea how
Howdy recognized me and I didn't even know
yet you never said hi :nkosad:
we never hung out though :sadcat1:
I've walked past you way too many time without saying hi tho üò≠
one time i stared directly at my roommate and we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say anything to eachother
just prolonged eye contact
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talk i just say wesley and move on
LMFAO the crying pepe
I want these powers of recognition
only vaguely though
here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my dog
Fuck
Zoom... fuck kk
I can't remember ppls faces from those zooms unless I see them again periodically
people i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think people can pick me out of a lineup
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìare you hannah shindler?√¢‚Ç¨ and i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know who the hell they are
i did put the cwru flag behind me to hide my depression room

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna start wearing button downs for everything now cuz I cannot have my wardrobe

I got the worst chills of my life but they went away after I started doing meditative shit
after first shot, fine, second shot, chills and soreness all over couldn't even stand, lasted for 3 hours the night after the shot, booster was fine day of again, day after i was sore and was super hot all day, felt super bad after booster, but lasted only a day and yknow def better than not getting it
First shot was just sore arm
Second shot I had three symptoms for three days 
Booster I took yesterday and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m suffering
It got a bit better tho, but still can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything üò≠
Took the booster today feeling fine but might feign sickness tomorrow to get out of work üòÇ

What's wrong with Uncle Kendrick ü§®
i'm being called 400 miles away what
I don't think anyone does
oh damn
Why they shoot him in da leg tho
I mean stealing a car seems cheaper than buying one
Usually shootings or bigger Robberies such that there isn't a vehicle description
~~But aren't guns banned in Italy~~
I assume the mob is taking a cut, cuz otherwise this is unacceptable for them
Cuz of Joe biden
They can't afford gas so they steal a car with a full tank
When trump was president we never got calls from case about robberies
~~ignore some of us not being admitted yet~~
Bro why a 12 year old shooting a guy and taking his car
So many incidents since break started...
I really don't get how
Joe Biden personally robbed me at gunpoint and stole my car
we be relatively close to east cleveland so would not be surprised :ohgod:
Holy shit
I was gonna tag someone but I think that'd be really extra
U don't need to buy an extra amp
But it also won't give u anything extra
I need some audio splitter and a high pass filter
Why do u need a subwoofer
I'm still negative
nah the vaccine don't work, it's all a government ruse to get microchips in you
Unfortunately I have been owned and now have influenza
sucks to suck i got my flu shot too
flu shot buddies
Hannah sorry about saying you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re from NJ
I forgot lmao
new jersey is arguably the worst state
you think ohio is bad, come to syracuse new york
my friend almost went to school in syracuse
what school was it
she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go there
new jersey is actually not that bad
esf not bad
detroit is prob worse
Worse than Cleveland
and where i live isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even that fun or touristy
Florida weather reigns supreme
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been happier anywhere else
Florida's got bugs tho
rhode island has so many mosquitoes it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so terrible
Isn't that because east of campus is kinda dangerous?
apparently he was a chem professor
and he'd deduct points on tests
if you don't answer any questions on the test, you get a 0
but if you answer one question and it was wrong, you get a negative grade
Lol wtf
may he RIP üôè
I got my flu shot
Yeah that seems like a wanna be sat subject test grader
i said flu shot buddies because i literally got my flu shot with jen
I signed up for three just before they were getting rid of them for college admissions and then i just never took them ü§™
Oh
OH
i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve failed them so hard
I wasted so much time studying for my math subject test only for it to get canceled and removed lol

Probably not yet, have EA/ED gotten their results?
I saw someone from my hs got in
Most likely not then, I checked Student Hub and there's no server listed there either
apparently they found out 12/21 for ea, 12/11 for ed
People on Reddit are saying that you could stay home for the first 2 weeks if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have lab or PE
From what I understand, everyone is supposed to come at the beginning of the semester
Since if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re roommate tests positive for COVID, doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that put you at risk?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just wondering if they have a protocol for that
Doesn't appear to be the case although I do remember some people isolating or quarantining off campus last year
because even if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a roommate you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still exposing your floormates
It says stay in your room as much as possible
Wtf
cuz people are vaccinated so they're not going to take measures like last year
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
And what if you don't? Who's going to stop you?
They probably won't because you're paying for it anyways
~~that's something one would have to answer to the student conduct office~~
I think in one of the Case webinars, the staff said that there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a 6-hour buffer window between when a student receives a positive test and when they get escorted off campus
So if you get a positive test result in the afternoon, you still spend the night in your dorm, expose your roommate, and leave in the morning lol

Guys the new matrix is not that bad
The 3rd one is not that bad either
for a long time I thought it was like smith couldn't handle his power or something
the machines try to stop people from escaping because they know if they don't the rest of humanity will suffer
and they're actually trying to be humanity's caretakers
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse is they have the moral lower ground too
I didn't understand why they complained about the food and whatever when they can just have someone spoonfeed them that crap as they're jacked into the matrix thinking they're eating beef wellington
Still hate the fact that they made an distinction between the matrix and real world
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s someone at the Orlando airport wearing a case mask

Covid isn't real anyway we b ight

There will b someone there

Probably during the hours
bro this is a terrible idea just having us to it in wade/frib was better
Imagine your Covid test gets stucküòÇüòÇ
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never do anything bad cmon

shit

Oh shi, fr? Aight then :howdy_hattip:

just go on a cloudy day so you don't get heat stroke
yo does anyone know if the rta bus goes to micro center, or where I can find out if it does?
I went there yesterday and got the glorious mousepad, it sucks to see the prices of gpus still so high tho
dont bring your stuff on the bus
you have to walk a good 10-15 mins depending on ur pace from the stop to the dorms tho, so keep that in mind if you have a lot of shit
The RTA stop has previously had a history of crimes such as but not limited to armed robberies muggings etc
This is to save you from walking in the cold and the dark to the dorms
my toxic trait is thinking i will never be a victim of a crime
essencially a mini taxi service that runs from 6-2 that can take u places around campus, its useful for when the weather is shitty or its like 1am and u dont wanna walk
Although, 14" laptop vs full desktop soooo
I went to sleep at 4 am during school
I have a very healthy sleep schedule where I'm in bed by 11PM, and make sure I get 8 hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about 20 minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning
Yo ngl I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m like dying to get back on campus. The break has been going on for too long üíÄ
HOWEVER I'm never setting foot out after dark ever again
cuz
I ain't trynna get robbed by a 15 year old man
https://gyazo.com/2633f3b672b4d9fd9450e010f7664173 I'm supposed to believe a student wrote this huh?

like wtf
stupid ass ratings

You should've taken POSC 334 with me
Wow damn they trynna use delta gamma for quarantining
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so funny and sad at the same time
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get bad news either
yo $2 for a pound of pasta is some chill tho
Someone got back their nitro huh
Its not bad but the aftertaste was AWFUL
also do people want to take bets on how long online classes will be? My bet is at least 2 months
Honestly that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably not too far off from what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going to happen this semester
the semester is longer than 2months tho
I don't think so
I have that game but I've never played it
1261 hours on record:NM3_PepeCry:
I broke my wrist and shoulder
Playing that game requires a shit ton of flickering your mouse and instead of moving my whole arm I flick my wrist
Same principle goes to shoulder after I stopped flicking my wrist
I'm just getting back into it and I already have a problem again
Boosters are extremely effective against omicron, and with the booster requirement I think that we'll see a large dip in cases around late February mid March. The reason that cases ticked up at the end of the semester is that a lot of people had been vaccinated in April or May and hadn't gotten boosted yet, so Late Nov early Dec were prime Rona hours
I don't think that we'll be all online
I havent played in like 3 months
adding to that, last fall people were not vaccinated yet (obv) and half campus did get filled
Last fall was a month ago Kevin
Honestly it'd be really fucked up if they go fully remote after everyone pays for room and board
Everyone will have their shots+boosters by then except for a few who got exemptions and live in uptown or sumn
I really hope we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stay remote for too long
Thats y after the 2 weeks I dont think we should stay remote
no need for masks
Anything more is probably a money grab
Masks aren't even that bad ill take that over remote bullshit
Cuz of CO2
It is MUH RIGHT as an 'MURICAN (literally am not tho)
Yall didnt hear
omg
i feel like there are more pressing freedom issues
i may be wrong
no cuz we still need them
oscar shut the fuck up
We dont need the vaccine
Masks are inconvenient at times but they are great whenever someone has a cold and they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna get others sick. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what they do in Asian countries anyway
So I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think masks will really ever go away
masks bad
I thought masks stopped infected people from spreading it as much
you thought wrong
No bc the masks licherally dont work
On the topic of politics, if anyone wants to to work for a PAC backing the democratic party lmk. They are paying like $15 an hour and flexible hours. Its short term like 1 month ish but still decent. Basically you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be phone banking, text banking etc to find strong candidates to run in elections against the competition.
My bad I meant on the topic of waging wars against Americans
oh mb :xCrittyx:
anyone here taken phil 306?
Worst part is, it was in response to a girl asking to see more pics of me

They wanna lose all the students that aren't backed by the fucking Rothschilds or whatever insert rich people here
It's literally the opposite of rule 5 tho :kermit:
Out of the loop here, can someone explain the dg situation?
But ya if anyone wants to recruit candidates to run for congress in northeast Ohio or know someone tryna run lmk
Oh

So the email says I need to submit a picture of my booster card by 7th but I'm not home until night of 7th so uh what I do

So this whole bubble shit won't be as effective
Some ppl dont give af fr

Yo, wanted to share some things USG got pushed through meal plan wise after multiple years of pushing, made possible through combined efforts of previous committees and also the food subcommittee. 
- Leutner and Fribley will close at 10pm instead of 8 like before.
- BRB cafe and HEC Cafe will accept regular swipes now open to closing time.
- Subway hours extended to take portable swipes from 8AM-3PM finally
- Taco and sushi place at Tomlinson will take portable swipes for an extra hour from 11AM to 3PM.
- Tink places (Pinzas, MeltU, PK) will also take portable swipes starting at 11am instead of 1pm. 

The meal plans just got a lot sweeter, these are things that took a lot of pushing for years but glad we got it done this year. 

Ps meal plans activate from January 9th dinner time.

Left Wyant a while ago
When does Leutner close?
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ate yet üòÇ
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so hungry tho
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very close
Have you ate yet?
Idk where that is
still good, but we're not missing out
l3 isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that bad
mmm now i want milkshake
@rsgsockcheck Could we meet at 9:30? I have to do something quickly before going to the gym. Sorry about the last-minute notice.
but I'll be there at 9 till close
idk
But idk
issa cold world we live in

Literally the door you see when you open the door
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m near the mirror
omg yousef
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seen you since coming back that feels illegal
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still open that late?
nah they closed at 12
but yeah everything is packed it sucks
@Deleted User are you in csds 132, chem 111, or math 121 this semester? I think I saw you in one of my zooms but I could be completely wrong
Fuck the new years resolutioners
like srsly, ain't nothin changed but the day and the year ü§£
Fr I see so many people there that just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing
i thought something was wrong with my zoom lmaoo
besties biol 215 is so note heavy i hate it
same lol, u didn't get credit
yeah I took it when covid first hit and my teacher didn't teach us anything past like arrays üò≠
oh dear
just cheated at the end >:3
but I got a 2 on the exam sooo
couldn't be me
why would i need to take chem106 as ee/compe
honestly drew isn't even that bad, just kinda sucks that we have to relearn everything, but that's part of college I guess. What other classes are you taking this semester?
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rub it in üò≠
oh my gosh
lemme just be 4 hours on a monday
bro youre gonna want to die
No I took it last semester
it's still 4 hours of physics
It's 3 its not bad
lab is every other week so not awful
mine barely spoke english
oh damn im only at 15 credits
they be doubting me but school is my only form of happiness
oh jen you're in math 224 class too
An elective cuz 22 is too many xoxo
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listen to the haters. You got this!
cant believe econ prof mentioned chip shortages and only mentioned cars and then talked about chip producers and only knows intel :crii:
my laptop gpu is 192 bit memory bus, some are up to like 384 i think
imagine if powerpc wasn't 32 bit
rip
although its not powerful enough to NEED that much bandwidth
being a 14" laptop and all
I'm just curious cause my laptop is unironically more powerful than my desktop üòí
wow that puts mine to shame
desktop or laptop
without increasing the voltage and it was stable
this is my laptop
cause gpus are too expensive
you mean 2060 mobile? aren't the mobile chips supposed to have nearly identical performance to their desktops counterparts now?
but mobile performance is hard to get from websites because power/thermal limits can vary a lot from laptop to laptop
yeah idk about that
laptop will ALWAYS be behind desktop because power limits
from laptop 3080
it's just super hard to generalize
as the gpu gets more powerful, the power draw increases a lot while laptop power draw cannot increase as much so the gap widens
idk
they don't want a single extra student ig
I just signed up for 102 last night so idk
OMG ECON IS AN OPTION
I might take econ idk
idk how he
's like in person tho
rip
Grible sucks
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I have a slot for Ernest
But that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so early
I have no idea how I'm going to stay awake for these classes
It's so cold outside
It do be cold outside
why can't classes just be in the morning
rip
My class today go all the way to 9:30 pm
It's once a week tho
Oscar I had lab go until 9:30 last semester lmfao
Which class
Rip
I was just saying rip because we have 102 at different times @.littlejimmy
Anyone want to grab lunch at Leutner?
In this weather?
Do we not eat because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold?
cold weather = more food
Motherfuckers be not re-racking their weights or putting them obviously where they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t belong
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still trynna find mine bro
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so far away bruh I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t walkin all the way there
U go right after class tho
Ive never been
I guess if you want to do aerobic exercise, it's also good
Would not recommend going for working out tho
Unfortunately I have to go there bc it's closest üò¶
I kinda fell off the workout train last semester Im tryna get back into it
It's easier to stick to a workout routine when you go with someone else
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have friends who work out is the issue üò≠
Maybe I could rope one in tho
Seems like shit√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s spreading p damn fast
Oh shit
So you have to work out harder
didn't i tell you? my nickname was autocorrector in high school
@.littlejimmy go shame em
if someone says it's 9:45 are you like um its actually 9:42
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do cardio
Cardio is for lame bitches
Be a bad bitch like me and only lift heavy
not at the moment though
Cardio is for people who want to live to an old age without the fear of developing some sort of dangerous heart ailment
I want to get into it. I just haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had time. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve watched half of part one
You don't need to be a fan to like the memes, I was gonna say
Yeah, I really liked it so far. I need to get back into it one day
I literally don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lol
I bet Oscar doesn't know the meme
what a fucking bitch
big takeaway - i am ass at everything, apparently
Do you mind sending the link? I tried to look on libgen and other websites and I couldn't find it @alexaces
it's been like that for at least 2 hrs
i'll slurp that shit like some gourmet soup ü•∂
seriously we said the fall passes end TODAY and we give out the spring passes starting at 11 am TOMORROW
You can't spell BEAST without rBST
but at least i can shower without creating a lake in the bathroom tho
no fuck you
Only on the inside :lovaaaa:
Omg I need a word with Sarah üòÇ
The only thing that might be weird is that I don't curse
PSA: come tot he housing office later in the day if you want to avoid any rush getting ur RTA passes, we start giving them out tomorrow at 11 am.
wtf
It's to prevent the servants of the emperor from fucking his concubines
But it's centralized and doesn't use a blockchain, or any cryptography for that matter
damn i cannot pay attention in zoom classes
they all feel a bit slower than in-person classes
Didn't he say he was speaking slowly on purpose for the live transcription or something?
he said he'd try to speak clearly but these random pauses are killing me
idk but this being on zoom is just worse
idk about yall but harold is struggling just as much
only bc his shit's rlly slow
There are some cryptocurrencies that are 1:1 backed by the US dollar though
That's nothing, in aerostructures we're getting random internet breakdowns
college in general is a mess
Data structures seems like a lot of work
i usually don't wear headphones because I'm in a single and I don't set my volume to an obnoxious level
sucks tho
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s day 4 and Wyant occupancy has gone down by about 50%
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when you lift through the pain and tear multiple muscles
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that üò≠
Holy shit that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s far
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know new year√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s resolution was a thing until I came to America
i know someone in quarantine housing and they were driven there
Oh hell naw they getting kidnapped fosho
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re getting sold on the dark web
My bad
Oscar, I like how you don't take anyone seriously
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too late to take pre though üòî
Robin, did Buddha end up showing up at Wyant?
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see him
he was on the treadmill most of the time tho
Oh
Luckily it ain't hit me no mo
No seriously
I've only been going for about 4.5 months now
Want to take sarms with me? @.littlejimmy
I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that desperate ma boi
During winter break for preworkout I had a scoop of gorilla and a grande cup of cold brew about 30 mins before a lift
and a bunch of other shit
a grande cup of cold brew also has 300 mg
cause the ck
and cold brew tastes better
they are bad don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bully me
Although I didnt know cold brew has 300
Thats embarrasing that shit does nothing to me wtf
I need a t break
No you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
What happened to u

Didn't ask
Damn

But we haven't gone to practice in like 3 months
Oh
Practices are usually monwedfri but idk how it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going since everything in person is canceled for now
That sucks tbh

She mad because she stink at it üò≠
I never said I got something against ping pong o_o
Oh shit
i dont see the issue if i am taking necessary precautions, and plus they wouldn't open it if it werent safe
I sat alone. Wyant is full of people who are taking their masks off and breathing heavily or standing and talking
Unmasked particles travel as far as 15 feet
I'll just stay 15 feet away from people

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little √¢‚Ç¨≈ìclever√¢‚Ç¨ comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

But you couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, and now you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

@alexthedawg Shut the fuck
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to hear this from an islamophobe
well shit
Most cases are asymptomatic though
and I'd rather not catch the cold
but IMO, getting something akin to a cold, or nothing at all is worth being able to attend classes in person
I try to not risk death, hybrid would be the best, but case doesnt care about students enough for thaylt
"A study, posted online and cited during a recent White House briefing, found patients with omicron had a 53% lower risk of hospitalization with respiratory symptoms, a 74% lower risk of ICU admission, and a 91% lower risk of death." -PBS
its not going away
shits eventually just gonna be the flu pt. 2
also when the school goes back to in-person, iirc they will always provide a zoom option
smh my head
Anyone want to cross check on PHYS 122 for this semester? Idk many other people in the class
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even started the hw üòÇ
seems legit
@kaori_flute why are you awake
Why are you awake at this hour
I got really thirsty
Cuz I'm wet
U were wet 4 hrs ago
Starbucks is too colonial for me I realized
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
I went to sleep one minute after
Are you still jetlagged? :wobble:
1:23 isn't that late for a college student
its like office hours today
did she extend the due date tho
It's only office hours, if you're having issues with modelsim
Damn
All this hate on Harold
its pain
Did you take it last semester??
oh shit i though we were talking about connamacher üíÄ
he gave us a study guide for the midterm and final and if you can do everything on that you should be fine
Install viruses on your pc so it can build up an immunity
Bread pudding from leutner kinda fire tho
and the rice isnt bad today either
Damn
damn who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that hottie
@.littlejimmy ive literally never pumped those deadlifts so hard my lower backs hurt
This why I don't deadlift lol
It's fucking 4:31
And my roomate is still loud as shit with his damn friends on COD
tell him to go the fuck to sleep
some of yall be stupid
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe I had a whole semester of sages with someone that likes ch*mistry :NM_peepoScared:
can harold just use an ipad like damn
@.littlejimmy I am but that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean chemistry and I aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t friends anymore
Why does dunkin close so fucking early
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do this
Why does it close at 5
My last class ends at 4:20 on Wednesdays and Fridays and I have classes back to back
lmaooo rip I thought it closed already
I finished my whole degree in chemistry last semester
I feel like a bunch of the material is just so out of context
We only learned about JFrame yesterday and did a whole lab on it today üòä
Sometimes I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe I joined the dark side but here I am doing comp sci
Harold didn't give me what I wanted but he gave me what i needed üò©
We need to get through java üòé
Ishika yes I feel like this is gonna be one of the worst parts
Apparently the Java reflection made one of my friends cry last semester she said it was hard
Or maybe it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the Java reflection idk
Oh no
I solved one of the short problems without any help at all and almost shit myself
I feel like whatever was taught in class did not align with the hw idk
Fuck that shit
Yeah well if we have to do it again during the semester that shit is getting yeeted into matlab
pretty much it lets you look at all the methods and properties of a class. tbh reflection wasn't that big of a deal for the midterm/final. at least for last semester it wasn't
matlab doesn't even matlab
Sorry but have to disagree, Swing kinda sucks ngl
I feel crazy for not liking matlab
Swing makes more sense 
You don't have to make a stage and call the gem stone of wisdom for a window to pop up
SHUT the FUCK UP
fuck you BITCH @alexthedawg
Go study
@Deleted User go the FUCK TO SLEEP
WTF

Maybe it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s vegan that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why it looks so bad
if i die√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

I'm jealous lol
Do some meal plans only let u go to leutner ?

the meal plan doesn't affect where u go
but don't they have the takeout boxes?? like the white ones
what happened to those?
They all went to Fribley

-My witness when I saw the defendant at another place when she was accused of being somewhere else and I waved to her and she didnt respond
It just further goes to prove my point that there isn't a Gay Taste in Music
All my friend plans got cancelled by the snow

Don't care + didn't ask + ratio + yb better
my prof stopped in the middle of class to tell us this
You make a fair point, unfortunately your mother is very fat
dr. haywood fully just let us out 15 minutes before the time we are supposed to end at
nope
i did csds 290 last year
Isn't that the Jack, Joseph and Mandel thing
Where the fuck is geller
sages class?
we still have second semester freshman forgiveness right?
Hawaii(very hot) right next to Alaska(very cold)
I grew up looking at a world map but it's hard to find PR
(never bothered to
isnt that like, the other side of south america
Lewicki is going to give me brain death
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m falling asleep dude
Glad I'm not missing anything
Holy fuck the data structures prof is terrible
He keeps saying the wrong thing and explaining things wrong and the exact same way when someone asks for clarification
how did you not know he was terrible for the past 2 weeks of classes
even worse now
idk it's just boggling my mind
this is the longest hour and 15 mins of my life
@alexthedawg wouldnt skipping negative numbers  not work for an array of all negatives? it would just return 0
he just said "nah i think it would work" and moved on
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not even paying attention I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just working on the project now üòÇ
What even is this algorithm trying to do again? Just finding the largest sum you can get with the numbers in a certain array?
i think im more confused after this class than before
If you have an array of all negative numbers can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we just return 0 because we can just choose a sub array of length 0? üòÇ
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all are still in big-O???
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see what wrong
Seems about right
Oh no
Then I realized
Oh no
Sorry, but this sounds sketchy lol
Tell me u hate urself without telling me u hate urself
As if my whole last semester of practically being dead in Dr Daniel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s class didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t scream that loud enough :aPES_Laugh:
I hate my sages this sem
STOP U WERE ALWAYS DEAD ITS TRUE
I remember when I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find the first fourth hour and came In crying I was so embarrassed
I can help u up until the last part
I watched every vid except the most recent bc they were the same
I bursted a huge chunk of blood vessels in my neck squatting today lmfao
The issue is I realized I am hot either way so I be slacking
I wish there was a sages on colonization of beans
oh
you still confused?
Wow that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stupid
Sadly I like men too
jen if matt didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist would you date me
i love women but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve unfortunately been in a liking men phase for a while
but i find women more attractive than men ü§ê
Once someone asked me if some days I was fully gay
I was like it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work that way? Like kinda but no?
no ! stay tuned for next week tho
Nobel ain't gon save you
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even say hi smh
i'm all over the place sorry :sadcat3:
because i didn't see you üò≠
She doesn't know what u look like
I just went to Fribley and was yelled at for grabbing a salad
Apparently they're supposed to hand you food
How are you supposed to know that lol
It happened to me once at Leutner too
maybe i've been doing it wrong üòÇ
This was a few months ago when The Roaming Biscuit was at Leutner and then they had some food out there but apparently you weren't supposed to pick it up yourself
@.littlejimmy i still can't do actual squats cuz my back couldn't support the bar
isn't there like a circle bar thing
That ain't for squats tho
Anyone near ksl/tink rn?
Today (or maybe at some point this week? Either way some time after my last speed test) T-Mobile deployed the 5G UC infrastructure in CLE
I feel like I downed a plane with this speedtest lmao
Is that why there were no desserts left at Leutner?
That looks good damn
@ottepotte SHUT THE FUCK UP
I GET TO WRITE ANOTHER FUCKING LINKED LIST WOOHOO

Mont blanc is sick tho
Damn!!!!!!!
Must be a pattern tbh, even though I have a sample size of 3
I wish I can be someone's autistic boyfriend :bob:
I'm pretty poor so all I have is a Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen back home
Were you in class???
I have a new Pelikan m200 that I never had to chance to give to the person I wanted to give it to
It's basically the only brand other than Pilot that you can find without going to "money-no-object" stores
Who did you want to give it to üëÄ
That means us isolation students are gonna get meals delivered instead of needing to go out and be walking exposure risks
That seems counter intuitive
Or us leaving our isolation housing to go to the Den?
Idk man, I've personally double masked (N95 + surgical) and kept welllll clear of other students on the street. I'm 2min away from the Den but still. Others might not be like me tho
Damn what's it like having the common cold variant
Well, it's like a kickass cold, really
It's like what colds feel for people who get colds
Couldn't be me üíÖ
Leaving isolation to get food
Covid won't get u if u r getting food, just like how u don't need to wear a mask of u r eating
I got to class way too early and dr Tran and I are sitting here like üòê
I want to disappear
What class
Luckily everyone is here and my crippling social anxiety just got worse :))))
I'm in that class üëÄ
I can't count
Im in the first row so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go on my phone during class
First row worst row
Is it socially acceptable for a cis man to tuck his hair behind ears
Y'all do work harder for it:crii:

i wanna ask him to scroll up but im scared tehe
<3 no comic sans code tho pls üò≠
AHHH SLOW DOWN

3 days of isolation and i still don't feel remotely covid-y
idk, i dont go enough or care enough to pay money if i can just go for free
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the stamnina
Probably got the common cold variant
tru tho, im just irritated that i can only test out the same day as my math test
Oh, whoops
nope, no symptoms
Last time I checked the common cold had symptoms
Hence why it can't be that
I want to throw up
And feel extremely tired
not gonna hold my breath for that, i've been exposed to 4 ppl in the last week already
Rams are going the beat the absolute shit out of the bengals
@ultimateg I just realized that California has liberals
i need help w/ improper integrals its killing me
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not in 122 but i got a 5 on BC
WTF is an improper integral
I have forgotten all this shit
That needs to become proper
I got a 3 and idk who to blame, def not myself cuz
BC is taught in the same class as AB, and the extra information was taught in the span of abt 1 week and we were told to go over it ourselves
that sucks
@kaori_flute so th√É¬© integral is a whore that needs to be unwhoredw
Oh?
i need more ideas of where to order food from
I lost so much fitness rip
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worked out in months Bc i realized I had to fix my relationship w food
And I literally can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lift the way I used to üò¶
We need a nsfw channel
Am i supposed to just go out there and talk to actual people

I swipe fast, trying to be more careful now
If you don't like them, you are a misogynist ü•∞ü•∞
Ngl I really want chicago style pizza
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be associated w Chicago style pizza
Fuck you
The real reason is that true Chicageans get hella pissed if ur actually from Evanston or some other suburb

whats wrong with pineapple on pizza
im sorry but what's a nutella pizza

Im sorry. we aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t all like that
stow, it's north of akron, close to hudson
Which I hate to say Bc i do Not want to associate w that suburb
Nothing wrong with that
I think you meant to say "So many things wrong with that"
Holy shit
why that so bad lo
LMAO at least it wasn't hand foot mouth
what is hand foot and mouth even?
like I've heard of it but just by the name it seems disgusting
Rip

Miss Fortune

the KSL vending machine won't give me my damn bang
Taking money off ur credit card is the truth
You need to use cash for it it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take anything else
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s how some vending machines here be rip
Oh shit
I just never have cash on me
and i'm trying to fix it
but the closest citibank is 5 miles away
Honestly who uses cash anymore
Reject money
that's the word that i wanted to use

RIP
Man does not stop gaming üò¨
they refuse to close and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally impossible to even go anywhere right now
It's showing up as closed in GrubHub for me
Lol didn't even know they were open
Won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be open until 11
They said yesterday they would open today
The owners are very corrupt and despite multiple workers claiming they literally cannot get to work because of the snow they are still making us come in
Ur joking wtf
One of the main managers said he wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to drive to work tomorrow because of the snow, and instead of giving this overworked man a break (he works 13h a day for 5 days out of the week) they insisted he stay at a hotel nearby
Support your local restaurant owner guys it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard enough that they have to run a business in this weather condition üòî√¢≈ì≈†üèº
@kaori_flute no way u have the same bday as Mendelssohn wtf
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called overpriced shit in case u were curious
honestly case insurance isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too expensive compared to my sister√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s public college üò≠ which has more students who will need to purchase that insurance
Maybe for students it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not bad but employees pay way too much
damn
case insurance is shit tho
This is some r/antiwork shit right here
Worrying about eternal damnation is no where near as fun as worrying that Zeus is gonna fuck your wife
Don't get him horned up like that
He doesn't deserve it
Idk about insurance pricing buttt
Maybe he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll say fuck it and make us take remote classes tho
He did though
university still closed??
I dunno, this email predates Rob's announcement
Er, Rob's request*, sorry
I already have a psych text Wednesday so next week gonna suck

At least it shouldn't be

Honestly I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather get the tests over with since I have to study for psych next week
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m comfy with the content for chem and math so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll take whatever
if i have this weekend to study i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to get more behind in bio
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been studying as I go but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not as caught up for this week cuz priorities

I heard the food at Leutner is horrible today
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s usually horrible, so if people are saying it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse than usual, I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even fathom how disgusting it is lol
They need to bring back the bread pudding
I wish I was joking
W salt and vinegar u need to do it right the lays one tastes like pee
The cream of mushroom soup is healthy though ü•∫
Am i the only person who feels like they will hate whatever they do like any kind of job feels like hell
Like what to do. Die?
I guess but the thought of me having to work even eight hours a day makes me want to die
Like we r supposed to do this for 50 years? Tf?
And earn vacation time? Like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s some weird trophy?
But it shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be
Ill be in the nursing home by then tho
I mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m already working on that
This is just some dumb shit this country is some dumb shit
People have to work hard everywhere
Well i dont want to üò≠
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help you out of this one Jim
Ypu are not lazy, humans arent meant to work for 40h a week everyweek
Hell, even the brits get like 2 weeks paid leave standard
That's not too bad, actually

We scream during labor not when working out
Ive thought about it so much Jen
we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like garrett
Plot twist: I end up in a wheelchair instead
Plot twist: I end up in a wheel chair at 25 due to multiple back injuries, shattered knee caps and herniated discs
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even count them at this point lmfao
I remember watching twelve chairs when I was 10 and it was so funny until the one dude killed his partner in the end Bc he wanted all the money
When does Wyant close again
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t disappoint
Or die trying
No pain no gain

The only thing worse than being alone on Valentine√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Day is being in a long distance relationship on Valentine√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Day
My ex literally broke up w me cuz long distance
She goes to the same college as your boyfriend @pinkfluffyunicorn999
Yes I do sadly. In one rn
Sorry king you deserve better

so we just dont see each other
Bruh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still far esp if you have no transportation
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Spain without the s but at least I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to be obligated to see him when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to be doing homework or professional development
Imagine having someone
shut up ugly smelly stinky stupid looking and short person
Honestly tho not being in a relationship would be ideal rn
I simply could not help but fall for this boy sadly
Never thought something could be a fat W and a fat L at the same time but here we are
Oh no I did not do the test report but I think that would just be what I did in the interactions pane? And I copy pasted that on a doc so I just need to explain now
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m p sure i figured out split but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna go to office hours to confirm. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m rly close either way
Office hours is so fun

Hey I know cwru gives support for students who lost family members and need to take some time off to be reinstated mentally. I was wondering do they do that for losing close friends too or no?
sorry for your loss!
Sorry for your loss :(( @tasfiqurrob
is grubhub not working for anyone else
@alexthedawg bad lmfso
Fuck You Ho
Keep that disgusting shit to yourself
Wtf
How else am I supposed to eat healthy if I need a lunch
NSFW warning (3d modeled but still)
omg
I don't party or nothing I just stay in my room
i dont wanna live off campus though
so unless school will carry it over
oh
Damn
do you still have roommates
in a suite though
i hate roomate
riding upper class students (i.e. sophomores and above. current sophomores are rising upperclassmen
I also want to like
tbh i kind of dont want to move out of my current room. i am living in luxury.
I simply wish to live with like 1 singular person off campus or just by myself off campus
bc i want to live in an apartment by  myself
bc even if i dont get it
i will still get put in a single
ok so yeah i work in the housing office and we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re (rightfully) getting an avalanche of phone calls about the housing stock next year but damn there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s SO MANY CALLLS üò≠üò≠
CWRU be like: Oopsies we let in too many freshman and will do the same next year bye bye upperclassmen ü§™ü§™
this gonna be so shit
This is my serious face :PepeHmmm:
they wont, and they will just force u off next yr
yea, cuz fuck case greed
no way i can afford this shit without my aid
bye bye
honestly i know just as much as u do my bosses dont say shit
R u clean
I don't
i have a class in glennan
for math
Will u be getting a car
Do I really wanna drive in Cleveland
no chance of getting stuck in clarke
dont cheer, if case gets away with this, they are going to further lean in to the over admitting
no wonder case isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t letting me add classes to my schedule last semester, they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do basic counting to see if they have enough housing
oh they know they dont have enough housing, they just dont care as they are completely isolated from students
who wants to bunk in Spartan rehearsal hall with me next year
dont joke, they would 100% attempt to do that w/ the top of the hill ones
i mean bc honestly what is another solution
Building more housing ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cheap
nope
if case wanted to, they could
but they dont
Damn
I thought it would approach half of it
I mean, building new housing would probably require tuition increases because they can't just take from the endowment willy-nilly
if u apply for studio and u dont get one
they dont let u participate in other lotteries
also which srv buldings are the best i forgot
They r all bad
generally tippit but tippit is still ugly
i just want a kitchen in suite
but i dont get to choose if i dont get studio
Half of total assets are long term investments and I think houses are at least half of it
didnt u get to participate in other lotteries before
i am fr going to transfer if i get to junior year and they pull some shit like this
also might even need to trasnfer next year bc its so expensive
the only reason i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not applying to transfer rn is because the application to the school id apply to is due in 3 weeks
I mean, completely hypothetically, let's just say that I left the fire escape door of Noble apartment 7A unlocked and I am able to just squat any time I want
Taking a nap in college is deadly as fuck
No but seriously
ik wisdom teeth pokes through your gum cuz my bottom 2 came out already
when it happened to me I just kinda ripped off the flap
damn ok
This shit kinda big idk how long it's gonna take for me
shit's annoying asf doe
H2O2 that shit if it hurt
I am really confused.
Den alex u stupid bitch
fuck you bitch how is chem 145
Tbh the missing 2nd person plural from most American English dialects is just kinda weird
I don't think "u gyz" is popularized until relatively recent yrs
Sorry there r, no conjugations is where it's at
I realized how useful it was
what the fuck
CWRU does shit on Second Life
wtf
god, I thought the shit about CWRU students being complete nerds, unable to integrate into society was a joke.
Dawg I had so many errors in my Chem lab today I wanted to kms
@rsgsockcheck dont worry they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give a fuck
ya they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re dumb and they want money actually
Can someone summarize
cwru is trying to grow the undergraduate population and in doing so will not reliably be able to accommodate upperclassmen students (rising juniors and seniors)
yea, cuz when I dont get case housing, I then have to: Find an apartment, furnish it, pay for heating, water, electricity, any maintenance, food, laundry, etc
B-b-but Case needs their revenue :pissedfren:
If you don't shut the fuck up right fucking now
Why do people want to live in uni housing? Shit sucks and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more expensive. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure the total cost of an apartment + util + food is less than what case is charging rn
people have financial aid that will get taken away if they do not live on campus
If you rely on grants or financial aid to pay for school, a minimum of 11k (I think) is deducted from that if you move off campus, and that is extremely detrimental to someone like me who cannot otherwise afford college.
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I understood that was a minimum, my b lol
I mean why can't they guarantee housing for people under financial aid
But wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you be saving money by moving off campus so net debt would be similar or the same? Or is the deduction also from tuition?
No you would not be saving money
Cuz they didn't have to guarantee housing for them
They could do this but, again, they don't care
they dont want to do that, they want to keep people who are paying full prices
Idk if they r expecting some resistance
they aint, they have room
they claim its due to "lack of space"
case owns a FUCK ton of land and buildings
like, its scary
oh
Yea but when u r bureaucratic enough like any college, it's extremely difficult to go abt any decisions with using land or money
im lazy as shit so i dont go to euclid
I mean I understand why they accept more people than they can take in but I don't understand why they messed up the estimation so badly
imagine being close to euclid :LAUGHING:
they didnt "mess up" this was planned
yeah im in raymond so its like 5 mins
but why walk there when i can sit and do nothing üòå
i mean i dont live near the main part of campus euclid but ya
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s def not that simple tho
Idk why 2021 isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t out yet
if anyone wants to read it
dont you mean internal != public
If internal doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t match public
no it doesnt
hasnt stopped them before
unfortunately lol
thats sad
because Case is paying me to live there and I can't afford *not* to
and if they don't pay me to live there I'll have to squat in Tink
Living in tink doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sound too bad tbh
Sorry if I offended anyone
@denoris my knee jerk reaction was to say the same thing Bc Im a commuter and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to apply for aid. You just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know better and also did not anticipate the fin aid system to be this fucked up
Because what the fuck
If nothing is done now, the only change will be for the worse
we are currently at a place where this change is being introduced, if it is not fought now, it will become the standard, and become worse yr after yr
I get it doesnt effect ya rn, but it will very soon
imma just sleep in Tink my junior year
step sis, help me im stuck
This is ridiculous. I get that it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t impact me personally but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like seeing people who are impacted by this distressed
fuck the ü•¨
housing agenda: "get the fuck off my property" -CWRU
I've noticed the change.org ones never do anything, ever
we need to hold a riot
Bc they act like they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all enlightened and liberal and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be seen as racist even tho they lowkey are
fuck him
I think thats what turned the frogs gay
its not to the school
u didnt see that
in which various, clever implication should that be taken in
Yeah but you can't live on campus there either
idk
yeah i mean after next year im seriously considering it
osu! has a very toxic community tho
ya if they dont solve this problem i am not taking the chance of not getting on campus housing and getting my aid cut in half
if anyone wants to spam their emails
i can
after my chem exam
if they dont write a story about it i will be sad
they prolly won't even read it :NM_PeepoLaugh:

Eric Brewer√¢‚Ç¨Àús house wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t what I was expecting tbh
Apparently he was the mayor of East Cleveland
Son of mechanical engineer and english teacher, originally Macedonian, illegally emigrated to the US because his passport says he was born in 2000, non-white yet pretends he is white, Case-attending foreign spy Andrej Antunovikj
It sure doesn't see race
point taken
andrej you may need to find alternative sources of income if they keep this housing policy so
I'd suggest learning how to draw a bored ape
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care who the IRS sends I am NOT paying my taxes
R u saying u do NOT wish to financially support our glorious wars for democracy?
Ik someone who legit believe wind turbines run on gas when there's no wind

seems racially motivated tbh
i want recognition for my contributions to the cause
Worse
nah my prof said they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything

Man Keler must be adjusting to the new work environment ngl

I mean we've never interacted before so I can only assume
Wtf literally defamation
yall should i tell them i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be anonymous
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure the people who write the observer articles aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t anonymous
Ope, point taken
WTF ARE THE LAKERS DOING
Damn
I got the gist of it when I tried to read it
I'm glad I learned Cyrillic, tho I still don't know many words in Russian
@.littlejimmy i want to hear abt the 2026 kids

No bc I literally will feel bad:FeelsDadMan:
No offense but literally some of the ppl they admitted this year and last year should not b at case
Sad
so? they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re being rude. they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deserve your time
:FeelsDadMan: ik but still
look if u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wanna be rude just say you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know the answer to the next few questions they ask
Unfortunately
unfortunately the decision is still up to administration
Maybe they won't use the footage
i didnt even think to remind her
also no way they get mad at me
that would look so bad on their part
imagine i go back to the news channel
"you'll never guess what fucking happened Aria"
yeah *no shit*
so maybe i want them to come after me
I think Eric Karebear is looking at an early retirement only 6 months into his career but that could just be me
Fair point
This your TA speaking, please pay attention in class üôÇ

i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think i could be more bored in schmitt auditorium than i am in biol 215
I hope you never take CSDS338 with Ronald Loui.
i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gone now you are now allowed to start partying ig
i think they call that "poor teaching"
...but he doesn't explain anything unless asked
So, yeah, we cycle back to "poor teaching"
im boutta fall asleep in 233 rn
Whenever I feel bored in 233 I pretend the prof is just an AI that developed sentience and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just playing the role of a professor to hide from Zuckerberg who wants to integrate him into the metaverse and that makes lecture a little better
damn i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
did i miss it
i dont think so
omg
It happened!
We just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know it
hey Kaler fuck you
Oh

Bro can youtube stop giving me fucking covid vaccine ads holy shit unskippable and 10 seconds each
As "pro-vax" as I am, the vax ads r so cringe I'm starting to think it's propaganda
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just trying to get the dumb republicans on board
Idk how to get through to stupid people
I legitimately cannot deal w people some of whom are stupid day in Day out
you don't
I rlly wanna know did Biden actually shit himself üíÄ
omg alex
And then shit just keeps getting stolen
he'll steal your money, and your meal swipes
Maybe something similar would work with vaccines
i'm just saying this wasnt an issue last yr :P
due to staffing issues
dats y they wont do that
yes, and i'm tired of saying its not
well, we probably want to watch the weather
at the end of the day its all about the money
we make their pockets hurt and theyll change
simple really
There's a jolly order someone's last name is Escobar. Is it common cuz I only know 1 person with that last name

Anyone wanna go on an early valentine's day Chilli's date?
1) I'm bi
2) Valentine's Day dates don't need to be romantic
3) ratio

Motherfuckers literally made me lost progress because I spelled an element the British way instead of the American way

~~me arriving late is a me problem though~~
nothing beans on toast "people" do is correct

Fucking based
I miss being in Turkey and preparing and eating it üò¶
Could someone look at my SAGES paper and critique it by any chance? If not, I completely understand.
Someone help him out
And the ones I go to I'm late
and dont show up
I got a prof last year who was a notoriously hard grader but I did fine. The writing center helped a lot
Shit
same with mine but he didnt grade harsh
It can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be as bad as physics or some crap
Idk I think it was average
Granted my last semester was really rough for personal and medical reasons so maybe she went a bit easier on me
I almost bombed my midterms Bc I was sick and had a family situation
Until I fail harolds class
did u take it last sem
No i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t no
idk
i think its half half and u have to consider covid situations these past few semesters so
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true daddy drew was awful over zoom for example
I'm taking CHEM111 with him rn and I never took AP Chem, and I'm actually understanding what's going on in class
I don't lol
The aleks was wack that was the only thing I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like
i wanna do engineering i havent declared but im thinking mech e
Oh yah
i cant find my old stuff üò≠
i think i threw shit away from how annoyed i was
Oh
I still have my exams but they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re 105
Just praying I do not fail csds 132
thermodynamics is where everthing went wrong for me
and didnt understand shit

But carry on we need doctors
That's like saying it sucks but it's good
I wanted to be a hospice doc
yes it sucks
ppl glamorize it but its not all that lol the field needs to be for u
i dont think engineering gonna help
And gpa doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter as kuch
I feel like engineering, specifically BME, is significantly harder than pre-med
No Bc it rly is. My dad is a mechanical engineer by training and he got into BME when it was hot
I know so many ppl who got into the field and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even get a degree in it
I love chemistry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sad I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make it a career
Chemical engineering isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rly that much chemistry in practic
Most ppl don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand that
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe in that stuff
Like if I need chemo I need chemo but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather treat my issues naturally
fuck you ho
OMG YUSEF
Stfu don't even speak
I mean it's free, didn't say u can't feed it to ur cat

Crying and throwing up how do I explain to my mother that these joggers from lulu lemon are made from the same material as my scrubs from Walmart
Tell her that she simply isn't a √¢≈ì¬® material gworlüíÖüèº
She called a perfectly normal model fat and I got triggered Bc that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the attitude that literally gave me an eating disorder so I cried and left
Fuck lulu lemon
fuck lulu lemon
I'm sorry that's so fucked
This is why I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m always on campus and never at home üôÉüôÉüôÉ

Thou shalt not be a fucking dumb racist hypocritical bitch
@toomanyzs that sucks man
Tell Joey b and his crew to pack their shit and vacate SoFi
that sucks man
I miss my boyfriend
I miss my ex üòê
But like also I hate her
Honestly being in an ldr on Valentine√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Day is kinda worse than being single at least imo
She didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem like a gem of a person so just try to focus on the good which is the fact that she isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wasting ur time anymore
FUCKING
No Bc honestly I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been staying off ig because all the couple pictures make me cry. I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wish this on anyone, especially if the other person isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t 100% in with the relationship as well
Rly and truly relationships suck anyways
Oh holy fuck that's even worse...
Protip: if the person isn't committed and doesn't even remotely wanna discuss the issues
I've seen it happen
see i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gotten to the point of actually going on dates because whenever someone talks to me i just ignore them because i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared

Computers do all the math in engineering anyway
Java doesn't give a fuck

i think theres something wrong w my class path
im sleep
I think there is something wrong w everything I am doing on this project
rip
Bestie are u stuck on split
i cant call any methods
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call one of my methods and idk why
Are u missing a bracket?
I swear it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not my syntax I think Java just hates me
My string isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t concatenating properly
Rip
this means ur class path is fucked and u need to see dr connamacher yesterday to fix it
he'll be able to do it he managed to make JUnit work on my janky M1 mac

EITHER DRIVE PAST IT OR DON'T EVEN TURN INTO THE GOD DAMN STREET
Now I'm mega late for class as opposed to 1-2min late

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m filing a missing item report with the police just in case
Thoughts on no longer needing masks in res halls?
except if ur immunocompromised thenit's not pog at all
kind of scared because i have asthma
not exactly immunocompromised but scary
happy because this is an improvement towards normalcy but i dont want it to like get bad again bc of it
From tmrw u won't get covid in dorms
Is it normal that I had an Amazon package delivered a whole week ago and Wade still hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t summoned me to go get it
You can go in and find it yourself
Also if u spot ur package outside the counter, just bring it to them. They'll be kinda pissed but they'll let u have it
one time I pointed out a box behind them that was obviously my piano stand and they still didn't let me have it
oddly satisfying yet triggering
Why are they pissed when it saves them work
U r "disrupting" their work
Hence why it's shit
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s some smelly shit that ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even garbage that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s poop
Idk how people listen to it all the time :cursed_flushed:
@kaori_flute Licherally late for a midterm
Bad student smh
@kaori_flute missed the macro exam smh:PU_PeepoSMH:

To go or not to go to class today
I literally will not b able to find parking
I can afford to lose some clicker points

Me too I haven't gone to physics in a week
YES YOU ARE NOT ALONE
i've missed most of my lectures this semester
Do the HW, take the exam
but that doesn't work for everyone üò≠
i will say one thing about coding i like is it makes me feel big brain when someone asks what a code means
Being aware that you don't know some things is a sign that your knowledge is legitimate
If you think you know everything... you don't know the half of it
If someone says "that's cap" in the context that Wes did, it means that they disagree with you
Don't you have a binary tree to do or sumn
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you have sigma bonds or smth ???
Idk but I see a lot of shit together in that bin
Are you still at Wyant
No i just left
And I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cry and throw up
But back when I had an eating disorder stuff like that would trigger me so much even tho rationally I knew it was way off
I was like DAMN YOU THINK IM THICC???
Or you could just get someone to hug you Oscar
I find it really astonishing how most Americans couldn't differentiate between "Liberal" and "neoliberal"
I forgot that men don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hug each other Bc hugging is for women only
*straight* men don't :fingerguns:
I do ~~I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t receive~~
Please stop with the iFunny memes I'm begging you
No need to apologize
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m too tired to hang out tn
I have to wake up early tomorrow, so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m probably going to sleep now instead

Just listen to heavy metal and scream and cry Bc what else is there to do
I like the one on the left
Do you just slap their head instead?
Idk why women are stereotyped as always training legs I hate training legs

Southside Case Police office
I legit do not know what else to do my lab is due soon and I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it open
Omg I was in that area a bit ago
And you will find it
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any other my apps open
And close all the other instances
I should be sleeping now. I will be able to wake up tomorrow, with plenty of sleep under my belt and ready to be productive. That is the optimal course of action.
I have to go to bed at 1 AM after that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m too tired to understand anything so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s useless staying up
It keeps u running into the night but not too late
God damn it the rain stopped and now I actually gotta go to class
Mtn dew doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even have that much caffeine I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think
Or am i totally wrong
It makes me feel sick I mixed it w alcohol too many times
I literally cannot drink alcohol anymore
And so I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink it without feeling rly nauseous
I legitimately can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so bad that some of my relatives just disappeared one day
They probably blacked out and died in a ditch
And in Russia they drink perfume or rubbing alcohol literally anything that has alcohol if their alcoholism is in its last stage Bc they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so desperate for a fix
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s legitimately torn apart my family I rly hope my kids don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get my tendency to drink. I really couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t control myself around it and still can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Alcohol abuse is no joke. I feel like it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talked about as much as it should be in the US
So they can sell weapons n shit
I hate him the gas cannot become more expensive
World war 3 isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gonna happen I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think Putin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s profile so far as his mental illnesses go are different from hitlers
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not gonna say it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happen but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unlikely
The us is so problematic like why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t my mom move to Canada
Pros: she would have never met my dad, no USA
Cons: poor
Side note I am fucking pushing p
My little shit brain couldn't comprehend when my elementary school teacher said "u can't clap with one hand", what complete bullshit I said
As a response when someone is messing with me
god doesn't need to save her - she's been around since the dinosaurs and can live through anything
Dinosaurs don't exist
At this point I legit could go behind the theory that she died last yr lmao
WE WILL SEE HER NEVER
Legit laughed when someone said the palace is getting Giger-isque
Holy shit
I rly need meds
And I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even get paperwork for accomodations
U need a psychiatrist to prescribe u
Yeah I know but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to one until I have the paperwork
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m already diagnosed I just need te paper work I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go through the cognitive tests again
Wtf
I keep calling the practice and she won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick up
They never gave it to u?
No they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Wtf
I hate it here
Sue them Holy shit
Wtf
It gets pretty bad for me some time lol
Lmao some time I almost tried to randomly call someone in my contacts
But I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t smoke weed now so I use cbd oil sometimes
a lot of things said within the last 10 minutes shouldn't be discussed here
i didn't say i'm against that
I ain't doing anything with thc in it lmao
If you vaporize it idk it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably a placebo but it helps. Cbd won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up on drug tests
Yeah but I passed mine üòé
Just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take meds
I'll stop a week before my next med exam
Which won't happen in prob 2 yrs
No you need more than a week
I'm making it sound like I'm taking some illegal shit lmao
Why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t u tell them
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to take meds
Bc I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t eat
Holy shit
Caffeine bad
What do you want him to do?
I want him to declare war
instead of russia annexing ukraine i want biden to annex ukraine
I want Biden to Annex Canada, if Russia annexes ukraine.
Idk what will happen to it but it won't be the same
I cannot think abt how bad things are
tbf, everything has been shit, always
probably since the dawn of man
and you are still here √¢¬§√Ø¬∏
Having someone so pro-establishment in charge, he'll further accelerate the condition
In contrast to someone more right wing and nationalist in charge, and shrink the US to a regional power
But wtf do i know
So yea I don't think the US will disintegrate
Fucking hilarious
It's like that guy who turned himself into a pickle
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell if the pit in my stomach is from coffee or existential dread
The queen died üòÄ
Omg @kaori_flute actually not late to econ
Why can't Case be like this ü•∫
What are your spring break plans folks
death by jolly scholar
Idk @Deleted User
yousef hates burgers
I can feel a very large vein in my forearm
it feels very large
prolly fine until it hurts or looks weird
Caffeine can kill u
But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never do coke
If it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come from the earth dont use it
It made me want to puke idk why
it also doesnt involve killing animals and uses like 100x less water
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even do forearm stuff and my forearm has more veins than anywhere else
I got bored of it so fast @denoris
And whenever I get bored of food it makes me want to throw up eating it
you would die in medieval Europe so fast
I ate a 1-2 burgers every day for the entirety of the fall semester
yeah ur fucked in medevial europe they ate fucking flour mixed with water no yeast or other levening
you could literally build a house out of that shit it's so hard
Damn y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all picky asf
no bro i dont think you understand what the result of baking flour and water mixed together is
Discord is nothing but unproductive
Nah Max being a typical incel scared them away
I hate Miami
Fuck Miami
you don't have to snort it and damage your nose or smoke it and damage your lungs
fuck miami
Miami sucks ass
Miami hate page
I have a friend who is a communist and I want to hit him in the head w a book
Like does he want to starve
Like my mom grew up in Soviet russia does he want holes in the ground as restrooms?
Does he want to go to school and poop next to other children
I don't have to flush
Bro im from India we just shit in the streets
Fuk is all this hole shit yall talkin bout
I went to Turkey once as a small child and they only had an alaturk and I peed in my pants Bc I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to pee on the alaturk
My relatives were crying and throwing up
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have friends
Idk what changed
I mastered that cuz like at schools we didn't have toilets
it's nice that my bare ass isn't touching any surface another person's bare ass just touched though
I just was afraid as a kid to pee in them Bc I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t aim Bc I was not a man
Bc my friend wants to poop in a hole in the ground
who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tbf
Do u want cooked cockroaches
fucking
My mom said that in university she was so poor that she basically had two slices of bread and jam to eat the last year of her college
And she would like pass out and faint and have nothing to eat half the time
They defeated the nazis tho
Like do u want to live in a grey apartment complex full of alcoholic men?
Once one of her friends dads ran outside naked saying Satan was chasing him Bc he was withdrawing from alcohol and hallucinating
My grandad worked in a coal mine till he died from lung cancer which he got from working in the coal mine
And pls don't tell me u prefer the suburb culture here
mans died before my mom met my dad
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so sad tho üò¶
actually I'm not even sure when he died
That was my grandpa w alcohol except one night my grandma beat him up so bad he never drank again
Nooo that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sad so you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never met him?
ngl I could've prolly used his discipline in my earlier days
How old was he when he died?
I don't even know probably in the 40's or 50's
My grandparents were scientists during the cultural revolution, my dad got shot in tiananmen
That's also why he never finished college
Idk why the west acts like Tiananmen was the way they think it was
tankman licherally talked with the dude in the tank and just left
But obv shot still fired üî•
FBI tried having him spy for them, he refused, they put the guy in prison with no conviction and deported him last yr
Imagine if this happened in China lmao, it's gon be headline for a month straight
God forbid another country does anything wrong
I don't think our school even made any official statements abt this
No they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
I guess they were never asked to make one so
This happened when he's was in charge I think so it makes sense
They can get anyone they want into trouble
I'm legit from the wrong country studying the wrong major
Everyone wants a piece of this ass üòé
Yeah even my mom gets searched Bc she took my dads last name
Turkey isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even associated w much terrorism aside from the Kurds
My programming project got graded and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the last good grade I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ever gonna get in my entire college career
Bruh gtfo Miami is the worst part of Florida
seems like an entertaining place
florida is the worst part of florida
I respectfully appreciate your opinion. Unfortunately, it would appear as though your mother is gay.
oscar boutta be like tiananmen didn't happen
Oh i know damn well it happened
I mean, generally yes? I wouldn't say I'm an expert on it but I know it was an extended student protest for democracy and freedom of speech/press that was violently broken up
Cuz we both from Beijing
There's a reason we don't chime in when y'all talk abt it, absolutely not cuz we don't know abt it
Lmao I just realized u also drank lmaoo
I'm sure he didn't mean it, I mean even within the government and military there's been a lot of back lash
The open fire part is cuz only the military was involved, cuz China didn't have experience in riot control at the time
But when the tanks arrived the next morning most students were already gone
Cuz tanks literally were based in somewhere like 2hrs drive from the city
And they r slow lmao
This moment tho was still under a lot of debate by politics enthusiasts like any old folk in Beijing lmao
not nearly the same scale tho
So the soldiers are supposed to just die? üíÄ
And most Americans surprisingly don't know abt it
that one is so fucked holy shit
I think it's important to know that tiananmen happened under the wave of so-called peaceful revolution across Eastern Europe
They r quite concerned with that could potentially have happened
i honestly cant tell if oscar is trolling
The biggest lie is prob that the Chinese don't know abt it
So just don't be surprised when they have very different view on things
And the average Chinese person don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give a shit
And I think the average middle and working class Chinese is smart and rational, it takes real change to make them patriotic as they r rn lol. The Americans tend to believe it's some sort of Chinese propaganda conditioning etc, but if anything that China after mao is bad at looool
China is ran by engineers, and the US is ran by lawyers
Holy shit that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s accurate as fuck üíÄ
The power dynamics they tried to build
Because we have a lot of people studying policy
But all of that work gets tossed out the window because half the country is completely out of this world irrational
and our government setup is antiquated and shit
so nothing gets done ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏
But so some of the problems r
1 is the legal system is still not complete
But maybe cuz of the culture, or the gov, even tho protests do happen, there just isn't a culture of political involvement for the average people
Considering our history I wouldn't blame this all on the current govv
Gee I'm not drunk but I fucking wish I am rn
I can't consciously do that shit
So anyways, pretty complicated topic, I typically don't type political shit, ask me in person
The doc is switching me to dexaphetamine but I read it could be worse
Rough in the afternoon, but absolutely fucking killing it in the morning
Damn
Damn bruh
Damn u be in NY over the summer?
Oh nicee
Fuck California xd
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m am/ was a relatively fit person and the last time I visited I would get winded climbing up stairs that I would never struggle climbing in Cleveland
The air Is horrible
the air is still cleaner than la though lmao
where tf do you live cuz me too
I would not be upset if I died having never visited LA
Nyc tho I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad I visited I just couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live there
in fucking westchester county
idk whose idea that was
isn't it just Chester
oh no
Anyone have a Saturday morning flight (March 5th) and wants to join our Uber group, we'll cut costs by amount of ppl, plan is for 3-4ish AM
like bro maybe my auntie dead and my moms sleeping I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
I'm so sorry, let us know if we can help in any way, I'm always up for food if you need someone to talk to
No fuck this shit frl. Like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m ethnically russian but my entire family and home is in Ukraine so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m kinda sad
yeah i watched the presidents speech a couple hours ago, super sad
Damn Russia actually invaded
and dont live it
won't do us much good I guess
M√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢y relatives said their windows are broken
Fuck
I was hoping they were gonna stick to non-civilian targets
But then again I'm... insane for even remotely hoping that
I want them to just leave
They can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just leave everything
They r all the same but they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re fucking not
The point stands, the world has been doing far too little to stop Russia from being a threat to its surrounding countries considering what happened last time, but we should be ashamed that we need a bot account to say this
Like, why do we need to hear it from "lilycatsmeow"
Instead of someone more influential
The US been sending weapons to Ukraine for months even when both sides were trying to find diplomatic solutions
And idk why they be surprised of how things have went
Were they trying to find diplomatic solutions, though? Can you even find a diplomatic solution with Russia?
Im Just scared for my people. I thought Putin would have some humanity, there are lots of Russians who now live in Ukraine like my relatives. Not a single person in my family is a citizen of Russia except for my grandma. But no
If they really tried ofc they can
There is no diplomatic solution. The US fucked up w Russia during world war 2 and now we have problems we can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t solve
Yea but they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the baggage that they do now
Im so upset rn
I literally want to just take the day off but I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Nato is fucking useless
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like a rly bad therapist
But anyways, I damn sure the US gets involved again like old times, for a reason I previously explained
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m rly fucking pressed it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so bad that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going to the subway
NATO didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t brainlessly push its eastwards expansions
NATO wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t so fucking useless
NATO reminds me of my last therapist when I told him I was anxious he told me to just breathe
My last therapist said that suicide was a door that I could "look at, but not open"
Oh but it was a female
Her name isn't John
All my therapist have been women tho
This is not the worst one
Damn this Ishmail Palpatine conflict really hits different these days ahaha
Never skip brain day
Im supposed to focus on my silly midterms!
Zelenskyy said Putin ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t picking up his phOne üíÄüíÄüíÄ

Vladdy stop! This isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t You!
Western media stirring shit up again lmao
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna happen now
Does the UN sacrifice Ukraine so WWIII doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t break out
Sorry, make more money
I DON'T HAVE 35K
I don't have college savings üò©
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need 35k
This ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stocks crypto is a lot more lenient
I sold my pants shirts underwear testbooks car insurance jewelry iPhone laptop kidney + testicles for bitcoin
dang i hope ur cs hw does itself without a laptop
Zelenskyy left Ukraine üíÄ
Fuck him and fuck every leader in that part of the world
what a stupid question
I already lost so much money on eth
I invested like 2 months ago
Sorry, not all-time
From the internet
Crying and throwing up
I hate circuits
I hate
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not bad it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just not my thing
Should have taken 131b
No isnt that even more circuits and less coding?
No It is actually bad I respect engineers sm for doing stuff like that
I could never
Le √¢‚Ç¨≈ìboth sides bad?√¢‚Ç¨
Abt how all American alies r weak, America's enemies r bad, and only America can save the world
I want to fight some ppl here frl
America needs to be that country but we never are
I don't think the US is even capable
America needs to mind its own damn business for once because it clearly hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been fucking able to the last 100 years and screwed so much shit up
Since that was never the point
We are capable in an absolute sense, but our government is so shit that our resources are wasted
Gee I really wanna do my political experiment
Isolationism definitely isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the solution though
I've literally never seen a country
TRUE America needs to allow Russia to invade a sovereign country and ally without resistance because Putin needs to defend himself
Corporations + the rich have a huge amount of influence which they shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, but calling america an oligarchy is a huge oversimplification and incorrect
Where most people in charge shamelessly dedicate most of their time in office to fund raising, the power of lobbying
It's not even influence anymore
Gee I can't spell today
I mean in a certain sense it's not that bad, it's a very efficient machine
Im not talking about the case with Ukraine i am talking about things in general. We have meddled so much in the past and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired of it. This is the result. And our leader is too incompetent to fix anything. Regardless of what we do it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a lose lose situation for Ukraine
Money doesn't even just influence politics here
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think anyone understands that either way Ukraine is fucked regardless of what we do. And I honestly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know the answer here.
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think Biden is even cognitively capable of leading the US or any country
Im tired and sick of all the show that the US is making out if this as opposed to trying to do something that actually helps. So you know what, the US can fuck off and not do anything at all. Because they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve done enough fucking damage already
Wtf did Biden do here lmao
Idk
He did nothing. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the problem. So the US as a whole might as well continue doing nothing since clearly that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the stance we have taken
What do you want him to do
Something or nothing?
The Biden dementia meme never fails to piss me off
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s anything that the US as a whole could do but I would like to have seen more investment into foreign aid for Ukraine in the past and more support as a country not just through the United Nations for the refugee situation that is about to explode potentially
I also wish that they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make such a public show out of it. I felt that they were trying to just make themselves look good the past few weeks.
If you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything then don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sit there and participate in a useless circle jerk
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t capitalize on the grief and fear of an entire nation maybe?
Literally dont go to the lectures
You dont need to
Legit hearing libs say "if it's not us who's gonna help these poor countries" is like the nazis saying "if it's not us who's gonna liberate Europe from Jewish bolshevism"
Scary actually
Wdym when it already happened bro
Clean version
The UK said they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re launching cyber attacks on Russian
Apparently America asked China to try to convince Russia to take a step back?üíÄ
If he did that none of this would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve happened
Mainly what Russia wanted was if they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get Ukraine to side with them, make sure Ukraine is neutral (not NATO/west leaning)
Also I don't think Ukraine gets to he neutral between NATO and Russia
NATO pushed their luck with Russia and Ukraine ended up being the scapegoat
And now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s either sacrifice Ukraine or go full blown WWIII
Holy shit how is the world this fucked
cuz the US is the biggest head of NATO üíÄ
Point is innocent people are suffering because some old folks are mad at each other
The plethora of sequelae is gonna push the world to WWIII eventually if this doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t escalate to WWIII
What in the fuckity fuck
@.littlejimmy they fell asleep in the subway
Bc their house is damaged and they are still fighting
this is so funny China rly just wants nothing to do w this
We just want Taiwan back from the traitors üòà
The Russian military probably wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go out of their ways to hurt civilians but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still a war zone after all
@.littlejimmy it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too late to get out. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re worried they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get hurt if they get out of the shelter
Bc theres still active conflict there
Me too Bc wtf
Wish the media would show the anti war protest in Russia cuz shit is massive
:FeelsWeirdMan: wtf
if russia invaded a NATO country tho
the last thing the world wants or needs is US and Russian troops firing at each other
over a country that isn't even in nato
Nothing is impossible üíÄ
There's a non 0 chance we get hit by an extinction level astroid at any given min

According to a researcher at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be at the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole.

Aren't we allüò≠
One day I will lose my mind Bc i am beyond mentally ill so i am determined to also not end up in a Wheelchair
MSG makes rice bowls better, but they're tasty without it too
No ones shaming it it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just impossible to keep doing the same thing w someone for years and years. I just couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even feel like I want kids
Sometimes I see kids and I get baby fever but most of the time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m neutral to them
Im Just Not ready yet i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think
I hate kids
until i checked the site that says there's 7 rooms available
And she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t call you a slur?? ü§Ø
We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re also trying for STJ
how would the backup work
isnt group selection before individual
oh
i have this internal sense that i will ultimately end up in a random suite in michelson or something idk
This book makes me cringe so hard and unironically hate the working class
Is this what management class does
oscar hates the poor
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t with this shit
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand people with this mentality
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Sometimes when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re in deep deep shit you start to believe you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t deserve better
Idk how
Is work
Find the exact same job again
U know Im rly mad. When men have a nip slip at the gym no one bats an eye but if a woman√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s boob falls out it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the end of the world
Like why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t women walk around w their tits out Im so mad
I hate society
I wish I could
If Minoan women could walk around w their tits out why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I? Yes. Because of patriarchy that sexualizes women√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bodies
Egalitarian and matriarchal cultures didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t give a fuck
Sometimes I get sad that men don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have boobs
if you work out, or don't work out enough
wow this certainly reflects on all poor people and should inform our policy choices
He was offered education and willingly turned his back from it
They want all your information to sell to China

jolly having me work full time over spring break ü§™
i work 6 hours 6 days in a row with no day off
Thats üí∞ tho
yeah but i need to study
and a paper due on the friday
nearly half of the money im legally allowed to make this semester
But you literally do nothing for 90% of the time
Unfortunately that one person is always me
imagine working when you could be making bank buying and selling NFTs without even having to step outside your room @_s.k @eekhannah :clowning:  
#SigmaGrindSet #Crypto #NFT
I don't think they all died tho
@_s.k how many hours do they schedule u per week
No she didn't make any money
Wtf there's a second?
But i dropped a 2hr shift because of a class
the demon core is our real life scp, and a look into why scientists are stupid
Imagine dying because a screwdriver fell and almost caused a supercritical mass
Look up √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpenis stuck in pencil sharpener√¢‚Ç¨
my boss emailing me to ask how many hours i want over break while i was working my scheduled shift at her restaurant then scheduling me for 36 before i could reply
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìmost want 20-30, we can go up to 40, but we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t√¢‚Ç¨
Oh fuck oh shit
except I have to deal with students that think saferide is their personal chauffeur service
i have tinnitus tho
Im screaming and crying
My boyfriend doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know who the killers are
Idec anymore
Nah Thats nothing
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like permanent for me tho üòù
Oh yeaaah
Every day I hug my fucking squid to sleep
Idk it just sucks how we are long distance and sometimes I wonder what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing this for
Probably only for us to break up when I finish school because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get a job somewhere he won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think he is using it ironically
Never
I hug my waifu bodypillow to sleep too
you said you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have pink!
r u jealous @.littlejimmy
damn
I just need a big tiddy goth gf
I think that scared her off:NM_PeepoLaugh:

Fish are stupid fuck fish

Me when I first thought lifting will help me be popular but I just end up developing severe body dysmorphia and injury my self
Every time I see my bf I get stressed Bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m worried he won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like me anymore Bc i gained weight or some other stupid shit
||But the female dolphins produce aphrodisiac so strong it can kill someone||
I wish I could b smart like them
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be a dolphin
I want to be an octopus
I want to be an anomalocaris
But only during their prime tho
i mean, it *is* a collective chauffeur service
But I've sold a lot of stuff
my laptop has more RAM that it has storage
literally couldn't even run windows
If it's who I think it is (the girl that called me on the phone and kept praising me) all I did was that I put her in a car that already had 2 people in it
The saferide system doesn't put more than 2 people in every car unless I make it
Whenever I work shifts, the ETA goes down by 20 minutes. I'm not the smartest person on the planet, the system is just shit and buggy af and makes drivers go in circles
Either way it warms my little heart that someone cares about me :)
This ain't it Ukraine
Sorry for going off on u buddy but I'm pissed off about taxes üò≠
Im sorry
only the working class should be evading tax
If they do I argue it's morally necessary to hurt it
Only the working class should be *paying* tax*
Wtf
"who needs they ussy taken" "omg me"
It didnt age well
what she called you prolly doesnt match to the sheer power of Serbia

Crying and throwing up I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to b working
Amazon just sent me a test after I applied for APP like two months ago
I applied for that too abt a month ago, haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t heard back abt it yet.
Some bitches god damn
This is some ancapistan shit lmao
This person needs a lil car jacking
Standing near the top of Ancapistan's hierarchy, a powerful private police force doesn't sound so bad anymore
when case is confronted with the issue of crime on campus, they choose the "police the shit out of it" option over the "fix the underlying issue" option
I mean, you can't "fix" crime... Definitely not by policing the shit out of it, but also very likely not by other methods, too
you can absolutely reduce it by undoing the decades of policy that causes concentration of poverty, poor education, and lack of opportunity which are empirically the primary drivers of crime
Case is an institution that has a lot of power and leverage in local government,  they cant make the necessary changes by themselves but they can do other things
How well is it going to go with parents and alumni if they say "crime is bad right now so we're gonna try doing community outreach instead of boosting policing budget". I'm not commenting myself on the effectiveness of any particular strategy but increasing policing is likely to be the most popular
I shit you not this is what I got for the word today
pls dont misgender me
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m bout to be super late üòÇ
idk im not in this class i followed jen here
My bad
Midterm exam

Dude I watched the video of Russian undertakers maintaining Lenin's preserved body (it's been dead for a good chunk of time, so you can imagine how much of him is left that isn't rotten) and it looked more alive than this mf did when he was still walking
Jolly on order 75 already and im still waiting for my order 30 food

I like the cold
i literally just go to fribley and eat pizza on mwf because i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to interact with anyone to get it
I just know that the same thing will probably happen at other colleges too tho
So idk if transferring fixes anything
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just beyond tired of being alive
And I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t drink Bc I am literally an alcoholic from an objective and genetic POV
so I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t escape it
And cigarettes kill u
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally just college
Wtf y'all should get help
I tried
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work after you go thru what I went thru
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at peace with the fact that this is a ü§° world we live in and there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no point in trying anymore
Me fucking too
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m only here Bc I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to traumatize people by not being here
Ive been trying to be more positive but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kinda bullshit
Bitch what the fuck do u want me to do then
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cough
Fuck em
And blow air at them

Sorry u had a bad experience tho, but finding the best counselor for u def helps, and therapy also takes time
And it differs from people to people, with different problems, experiences
Zombie for short
They won't stop till putin push the button lol. Yea good luck sanctioning everything from a country with nukes
Altho if I remember right after the cold war they kinda abandoned mutually assured destruction and went to more military targeted, smaller scale nuclear warfare
>MAD
>Not as high
Bruh what
I said they abandoned mad I think
I'm quite curious cuz MAD is apparently the best solution when they did the math
These fucking
But I'm an engineer so idk math
If Russia nukes the US the ethically correct decision is to just do nothing
ugh im bored
WTF
It still feels like january
How tf have I been going to class for 2 months
I miss where the only thing I had to be afraid of was killer clowns back in 2016

I only came to management today bc there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an assignment to turn in

I hate it here
i have had two friends who work at jolly quit bc they said they hated it
as a jolly employee it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just like any other food service job but people expect it to be no work and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why they quit
Work study jobs are supposed to be "easy"
But they're also supposed to pay half of what jolly does so üòÆ√¢‚Ç¨üí®
idk they just said it wasnt a good work environment
but my job is a lot of work but still very fun i love the environment

they dont have enough voting bloc friends to ever win
altho...they still do better than 0 pt UK
yet they almost won last time :thonk:
The song was universally hated back home, yet loved outside of home
People back home were FUCKING PRAYING that it doesn't win, no joke

esp given it was versus fucking soldi, arcade and scream
im mad 2020 never happened, could you imagine Uno (RU) winning
M√É¬•neskin deserved it tho

If this really is a dream, fuck all y'all because you're me and I don't like myself
That proves nothing
If I answer that question you'll be sad
No yeah, I will for sure, but I had never been and yet I said it was in Tink?
And that it never has a line???
Holy shit, so it wasn't a dream
OH
you still said it never had a line
It doesn't

Not having a car is the one and only thing that makes me bored
It could (and still can!) hold intricate erotic roleplay text conversations

There's a Tinder for people on the spectrum called hiki, best discovery I've made in a while wtf

I think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at the point in life where if my body does the fake fall sensation I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even fight it
I mean I already stopped fighting sleep paralysis
I forgot that men exist

He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s jealous lol
Damn @caileeee a year ago they were offering 15 an hour tips non inclusive wtf
Damn
business' bad rn
maybe they were down bad
my job being $15/hour and work study so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hardly taxed >>>
@caileeee hopefully they raise it soon that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so stupid. 12 an hour is still pretty good so far as jobs around campus go. They rly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be paying shit üíÄ
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re probably down bad Bc of covid
I applied 1.5-two years ago now but it was still during covid
ya im not eligibel for federal work study even tho i am broke
FUCK THE REST OF U
I HATE YOU ALL
i actually hate jolly and $12/hour at mitchell√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s is arguably better
seems like it!
look my job at home was $15/hr which is pretty high so i didnt really expect my job here to be more than that
but i think tips avergae aroudn $4/hr when its slow and it can get like way higher if its busy
jobs where you get paid decent money AND tips >>>
at my other job its literally just based on how long u work there LOL
intuitively i guess probably if they value you more you get paid more???
value isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the right word
In fact someone please become a saferide dispatcher
It's just me and one other person and it gets lonely
so ya that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kinda why i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want a job that is barely work LOL
bc if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna work might as well make it hard and busy so that time passes faster
It's just that you don't move much
shut the fuck up
oh so who does it overnight
I just hit my head on a 45-pound bar at Veale üò©
I've hit my head on the bar, my fridge, and some dumbbells all in the span of spring break
Now I'm randomly getting dizzy I'm not sure if I'm concussed or I just didn't eat enough during break cuz I only had like dinner
Damn
Sorry that was a bad joke
But I have a splitting headache rn
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I should go to sleep right after hitting my head tho
I've hit my head days ago
so I can go to sleep
Same shit
no problems
still dunno why
If the nausea is getting worse, taking medication for it is okay
Fixes 99 of your 100 problems
idk man i feel like managers do a lot
never owners or ceos tho
the customers though ü§Æ
Managers create the conditions in which other people work
Yeah sure why not harass a drive thru employee who already feels like taking a bath in the deep frier
I broke into where they store the electric scooters at night
I woke up with a light headache, but now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s as bad as it was before üò©
What are the hours?
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say what the hours are
i went to veale instead cuz the weight room was closed lol
Oh nah they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re only closed closed on fridays
Mon - thurs football only used half the racks
the door was locked tho :(
No it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wut
die
so i can go to the least populated room and do what i want
cuz football's there w you
i hate football
i hate seeing men when im working out
yeah but its scary
ya i kinda stopped going to the gym here bc wyant is so small so like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m always in close proximity to a man
i hate the gym
I've been getting into yoga and cycling lately and I like that better
nah bro aint no one got money for that shit
i was like damn u got money for that?
i feel like im always being judged
we need women√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only gym fr
I just want a home gym
Ion want nobody hear me yelling
can't yell in a public gym smh
@tsunderratedd I just use the bike I always used in high school to get around because my parents wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me drive but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m looking to invest in something nicer
Idk if Walmart is the best place but you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need something super fancy unless you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing lots and lots of miles on a weekly basis and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not at that point yet
@kaori_flute hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been to Macro in days
I think Monday
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to look like a Republican tho
As long as people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything stupid hopefully it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be fine
I mean I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting my booster soon Bc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been around 3 months since I had covid so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not as vaccinated as I can be
But I get so worried I look like a Republican when I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear a mask
idk I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m torn
it's still required in classrooms!
boo case
maybe if like they did one more week of testing and cases were low it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a bad idea
but damn they couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even wait
poor decision
too much pressure from the republicans i guess
aren't most colleges switching to mask optional?
i was joking when i said the school did it for that reason
but with Omicron basically doing nothing to the general population despite being the most infectious
people aren't taking covid as seriously anymore
it is what it is i guess
true american culture is just to forget something exists once u get sick of acknowledging it
like literally tests are due today
they couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have waited even till the weekend??
Walmart bikes fall apart really fast and they use bargain-basement parts, don't recommend unless you plan on getting rid of it after 2 years
a used bike from a decent brand that's been reasonably maintained should last a while

i walked back to my dorm already
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sad
I can't explain it :(
ok i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry bruh i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make@jt
when i make it it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look like that
its ok i wasnt really that hungry anyway tbh
sad
And honestly den doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t put enough turkey in their turkey blt
fuck you
I just walked to the infirmary and apparently it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s closed from 12 - 1 p.m. smh
It didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that online üòî
I just went to the library and did some studying
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually so bad like scheduling an appointment tf
If I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m dying I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna pick up the phone
to be fair i showed up pretty urgently one time w/o an appointment and they took me
when i fell down the stairs üò≠
i went to my chem lecture before going there though
not without telling me first that i should have made an appointment though
At least doc told me I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a serious concussion
I took it home during the summer but idk how people can do that if they're flying
also isnt the expensive
die
My doctor gave me a colonoscopy and was like we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going on! After I quit premed tho my digestive system settled down and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not normal but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s better than it was so I said fuck u doctor
It seems to have healed now judging by the state of the union
üò≠wtf
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never getting one again I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care they gave me fentanyl after I told them not to Bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve struggled w substance dependence in the past
There were other options and they just didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
@.littlejimmy covid made me slow down and realize that working towards being premed was so miserable and that I just wanted peace
If not for covid I would have made a terrible mistake and continued premed
Idk about now but it was actually quick last night. You can kinda guess based on the order number
i mean i just placed mine and it says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already done
so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true
That seems low so yeah I think so
oh ew
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like that one
Idk what is good at the Den?
I hate Den food
Actually I tried the mozzarella sticks last night and they weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad
bc if u ordered for me i am gone LOL
Did you know this is actually wrong
It's still a decent approximation since it's really the only way to compare traffic between days
Officially brain dead for the day
I just tried to have a good night√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sleep but my brain said nope you dreaming bout your ex tonight :NM_peepoHang:
i just tried to have a good nights sleep but my smoke detector said nope i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to malfunction
so i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m guessing my room set it off but i was asleep and my roommate wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there
Wasn't it drills
why did they want to get into 207 then üò≠
also the firefighters don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come for drills
In my high school our woodshop would always set off the fire alarm due to the dust n stuff in the air
Lmao I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so sorry
OH MY FUCKING GOD
I JUST REALIZED
AMAZON'S LOGO IS AN ARROW POINTING FROM A TO Z TO SYMBOLIZE THEIR ASPIRATIONS IT'S NOT A FUCKING SMILEY FACE
MY LIFE IS A FUCKING LIE
Dude arent you supposed to be getting yelled at rn?? ü§®
Dude aren't you suppose to be getting some bitches rn?? ü§®

I plan on working in AI to contribute to Roko's Basilisk, not out of fear of eternal damnation, but out of spite.
The only bad thing about Newport is that because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mentholated it lasts longer in ur system
I was crying and shitting myself Bc I thought my internship was going to nicotine test me but thank god it was just a blanket policy and didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t apply to interns
Why nicotine test like u can't smoke?
@speedbirdconcorde2 I work for UHs tech department and the hospitals blanket policy is to test everyone for nicotine. But Bc I have no patient contact apparently they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t test me
And I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even like teaching that much
@vrose7 I had a mental breakdown over the homework but figured it out. About to start the quiz
Wtf
he said to finish problem 2 by tmrw but i don't think I have the energy for that üò≠
My computer didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t charge for an hour so I was screaming crying emailing profs
I just want to sleep
bruh I can't believe we have both calc & physics exams on monday

I got a c on the last quiz that just got graded
I swear I do well on the shit I wing

Once I was late so I skipped class instead
Crying screaming this quiz is so much computation

Every day the men on this server lead me to the conclusion that the groupthink among men has made them brain dead
@jellieellie shes doing so well I accidentally lay on her tho :(((

Omg no
FUCK
@eekhannah I apologize for gaslighting you about the temperature, 20 minutes later the sun went away and it really was 45 degrees
Bruh there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a kid in my econ class that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s coughing and has a runny nose and shit
The coughing is sus tho
I hope to fuck it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just allergies
I have a runny nose and sniffle a lot and I get so worried everyone thinks I have covid
Rip to the ~40 people who won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
HOLY FUCK I GOT NUMBER 6
HOLy FUCK
omg
bc i dont know what portion control is
also traingle is so close to mitchells so ill be close to work
does anyone know how bad the elevators are in triangle
Elevators are fine, I've never had an issue. The problem is that there are only 2 for 10 floors so you can end up waiting a while to go up
bc i live in clarke rn and the elevators are like insanely slow
i mean i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use them now bc i live on the second floor
bc there is a 1 bedroom single apartment available AND I WANT IT SO BAD
bc if i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get one of the one bedroom apts in triangle one i need a backup preference
oh
did someone get a bad number
Damn
you cant be in multiple groups at the same time
If 1 doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work out
someone got a bad studio lottery number and asked to be in my group of 5 but we had already submitted üôÇ
if u get a bad number u can just exit out of the studio lottery and enter another group
if you want to find a group, you best be quick, cuz ppl are submiting them
we started being able to submit for 5 or 6 today at noon
and the lottery is at 3 on monday
no@they make it so that if u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get a studio u have time to enter the other ones
WHAT IF I DONT WORK OUT?? HUH??
ya i dont work out but maybe i would if i had a gym in my building
and then if i dont get those ill choose from triangle two
its cuz triangle 1 wasnt dorms
But that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not too bad
??????? really??
oh
damn
i'd go with 1 tho
you need to supply ur own lighting
damn
wasnt dorms
doesnt that just inherently make it nicer
I'm afraid I will spontaneously lose internet during my slot
cuz mine is 4:44
hopefully one person before me doesnt choose a one bedroom
what are the chances tho
i mean there has to be one person that wont want to be in a 10th floor one bedroom
i just dont see why anyone wouldnt want a one bedroom
whihc is hwy i dont think ill get one
maybe people dont like triangle 1
OMG STOP UR JUST MAKING IT SEEM LIKE MORE PEOPLE WANT WHAT I WANT LMAOO
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think you can
u just cant be in two groups at once
except more expensive
Why can't all ppl be like this
skip class
I read the initial question wrong
im stupid
i mean u prob wont get one bc thres only 5 of them
oh LMFAO
i mean ur still getting a studio
How is the queen still alive
This whole "she's immortal" thing started off as a funny joke but ion think this is a joke anymore
damn only 3 one bedrooms left
fuck
i cant yet
but still
if they cared that much they would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already snagged it
OMG THE NEXT PERSON DIDNT TAKE ON EITHER LMAOOO
help me i have one minute left
i havent used the elebators there
i mean i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really care
do u have room specifics yet, or just the number?
I am still waiting for the selection
idk what specifics u mean
yeah some floors of triangle 1 you won't see anybody at all leaving their room.
but last i saw triangle 1 was reserved for grad students right? is that now an option for undergrads?
oh okay. are they doing it all as singles or are they trying to give out doubles doubled up? (like 4 people to a double)
all the studios are still single occupancy
there were also a few junior one bedrooms tho which are still for one person (which is what i got)
oh cool. you will no longer be able to lock yourself out of your room anymore which is a small benefit but a nice one to have
i have done it multiple times unfortunately
I don't really have any grounds for comparison but I like being higher up
Idk if it's still like that
Idk how u can live through the summer without one
That's just an Amazon office
some people dont have ac in their homes
i like higher floors bc u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hear whatever happens on the street next to ur building
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on clark 2nd floor and i can hear everything outside of the building
man bro there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this one kid that like without fail at least twice a week goes right below my window and fucking screams his ass off on the phone
so annoying
towards the end of last semester, I heard a horrifying scream. it sounded like someone was screaming for their life. still dont know what happened
probably someone screaming for their life
damn
u might be able to find one
oh
i mean u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
u might be able to find another person in studio lottery that also didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get one
here's the problem, i don't want to
well i guess if u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care it don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter
but like, i don't want to
cuz its a .mov
oh
My sophomore yr they didn't make it explicit, but moving out was doing them a favor, so u fill out the normal living off campus as a non-upperclassman form with whatever reason they'll let u go. I can imagine how moving out rn is also doing them a favor
Be getting sensory overloads on the nose now walking around indoors without mask
I think you could get permission to live off campus, and like someone else said; you'd be doing them a favor
ac only works during the summer. like if you were there right now it would be no ac only heating technically. which is a no no for me because im hot all year long and always need cooling
when you rightclick the wrong place and accidentally worldedit away an entire 2 year old minecraft server
Oh I forgot case students can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cope w shit
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want it
how are we feeling 12 minutes before lottery numbers
yeah i noticed it was gone yesterday
my parents want me to use that excuse for my housing release request
Just, University housing got bad vibes, straight up
dont you work in housing, just change the flag in harld
and i would like money soo
cant be sneaky beaky when your bosses are literally big brother
he uses the database i have to use to change shit
damn
im bad
no hes shit
Anyone here got a stupid lottery number?
arent there only
so stupid
idk why this school is so bad at housing process
then again I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never tried to organize housing for over a thousand people at once so
idk how they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing that because my 5 person group only has options to fill suites with one person in them already (probably RAs)
anyone that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go is missing out so bad
Show was longer than I expected
No complaints tho
yoooo ok he's flaming journalists rn maybe he ain't that bad
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mention the word √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlabs√¢‚Ç¨
We have class, cocaine only
Wtf u got stj as a second ur?
those lotteries haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happened yet
Nah I dunno my lotto number till tmrw
grrr i wanted that one
i wanted 310 most and then 350
350 doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the elevator
we dont need elevator
cuz thers a door symbol there in the layout online
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had the door explained to me
oh
I am sorry @caratblink

but no i dont think we get like bookshelves
I wish I'm Albanian, the same nationality as God
@kaori_flute didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up for macro exam smh
Cuz that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s when class started
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also been a while since you showed up to class
as for class
it's early smh
lowkey i miss ernest
oh no
i feel so bad for the person i was talking to in the 2026 server
didnt turn in their financial aid on time üò≠
thats so sad
no doubt they wouldve gotten like most if not all of the rest of their tuition taken off
dont know how they are so calm
same I feel so bad
but i guess maybe the parents make enough that they dont care?
that actually feels so bad
like my stomach is turning in sympathy
I remember when my friend's dad refused to do the css profile so they couldn't go to case
honestly the css is so annoying for people who live in single family homes
bc i only live w my mom and sister and i literally have 0 contact with my dad and i basically had to "prove" that i dont talk to my dad nymore
my mom had to like go to the courthouse and ask our lawyer for a shit load of documents so the css could waive the need for my dad's income information
its literally such a stupid fucking system
it was soooo annoying
had to write like a whole 5 paragraph essay on why i dont think my dad will contribute to my college
how do you prove you dont have contact w someone like üò≠
I think I would rather not go to college than reach out to my father
"hey can u jsut like write about how my father is a piece of shit and wont contribute to my college?"
So it makes the fafsa shit confusing
also im pretty sure he started doing to because he didn't want to pay child support
yeah my dad left the country too to avoid child support
A sad windmill
@alexthedawg shut UP GOD DAMN
Hypothetically can I attend college classes without paying for them if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re large lecture hall classes
Yes but u won't be getting a degree, which is the thing u actually pay for
i was thinking about that last semester i was like if i wanted instead of attending this class i could attend a different class happening at the same time and no one would even notice that i wasnt where i was supposed to be
Ah shit I have forgotten about aleks
btw if anyone in a 2P or 4P hasn't gotten a space or they don't think you'll get one, fill out the campusgroups form in your email to be a candidate for a space in clarke or STJ
Idk where im living next year
Ran out of slots üôÇ
So idk what happens from here
oh no
Ya üò¶ I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m like rly sad rn it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably stupid of me but this was just a really bad day for me
Well, a lot happened today without a doubt what can I say
I ate too much food now my tummy is hurting
at least you didn't spot me tripping on the curb and falling on my face 2 mins after leaving dunkin
oh no
i am so close to dropping everything rn
remember, you always have one pass fail per semester. but you have to pick before the final
or you can rather but you'd need to retake it
Wtf is with all the people on tink second floor, a quiet study area
anybody want to try to write CWRU on r/place?
and this specifically applies to math
holy shit you got the osu ppl on your side????
oh it didnt occur to me that you might mean OSU the school
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just wondering
and if that was me i would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just sat down and ate my food
its not like the employee really cares either
@pinkfluffyunicorn999 You left your physics exam in SAGES (Crawford Hall)
at least that isn't embarrassing
I didn't pick it up, but it's still at Crawford Hall
Dw I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell anyone your grade lol
Apparently a lot of ppl been getting sick lately üíÄ
I got sick on Friday
Idk why so many people are getting sick rn
I got sick last week
Damn
Well no one has stopped him so far. I told a doctor at the clinic about this and she said he should be reported
It hasn't happened to me but several people I know had this happen
That's why I was so worried about getting COVID
Even if it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t affect u
@alexthedawg ordered jolly and never picked it up
how hard is math 201
I'm in math 307 and we compare and 307 can really be killer depending on who you take it with
19 all the way, it's not that bad
linear algebra is not like calculus at all, so it takes a bit of getting used to but 201 isn't that hard for me rn
Someone at the gym used the leg curl machine as a leg extension üíÄ
Why do y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all hate us? ;-;

I'm on Thinkbox while a massive tour is here lol, now I can understand what it feels like to be Harambe, in the Cincinnati zoo
Damn bro
you don't even know me lmao
I mean idk TAs tend to be upperclassmen
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think anyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s better than some of the csds TAs who already have jobs lined up for example
Idk I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean to be mean i guess I just mean it depends on lots of things?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m scared of the data structures TAs üò¶
Sorry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m rly bad at reading social situations

166 is easy so don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stress abt it
i just dropped it because i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a strong bio background
Idk the class moved quickly but it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to completely understand it since it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pass fail
Is biol 216 lab a lot of work tho
I did not get into biol 216L and I need it for my major
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that fill up
maybe you just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cuz yours isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t real
Yeah but why would I want to do that
I want to take a 3d modelling class
Yesterday jolly shut down early and cancelled my order
But they didnt give the swipe back
Im going to shit and scream

cannot move without it squeaking
sherman ones arent

hi sorry about that
not really
the new furniture isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even better than the old furniture :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed:
some of the juniper buildings have nicer kitchens but otherwise there isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a huge difference
either toxic asf or chill asf
oh and the bedroom doors in taplin don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t close automatically
it is generally kind of one or the other tho
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t notice u closing it
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nice but sometimes you leave at 9am and your roommate texts you at 10am to tell you you left the door open as she slept
omg
omg sorry
omg annie
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll never guess what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing in july
I feel so old now
Say it ain't so
omg this is so me when the turbulence wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t forecasted
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s almost like @addat asking me if i would be in rhode island at the beginning of the summer like no shit dipshit where else would i be? prague?
u know I am bad with dates jen it is in my bottom three skills
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry i would ask mitski to change it if i could
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never even been to vermont
I literally don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know when my friend sonia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s birthday is and I have known her since 2nd grade
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know what month it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in
I wish I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t born in July 13 can u think of a worse combination of numbers
AND it means I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a cancer so my horoscope is always like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou behave like a woman and it makes everyone hate you√¢‚Ç¨ and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like damn ok astrology
idk what being a libra says about me

If you're bad at chemistry it's not
it's just a pain in the ass to do
gosh im such a bad boy
i was supposed to be sleeping by 7pm
My choccy milk has already gone cold
This feels like a reason to have a massive student protest
Idk, it just seems like something that kids do
I missed the chocolate part so I thought my boy was just putting straight milk into the microwave
Stop asian hate
arson come on that lame. I'm not saying we should mix up some mustard gas but, in not not saying it
I'd send an email to your navigator too and let them know so if there's a pop quiz or mandatory attendance or something you can't get hornswoggled by a prof
Then there's the profs who just don't care and will give you a 0 even if you have COVID
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so unfair wtf
is it worth to drop a class i wanted to take next semester bc the final is literally on the last day of the exam period
and it would leave me with a less than one month break
In one of my classes right now a bunch of my friends are just planning to take an L on the final and get a 0 since it's on the last day of finals
i mean theres no reason i have to take that class specifically but it was just the one i was interested in
like i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure i could easily find another class/take it another semester
i found another class thats online once a week with no final exam
I have an exam on the 19th
Is it for a required class?
I got 2 finals
Hey I aint complaining
why would u wanna be on campus longer thsn necessary
When are you leaving
oh no I have an exam on the 20th whyyy
go to community college
Even though my last final is on the 29th
my last final is also the 29th but i think i have a paper due on the 1st
i left very early last semester and now i get to leave very late
the 29th is early
i cant leave until the 7th
my last final is on the fifth :sadcat3:
allowed to leave as late as the 8th at 3pm and allowed to return on the 14th of august i think
anybody in the MWF discrete math class and want to swap with me (i'm in the Tu/Th class)
i just declared my chemistry major and guess who my advisor is
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not doing TERRIBLE in his class
after that exam though üò¨
Fair
Still tho my advisor doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to know those details loll
it *was* wyatt newman but apparently it isnt actually him
but it still says him in sis
my primary advisor doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t teach a class and she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s new to cwru
Cuz my navigator emailed me when I had a 33 in chem üíÄ
Nah he didn't
A prof that advised several of my friends left Case in the middle of last semester and didn't tell anyone so they got assigned new advisors after waiting for a while and nobody explained what was going on
Apparently she used to refuse to meet advisees even before she left the uni
I want to know what it would be like to time travel back to the late 1300√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Britain and give a peasant farmer a bag of takis
if you order a milkshake from jolly tonight it will be made with hate
oh
I got a damn fish today and it was pretty good
rip
if you want overlap, go for neuro or bio but you can literally major in anything. i would just avoid engineering because it gets REALLY tight
if u ever have a bug problem then it is u that is the problem because you are probably dirty and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t clean ur room
i read this cwru article on the observer about someone waking up to a bug on their arm
like only way that happens is literally if u are a person with bad habits and u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to clean
i forgot what i was going to say
Also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a menace and leave popcorn all over the common room floor bc once that happened in storrs and there was a single roach
oh shittt
i need to know
Yeah I heard that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really bad
Mm depends on what you want more. Bme or premed
I mean as long as you have good GPA and mcat shouldn't you get into med school?
You could stick to what you have now and feel it out
dont you need a "story" + national accreditation + thousands of hours in ECs
was it the weather
I always knew UC was meh but our state program is worse
damn
the weather is bad but i also have severe mental health issues that i won't discuss publicly lol
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like a ray of sunlight every week during the winter months
dont they have artifical suns now
And USC... that didn't end well.
Oh shit
I realized
someone needs to make them pay
I don't think a joint mech aero degree is going to do me a service gpa wise
Haven't heard of that
and is that a bad thing or...?
we don't need a homophobic '21 on our server for 2025 students üòä
honestly you can tell everything you need to know about a person if they still use the term √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSJW√¢‚Ç¨ unironically in 2022
L so big the lurker stopped lurking
just out here doing god's work
it's sad that that person is premed too
Just wondering what the dropout rate is in the engineering programs?
Idk if there's statistics for that
Only through 2015 tho
As an engineering major, I don't have any friends who dropped engineering
I have friends who are upperclassmen tho like??
I've been really solid in math, not so much in physics mechanics, aka the intro physics course at case
Not a physics pro tho
To be fair I don't study in that class
physics is applied math tho
fair
thats still physics
Which isn't as bad as a general physics course
its different tho
still phys
It's not that bad, there is only a difference of 2-3 courses between the mechanical and aerospace engineering track
Depends heavily on the classes. "biochem proper" courses tend to be stratified towards either miserable or incredible.
damn
yeah, so there is really nothing to obtaining a MechE/Aero degree, and a lot of people pursue this track because it's flashy
idk if its for aero aswell, but sometimes they dont offer the electives each year, so make sure u have backups
Not really but they have specific programs
so close but so far vibes
damn
Fake your death and get 7 more
time spent studying ig
No, sorry, I made a typo
idk why I'm worried about this I will never have to take the MCAT
u did bad on the mcat? you have a 3.0 now. cope
you did bad on the mcat? 1.8 GPA. cope.
sat vibe with college apps
1.8 gpa after 4 bad tries
it just keeps going down
However it probably won't go away because it specifically tests you on what you learned in your undergrad premed classes
thats so scary
I just took it 8 days ago and it wasn't a fun experience
*the FE exam starting down my neck*
no they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just annoying
Most people aren't, and therefore it's REALLY evident when you have a gunner or other miserable person
there's def annoying premeds
damn name drop
aint he a 145 si
yeah, but he does not put in any work
i heard people shitting on emily saying she didnt do shit where ansh did everything and it made me angry cuz its so false
Every year about 450-550 people come in as premed and about 140-180 end up submitting a med school app
damn
IK IT MADE ME SO MAD
when i visited it felt like they forgot to render in people it was so dead
thats so annoying
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have bad mental health
as much as ppl hate on it, it's actually rly nice :)
idk why
This is one of those things that depends highly on who you ask. I personally find it super enjoyable, and the common factor between those people who tend to hate on it is that they don't really leave campus
isnt tink the airport
also its literally what u make of it!!!! if you just decide u hate it like it's gonna suck but you can totally have fun and its super gorgeous if u actually get out
howdy is the only exception cuz hes from cle
I also find that there is a pretty high correlation between sheltered-ness and hate of cleveland
Cleveland is legit an upgrade in everyway except the football team
does the food suck
I can't live w bad food
I literally did a presentation with a cold open trashing the cleveland browns in school
babs is no longer the president </3
oh
i get scared to cook in my common room
u can have a suite kitchen starting sophmore yr
the ivies seems dinky asf
SHUT THE FUCK UP
jk idk never been
IDK BUT MY ROOM ALWAYS SMELLS BURNT BECAUSE OF IT
5 times a week i think i started an electrical fire but its actually just ppl in the common room who cant cook
im tired of hs its so boring i wanna get that good good biochem :chefs_kiss:
dont say that in front of an ra for my community
ive never started a fire in my dorm
but it was NOTHING and my heartrate jumped so badly because i was asleep
but i can't double bc one is BA and one is BS
oh can i do biochem bs and neuro ba then
neuro cant be a BA
depends on what you want to do w/ ur degree
Accept that you're not going to be perfect, and also that being knocked down or doing bad on something isn't the end of the world. People who get 4.0s and 52X on their MCAT at the price of living in a vacuum or doing ECs they don't care about are going to struggle heavily in interviews.
med schools want human being
u do not need a 4.0 to succeed
you need 2 or more
I do not have near a 4.0 and I'm applying this cycle for med school
tho idk if biz majors are less than 2
idk if i shud gun bsmd or ed somehwere for undergrad
RIP
bs/md programs are kinda sus because some of them require you to work in the state for the same duration of your med school years
thats mad sus
you're prematurely limiting your options as well since some BA/S/MD programs don't let you apply to other med schools if you take a spot in their med school
The cycle doesn't even open for you until like october right
case was supposed to be my match but then quickly turned into my only good option ngl
Case admissions doing gods work with no essays
it was a good take because i'd have gone to my state school if i didn't apply to case
You should be eyeing your homework
Things never said at CWRU
fair
hw never done for me
in college the homework never ends
oh
because i know someone who brought a prospie in
OMG
last one is slower
i had a friend who was keeping track of how soon after the clock turned over drew meyer said OOKAYYYYYY
how does clicker q work
damn
all u need to know
it's not bad
yea they werent too bad from what i was watching
i thought i had a file of him going CLIGRQUESTIN GO but i dont
oh god did the soundboard get taken down???
i cant get onto the site
i work in thwing i eat in thwing i do my homework in thwing
that wasnt the building tho
i don't like to climb through windows anymore
actually i don't like to get PULLED through windows anymore
you dont know about the thinkbox?????
oh
but they stopped that
this is horrible
you still can i thought
they might have stopped due to rona then
i've only been there once though
arent there multiple
andrej and i got into the building when it was supposed to be locked and the guy there was like wtf are you doing in this room
wtf is the bme building
it's the one with the giant clock idk what it's called
okay i am going to go away now i need to write a paper
you know how if u leave the like main quad there's like the hospital and then behind the hospital is a building with a giant fucking clock at the top
i dont know what literally any of the buildings are called except for sackstroker
isnt that the med school
u cant be here
well someone told me it was the bme building so i guess i was LIED TO
i walked in and tired to hide the fact that i was hser and they called me down
the worst name on campus is the nursing research building
like wtf
i think wickinden has a bad name
it's a bad building
i have my math final there
ive never been to the nrb im scared of it
my math recitation is in glennan <3
oh wow i can't wait to goose chase to my math final
i didnt have to walk to it in the snow but i imagine trying to find NRB in the winter is a nightmare
brb is under med school i think
so it can be labelled med school but it's not THE med school
but that isnt fucking communicated so youre just like where am i rn
like why is that building so bad
and the signs directing you to rooms leave out like half the rooms :cursed_flushed:
it took me two months to actually figure out how to get to my recitation before that i would just leave an extra 10 minutes early in case i got lost
Prof delayed due date of homework but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t delay when the solutions would get released oops
Unfortunately I had already spent 9 hours on the homework when I realized
covid is the best thing that happened to me in a while
I had an accounting exam today that I thought was on wednesday
Had to run from weatherhead to taft and back to get my laptop too
bro my bio teacher said and i quote "case is stupidly hard, for no good reason. Find another school"
fair
this man got phd at penn and post doc at cmu so idk
he didnt go to case tho
he wanted to torture kids after years of research ig üíÄ
Does your high school cost more than a car per semester
its sus magnet tho bruh
grades didnt even matter
I went to a high school where there was a soybean field and we had drive your tractor to school
the majority of people from my high school do not go on to get a college degree
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the 19th and jen turned 19
I wish my bday was tomorrow
Anyone got a 420 bday tho?
i was gonna go see them in columbus last november but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end up getting a chance to drive down
not surprised the comments on the reveal post were all shit
just bc u don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know who they are doenst mean nobody else does
last year we had a knock off billiam eyelash
idk
I mean someone did lie abt that lmaoooo (not u ofc
how are they not spring fest vibes tho
I don't know though
I don't listen to them, I just am recalling what my friends have felt about them
Apparently those aren't cornrows, those are just normal braids so it's ok? Then again, I haven't looked into it
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they have phoebe bridgers last year üò≠
wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it over zoom
wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t he the one w fans that killed somebody during his concert?
also ya that joke wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t funny some guy literally died
over a fucking concert
Tf are you on about? Travis scott has millions of fans and would put on objectively better concert since everyone knows who he is. Also, don't accuse someone of making a joke about someone dying.
"also ya that joke wasn't funny some guy literally died over a fucking concert"
Travis Scott does suck though
did i do something wrong
sorry
like genuinely im@not sure what ur upset about
defending a guy who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t@give a shit about them
No I was looking at the messages and it looked like you were accusing theo of making a joke about someone dying
i heard from like two different people that they tried to get different artists but couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
oh
but i missed out on seeing chase atlantic in november
I still maintain they should have booked Kanye and Pete Davidson
oh
i heard that from someone else and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember who
Fuck Skete ü§®üñïüèº
at this shitass small private school
Oh shit, Chase Atlantic are gonna be performing????
some are shit i will say
Angeline, call me back, slow down, into it
They took down the post for the springfest artist it seems
Even though it's subjective
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be so sad if they change it
i feel like everyone just hopping on the hate chain
half the people prob don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know who they are
just wanna look cool and find another thing to hate about the school
i hate the people at this school
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they understand that there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no shot of getting another artist
I mean, you might be bias on this given you are a fan but shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t ignore the majority opinion on it still
like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s literally happening on saturday what do they think is gonna happen
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not even majority opinion tho
They said nothing about cancelling it
if they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cancel a lot of people are still gonna show up
regardless of what the people who don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like them think they are still insanely popular
I think you just need to calm down a bit. And yes they will because our college fees goes into it, still doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re happy with the artist they bring
nah bro i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sick of these chronically online people picking and choosing who to hate
based on shit that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even bad,,
kinda annoying
I haven't heard of them before, but ppl still listen to tons of artists who do bad shit
literally just seems like people were expecting someone better so now they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re trying to start controversy to explain why they should perform
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand what@these students think is gonna happen
ya makes me so upset
didn't one of them say racial slurs?
idk did they?
idk i don't think it's right to dismiss it as "not that bad" esp if you're not part of the offended group
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not that bad
yes it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bad
I don't think its really fair for ppl to try to pick and choose abt it tbh. There are so many artists who do and say bad shit and get away with it
so then why would spring fest choose them tho if they did something bad like that tho
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get
idk
and esp bc some of the artists the people are suggesting have done the same shit
they just want them cause they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re more popular
I guess they're upset that this group is being invited here. I mean if it was someone else who did something equally problematic there would probably be as much criticism
ok so i just looked up what happened and one of the members said the n word in a cover of a song he did 8 years ago
idk where it is i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just reading off a reddit post
I think the thing that I don't really like is how Student activism is often performative, and this is really just another example of this
ya idk i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find any like actual tweets or apologies
cant even find the original sources where they said slurs
perhaps they were all taken down
cause not even an apology is anywhere
like, does it really matter at the end of the day even if he said something like this? There are so many issues globally that matter so much, and something like a random artist covering a song and saying an abhorent word isn't really an issue that I think people should be raising hell over. Political change that matters is ignored for things that end up not actually changing anything.
and it seems like if they did all this bad stuff they are not doing it now + they are actuvely supporting the black community?
not trying to defend the actions, obvs it is a really bad thing, but it isn't like fighting against this band will change anything
if you're not in the offended community it isn't really your place to say
but it seems like we already have held them accountable?
like thats the thing i just dont understand what people expect
i dont even think some pushback against them is bc of this i think most people just genuinely want someone more famous
shit like that
I mean I can't complain because I wanted vulfpeck which has like 1/3 the followers of chase atlantic
vulfpeck would be fucking üî•
yeah I kinda think so too because I didn't really know about the allegations and I didn't know that there was stuff they did people associated with them and got confused thinking there was something they did that gave them a bad rep to their name that a lot of people know about
bc the intial pushback was literally people just complaining that they wanted someone better
cant say i saw any of that
i guess last time i looked was last night
Apparently they wont be performing is what I heard idk who pulled the plug
we can have both discussions simultaneously. what they did was wrong and they should be held accountable. at the same time there are people who just wanted something different.
the devil works hard but case students between the hours of 3am-8am work harder ig
can't believe we cyberbullied away a band with 1m followers
im sad
and very upset
in other news I started rapping a few days ago and am currently taking gigs, I'd be down to headline springfest
well i guess students dont want to do anything about actual racism so they fight back against a fucking band to make people think they are anti racism when they are in fact just complicit
i hate it here
why cant we put this enegery into literally anything else more important
I respect your choice in music and all, but if a big group of people are upset over a band making racial comments towards their race and a big part of campus who have expressed their opinions didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bit selfish to put your own choices before all that. Just my opinion.
no like im serious
It's such superficial activism imo. If you want to make real change, go volunteer or work with a grassworks policy advocacy group. It's just a liberal twist to the culture war issues you see pushed by some ppl on the right.
And to just disregard all that for personal choice in music idk how i feel about it
yeah, not trying to argue or anything, idrc either at the end of the day
i mean it's not unique to this school, at all
sad part
that being said it not a bad thing to call artists out for being racist
its sad that thats "cheap" with what case wastes our tuition on
I think that's what springfest needs
yk what didnt we have echosmith a few years back
didn't know it was made by a Nazi
but like the school took it down for a bit bc of an event happening there but they put it back up immediately after
In 1993, when asked by Vanity Fair about his past political views, he said, "I have no excuse (for) such unbelievable stupidity. ... I don't know how you expiate guilt."[11][54][53]

In 1956, he donated a design for Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel in Port Chester, New York. Architecture professor Anat Geva observed in a paper that "all critics agree that his design of the Port Chester Synagogue can be considered as his attempt to ask for forgiveness."[12]

He discussed his trips to Germany and his infatuation with fascism in a 1996 interview with Charlie Rose. He said, "It was the stupidest thing I ever did, and I never forgive myself and I never can atone for it. There's nothing I can do... That's been torture to me ever since."[55] He admitted to Rose that, while he had "difficulty" with Franklin D. Roosevelt because of his inability to achieve what he set out, he "worshiped the man" and "voted for him four times."[55] Replying to Rose asking if he liked "strong figures", he said "Sure do. I like good architects that are strong, like Gehry."[55]
(also from wikipedia)
I think it should be removed, but seems like he asked for forgiveness?
yup cause we go to a greedy ass school
oh oh, they've moved 2ft
and they fell off again
I wish this globalist jewish cabal had better dental care because I think the nerds candy at target melted holes into my gums
thats like half the fun of it tho
when the sugar granules get stuck in the incorrectly sewn up cavity where my wisdom teeth used to be
tbh they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re probably still going to perform
yeah and since my mouth is genetically way more acidic than normal people it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worse for me
their music is hype tho
its like half depression half really hype
if u hate chase atlantic so much stop watching tiktok bc like so many of their songs are just popular tiktok sounds
last year it was just billiam eyelash lvl "woe is me"
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t watch tiktok ü•≤
oh
people have tried
case doesnt own their house
so they cant kick them off
if not official case frat I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re official in nationals either
didnt they get taken off a few years ago
idk lots of frats r shit
it was a diff one, it was the one that was worse than zbt, i have no clue what the name was
who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
not a single one of them has to do with a band performing one time that we will never contact again
admin literally dont give a shit, they get paid the good bucks to not care
stop actively putting people at risk of death
fucking stupid people
ouch
yeah holy shit have you seen the positivity rate on campus lately
it sucks
and 35 minutes away from stj
case sucks
didnt we ignore sexual harassment cases
ok guys gonna go listen to chase atlantic on my way to work someone report me to the white saviors
ok isnt chase atlantic racist
that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s essentially what everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mad about i fuess
and i think some people are mad that one of the members girlfriend√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s says the n word but she is half black so that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not really valid
Damn
i just went to wade and they straight up couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find my mail
wtf
my shoes are not here yet
fedex lost my $800 glasses
so im stuck with the glasses I got when I was 14
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they have to reimburse you
wow i wonder what could possibly be causing the positivity rate to go up in the last few weeks
His lost glasses?
why isn't myhealthconnect letting me check into an appointment
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cuz the university lifted the mask mandate right after spring break
and stopped requiring testing
jealous
I'm glad Chase Atlantic isn't allowed on campus. Racism should never be tolerated anywhere. I actually didn't even know they said racist shit, I just thought that people were overreacting of them culture appropriating their hairstyles.
because if they did a shit ton of bad stuff
and here I was thinking they couldnt top billiam eyelash over zoom from last year
if you want artists you plan multiple months in advance
Some haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even apologized yet
case students wanna be activists then be activists about the all the shit that matters
the money is not about reversing damage
Money has never meant sincerity
then what do you want people to do when they do terrible shit like that
bc even if money can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reverse the damage done it is still money going to a good place
bc in my opinion there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a lot that artists can do except apologize and donate to a cause bc if they do anything in private then people will just continue to assume the worst and attack them
Damn
Sometimes we just need to admit our mistakes
Sometimes we just need to stop having confirmation bias
i just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand what else u want them to do
Supporting them still isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t right
But thats just my opinion idk
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fuck with racism that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all
racism is bad
name every person/artist/any figure u support and if they haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t done racist shit i will actually applaud u
btw did you find their apology? I still haven't seen it
i haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t looked for the actual one yet tbh
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been at work
I respect your opinion I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t approve of racism
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t either
never said i did
We need to hire this artist https://open.spotify.com/artist/5PW5RClZLxsabCvZsgRXcK?si=lpar3fsnSY-_j11U3cNZyg&utm_source=copy-link
but they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t racist anymore
Just because they did a pr stunt doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not racist anymore
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have one
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnymore√¢‚Ç¨
i been at work
It's all our money
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not racist anymore√¢‚Ç¨ sure everyone supports racists
Doesn't matter, we need to collectively decide
but we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
We just dont
Damn why would you even be friends with smomeone who approves of racism
I feel like this conversation has completely derailed üíÄ
Ok. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re past racists so its ok sorry
like unless y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all wanna actually listen to what i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m saying i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not gonna participate in this anymore
Want more?
I only listen to bands in Polish bc i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to tell if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re saying anything bad tbh
if this school genuinely cared about racism and they did something about everything else shitty that happened on this campus then it would be valid
yes just like i accept every other person who made a shitty mistake in the past but is genuinely sorry and atones for it
My genuine opinion on this no trolling is that I literally do not give a fuck
bro if ur so thirsty for it go look for it god damn
I'm trying I literally can't find it
There isnt an apology so we cant find it
artists can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything in private bc then people will still get mad so they have to do things in public so people are aware of their sincerity. but when they do it in public it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a PR stunt
am i wrong??
bc i really am not
if they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do something in public people should continue to think they were not sorry for their actions
chase Atlantic? More like chase gigs until someone doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fire you lol
a known predator who sexual harassed my undersage friend when they came to this school and sat outside of pierce during orientation week to get freshman girls to come up to his room
Bro, do see how you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re sounding rn? Trying to cancel me for following a case student or Ohio politician. If he did something go report him, what you after me for? Stop being mad that people aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t defending a racist band cmon
all that got done was he was stopped from being an OL
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find out until like 2 weeks after orientation, when ppl were talking abt it at quizbowl
u cant pick and choose
I mean I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think Rob is really at fault for following him tbh, idk. I know ppl left of center that followed Donald trump because they thought his stuff was funny
you cant act like you are so much more morally high than people who support a band who apologized for their racism and donated to the community they hurt, and then turn around and support and follow sexual assaulters and people who want to take away women's rights
sorry i dont wanna support a president who actively worked to take away my rights as a minority woman
Bro Cailee stop it. You really need to see how you seem saying these. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re better than this.
What the fuck is happening
Do you want to take responsibility for your arguments regarding Chase Atlantic or do you want to shift blame and topics and go for Rob?
I have no idea what happen
Trying to compare something completely different doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t prove or justify your point. You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t justify their racism. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re defending a racist band that went on record for it. I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t defend anyone. Stop clowing
i dropped it for 6 hours and i come back to people trying to continue it
chase atlantic aren't performing here that's it end of story
I don't think Cailee realizes her confirmation bias
oh shit did you tell her?
dont think you know what confirmation bias is
she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always so patient with me even though I suck
no I do, you're the one trying so hard to defend racists who did pr stunts
She√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s basically saying we shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have bec they were racist in the past now they arent üíÄ
yall keep claiming pr stunt as if what they did didnt help hundreds of people and they entire blm cause
Bec they paid money to some orgs
Maybe step away from discord for a bit and study or sleep or something
nope didnt pay money they raised money for the gianna floyd fund and apologized for their action
which he never apologized for
I'm still waiting the evidence of apology?
1. Never coming forward to publicly acknowledge their wrong doings. 2. Never properly addressing the issue 3. Seeks to solve their problem through monetary means.
DO YOU SEE HOW FUCKING STUPID YOU ARE
Idk are you in taft
"they didnt do anything publicly but when they did something publicly i dont accept it because its a PR stunt"
This sounds like the classic √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry we got caught doing a racism√¢‚Ç¨
Oh it is you
yall are so chronically online it actually hurts

350 per semester when coa is like 80k isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that much bec I feel its a pretty big difference if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re cool with sharing a room. Fin aid won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cover the difference if I get it but I started s part time gig recently

I just said "fuck it" for the second shortest paths

And I'm now working on a graph diagram
And go mad
HOLY FUCK
Ok I deadass just changed nothing and the errors went away
Does someone know Hudson Relay?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure my shortestPath method is close to working
imagine being able to walk alone at night
true, imagine being able to walk alone at night without worrying that @rsgsockcheck might be right behind you.
I was there for 10 minutes and then I had to run back and change into short clothes
probably would have passed out or something otherwise
thats fair
Damn
U forgot chainsaws
U don't need a permit, and it even looks intimidating to start with. Only 50 bucks on Amazon
Is jolly closed??
lmao I couldn't find the old icon in my server list
You've still got another 4 months before you do
ngl new icon sucks
Had a hard time finding this server
Thought I couldn't complete my daily post of misinformation
Idk, I like it
i can change the icon again i mostly just wanted to switch it because the old one still had christmas garlands
We need to be inclusive of every religion. Christmas is just for Christians and many students are not Christian so ty for changing it to normal √¢Àú√Ø¬∏
Aleks really out here thinking I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna do 19 topics today instead of just taking the 88%
So it's, idk, 90%
You act like I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t already a step ahead
I felt too bad to leave it in the 80s
Their cheesesteak sandwich wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too good tho
Yo I was wondering, with HBO go shut down and ignite tv also shut down or not working, does case have any sort of complimentary streaming services for stufents?
Or they wont let you use wifi again
If they dont like the ip
And they wont give you access until UTech is confirmed to have wiped your laptop
Wtf
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna need to have a VPN for this shit
Dependings on the torrenting service
Nope
Yeah but this means I need to go out of my way to get a VPN
Very sad
Someone else√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s plan
Nord is bad
Their user base are typically people who dont know enough about the tech to avoid the platform
Wow I actually never thought about that
Theres a reason most tech people consider Norton and McAfee to be viruses themselves
Idk what hma is
Btw, if you want to go off the deep end on computer sec, watch this guy
Basically, anything made in hollywood is dangerous to torrent without a vpn
Why would you even download them tbh
What if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m feeling adventurous and pirate a horror movie
Thats still downloading
okay also does it count as pirating if you dont download it
Theres nothing smart going on in hollywood, so impossible scenario
That is still downloading
Yea dont
At any given moment the cwru networking team can fuck you up
Oh shit
Damn is he local expert
@sobdge Theo is pulling your leg, UTech can't and won't wipe your laptop
As a technological grandpa I feel taken advantage of
Jk. No, they won't do anything to it
Damn Is this live footage
They told a guy he his laptop was part of a botnet because he used utorrent lmao
Utorrent is bad
Cuz they 100% will force u to wipe
OH NO
@sobdge plz don't play video games in college
DONT PLAY DOTA 2
idk i started over covid
dont weird champ me @howdy_.
My brother in christ its never too late
I wish i could give you my experiences bc once youve seen the things ive seen you would never touch video g*mes ü§¢ again and youd make sure your children and your childrens children never touch them either
I think ive probably seen worse o.o
but it was at an age when I was able to become desensitized to it
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listen to them they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re trolling @sobdge
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t quite understand this sense of humor
Were being dead serious
I guess
Oscar goes to anime conventions dont listen to him@sobdge
Karl a G for responding so late

You can even get financial compensation if you prove the ad pissed in your corn flakes

Almond joys r the best wtf

Game literally looks worse than when ow originally came out
They tried so hard to move into moba territory
For someone who doesn't care to reply to emails, Drew Meyer sure knows how to spam the fuck out of students emails.
I emailed him 2 times and he still hasn't replied
go to his office hours and ask him about it
He couldn't spell ur name
I tried at 7:30, nothin
@rsgsockcheck how are you feeling about our upcoming chem 106 exam
Dude chem is going to fuck me in every single hole @eekhannah
did u go to his office hours
If he doesn't reply in time and I get below a C, I'm going to ask the department to do a review
on the basis that I couldn't P/F because I couldn't assess my progress in the class
if you go to his office hours he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be forced to answer you üò≠
Lol I went to his office hours and he gave me a shit fuckin attitude
like sorry mr. professor, I was throwing up everywhere and had an illness but sorry ur ego is hurt you have to make me do a makeup exam üò¢
The more I review chem 106 the more I realize I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember anything
E3 was so bad omg
Although still I only need like a 70 here to get an A
and also in schmitt we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have clock until there was 20 minutes left
i did bad on two exams bc i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t study for E1 because my ego was ginormous
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m literally done after this exam so my mental is gone
i have a paper due sunday night and then i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m done
it actually wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too too terrible i think
it was kind of ridiculously easy except i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the knowledge to do a few of the explanations properly
^ yep I held myself during the other written portions but the FRQs I couldn't explain shit
I really wish for this upcoming Ohio's election that demoncrat congresswoman Shontel Brown loses so hard she does not run for office every again
fuck her distasteful, unskippable youtube ads
being in the bay area while primary season approaches is a nightmare because every single ad is like BIG GOVERNMENT WANTS TO REGULATE CRYPTO, BUT THEN YOU AND I WONT BE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY BY EXPLOITING IT
missing double-double
oh
u are 30 minutes away from me
my home is close to silicon valley
dude do you want to see a squirrel i saw today
just 20 minutes drive from valley fair
no thoughts. head empty. the only work i have left to do as a freshman is a paper.
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s annoying
she don't know where I'm from
i just ping evan and he never speaks he only ever speaks on his own accord
even tho it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t light up yellow
my brain still processes it as you pinging me
there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t as many startups in Fremont but a lot of tech employees live there
in n out is shit
I guess it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mostly just silicon valley bc no one can actually afford to live in real Silicon Valley anymore
cuz houses in Silicon Valley are expensive
my family moved in like 5 years before housing went completely haywire otherwise we would not have been able to buy our house
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me started on silicon valley attitudes about affordable housing my dad is on town council he has been being harassed by racists for like three years about the state mandated housing reform
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhy can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t THOSE PEOPLE just take the bus√¢‚Ç¨
can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to never be in the state of california again :uniqua: :pablo: :pablo:
i miss my home
what weather
you mean the water we haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had for fifteen years
in 4th grade we started having more indoor recesses per year from smoke than from rain
i miss the sun
except when it goes up to like 105 in the summer and then they shut off the power lines
the only good thing about california is that if obergefell gets overturned I can still get gay married here
That half my income goes to income tax
you should try being a billionaire then they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make you pay any taxes
@legendsexile if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gay, and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gay, and we get married, will we still be able to get a marriage certificate in a red state once the supreme court overturns obergefell v hodges
sorry that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting political I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a little tipsy
not that I drink alcohol that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t legal so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it

@howdy_. where im from looks more ohio than ohio itself
do you want to read my emails for me
i like keeping my emails unread because it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bother me but it bothers everyone else
and your emails will never be as legendary as mine, where Dr. David Kazdan, MD, PHD, PE, tried to figure out the definition of "Janky" and discovered it on Urban Dictionary
adam wtf
adam wtf
Happened
adam wtf
I simply don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read my emails
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotten that many emails

i don't have notifications on for the gmail app
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wrong with that

the thing when u open my phone
and i want it to be a picture of myself in case i lose it
I am class of 2026
Oh shit
Damn
but what if first.last was taken
ah I see what you mean. it ended up just asking me for my portal password
My high school gave us unlimited gdrive and it's still there on our alumni accounts soooo...
I think it's just more general and isn't a Case thing
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve set it up but I might have
Yeah, this is what I forgot
Oh fuck, the link I sent you is the wrong one
Not the password change, my bad lol
all these log ins are a pain in the ass
so that it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spread around as gossip bc ppl only read the headline :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed:
Except Case sometimes blocks the DHT so you gotta get a private tracker
dont do it on case wifi
casewireless02.cwru.edu has someone downloading a lot of ||Chinese pornography|| on iknowwhatyoudownload.com
who the fuck downloads that stuff anymore
it was you wasn't it
Why in the fuck would I torrent on *wifi*
not if ur broke
idk
has anyone ever died on campus
damn wyg
wtf
Grad student was mad at his professor
Wait, no. Grad student was mad at the computer lab administrator, accusing him of deleting his work
damn
stay away from all grad students
stay away from all students ideally
you cant stop me now
business majors when they have to color INSIDE the lines for their final exam
@rsgsockcheck how come you don't respond to my dms
limit discussion on this bc it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna be hard to moderate just wanted to get the article out
rip people who live in red states
hey so this article is wrong
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just an article nothing has been voted on or passed yet
oh so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not completely set in stone yet?
dw please it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not passed yet it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a draft
what I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get is that like 60% of people think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s essential
idk tennessee thinks that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll happen
clearly civil rights aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a huge priority
yeah no never going to happen
let alone roe üëÄ
The funny thing is, ACB doesn't think she's a puppet
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sad
all the radical ideologies are going to die out with the older generation
Why would they even draft such a thing before the midterms tho
because they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very smart
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been working on this since like December I think? According to the article
maybe it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a 4d chess move and the justices actually secretly don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like republicans and they want to maneuver themselves out of political control
It could be a rallying cry for evangelicals, who vote in large numbers
unfortunately it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also gonna be a rallying cry for women
they forgot that young ppl actually vote now
But the pro-choice republicans still vote Republican, and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that the Dems will get a wipeout because of this.
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my prediction from a month or two ago, but the dems haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recuperated much since. I could see this flipping NV AZ GA PA and maybe WI if the Dems are able to capitalize on it (but considering how bad they are at actually campaigning, idk)
The blank ones don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have senate elections coming up
mississippi sorry ahaha
oh gotcha
I don't think joe biden can even remember where he is let alone cane someone
didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop andrew jackson
poor kids are just as smart as white kids!!!!
there was a rep who caned a man but Andrew Jackson caned someone when he was a judge or whatever
wow damn
jackson beat someone up for trying to assassinate him
no jackson like dragged someone out of court and beat them with a stick and then went back to being in court I think
roosevelt MOCKED the dude who tried to shoot him for being bad at it
How did 50 pages fit inside his pocket
I feel like its more of a testament of 1800s guns sucking tbf but still super badass
I mean 1800s guns literally would kill you even if you got shot in the finger so
Just wanted to add to the obergefell discussion, even though this wouldn't change the outcome of anything, that there have been polls recently that the majority of republican pty accept LGBT.  Most people against LGBT are evangelicals, I think the other Republicans take a more libertarian stance toward lgbt.
the late 1800s and early 1900s were just a bunch of crazy people doing insane shit
did I guess it
unfortunately, penis is not a country.
I wish
if that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a real place why were ppl always telling me about it
in middle school
If you don't get that one I'm *concerned*
Huh.  Never took the Brazilians for colonizers
I wanted to do study abroad in spain for a couple weeks but covid shut everything down
i feel kinda nasty after bootlicking Alito so i just want to say that I'm pro-choice and I think Alito is sweaty and old
anyone know where I can find a cart for moving out?

I have a few on a server with 12k people and nothing catastrophic has happened yet
Fuck it I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m even for late term abortions
You ever sit next to a crying baby on an airplane
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think ppl should be allowed to live until they turn 15
idk I left it blank
How exactly does express checkout work?
When does KSL close?
Cant argue with that
Wtf happened in tink

@_s.k Please don't post that image. There are some people who are uncomfortable with posting themselves online solely due to their skin color and the fear that they will be harassed for it. I appreciate if you took this down so we can be more inclusive of POC.

World√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s shittiest fucking airport
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t store my bags and leave because they charge $25 dollars per bag
There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no fucking food
And there aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t any seats anywhere
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even sit down
Idrk where to say this but I just wanted to thank you all for everything. Ik the school year just ended, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only been one sem for me. I just realized how much this server has helped me literally all the way back to this earlier september when I was still in the island and had no idea how ohio√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna be like (ifykyk). Because of you guys, moving in and my overall first sem of college became so much better than what I initially expected. Instead of being that one lost kid in college, I knew where I needed to go and what I needed to do because of y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all. From the stupid little questions to the very in-depth complicated ones, y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all were always there to helppp, and I appreciate that sm. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so random and cringe or wtvr, but yeah I love y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all and I just wanted to wish y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all a happy summer break and also advance happy mother√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s day to y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s amazing mothers, take care üôèüèº√¢¬§√Ø¬∏

kindly fuck off cuz you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re wrong
as someone from nj/ny that has been to all 3, lga is objectively the worst one. it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a complete and utter shit show. any airport is, but especially lga
Republic is the best airport in NYü•∞
It is pretty sad that nyc has the worst major airport in the country.  There were security checkpoint lines that were so long they were outside.
just drive instead ü•∞
France airport is worse
france has only one airport. obviously

Upset?
on one hand I did really well on my finals but on the other hand I have covid
On one hand I got an A on my final, on the other my prof said he won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t round my 88.2 to an A
That's sad
Are those SAGES classes decent cuz I've got a history of disliking English.
Find a topic that interests you and it should be
i hate english and i love my sages
I hate sages I love English
Idk maybe I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just built different
I genuinely don't know how they could make it worse than English but I remain hopeful
Oh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t gate the content I just hate the whole system
Like the credit literally cannot transfer to a shit ton of colleges
I have a conspiracy theory that sages is designed to keep you from transferring since the credits can't be transferred over
Professors who don't round 89% and up to an A should seriously rethink their careers
no i think the human race should die off
Mouthbreathing the Californian air has finally caught up to me as now I have the most insufferable sore throat known to man
Also b4 anyone says covid, I literally did the PCR test where they stick a long ass cotton swab up my nose for a very uncomfortable 5 seconds, and it came back negative
I had a sore throat and tested negative for covid, but the next day it was positive
well shit
what u have against californian air
But was it the stick up your nose test

People are already losing their life savings and shit
You know that buying into trends is step 1 on how to lose money?
My friend made hella money from gamestop last yr
you shouldn't be buying any other altcoin
Idk man
I bought $50 of LUNA for $0.0003 each and then sold at $0.0006
I doubled my money ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏
Could've gotten several K easily but I didn't wanna have a chance to lose my $50
It feels a little weird to buy someone's life savings at 10000x markdown
If we're honest, I don't even know if the people who sold me that LUNA are still walking on this earth
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just mad I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t 18 when GME and Doge were the craze
I got that 0.01 BTC from a guy that was a furry and had a massive fetish to be owned by someone... that also wrote custom GPU drivers to maximize hashrates on AMD GPUs and was a Bitcoin millionaire when Bitcoin was just $300. Do the math about what that makes him now...
Poor guy
Before it was about fucking ecoterrorism
If it makes you feel any better he made the service

i just got yelled at by my court advisor for something someone else did
i too want to disappear
i fell off a log today
I think you need some smelling salts
I think he needs a covid test
I think I need an undertaker
I'm awake
Train networks are hard jesus christ
personally i think stickers are the worst decision discord made
So it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not all bad
I feel kind of bad for my friend cuz his brother (one that sent me this) basically got Alex Jones and Joe Rogan pilled
Oh no
2 bedroom apartment for 2 people, guess didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get screwed afterall
Damn he pointing the gun at everyone
It feels like 2019 was a year ago
I don't believe it
southside > northside tho
i want to live close to the quad + where my friends are
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t your friends live in north side too?
The first point is fair. But you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll soon realise SS sucks
why does ss suck
And most of the events happen near NS so you gotta walk
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care how small the room is as long as it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s My room and No one else√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s
like i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to live on southside as a freshman
I'm in STJ I won't
lmao fair. i never had to share a room with anyone so i wouldn't know the struggle
I mean true but also I don't have that many friends
I caught an enormous bullfrog today
kinda boring here yk
Why is Wyany closed but Veale still open
I hate walking
I just went to Wyant, it said closed, so I just did some body weights stuff at the field, talked to a dude in your year and he told me Veale still open so
Finna go there starting tmrw
girl idk
oh it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s closed on weekends
not yet i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m leaving a week from today
It was an IB school so it had a shit ton of international students
rich ppl shit
Damn
Who wants to help me kidnap him for ransom
We split 60-40 cuz it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my idea
I went to an IB school that cost $74k for the two years, but almost no one paid anywhere near that amount (I think, I certainly didn't.) The dorms were nicer than Case, yet they were also not gold-plated or anything. I kinda miss them
I wouldn't wanna live in the fanciest ass dorms there are because it'd probably cost more than I'll make in my lifetime, *and* get old really fast
Damn it takes a special kind of fuck you from God to go to your grandpa's funeral and end up getting covid from it
I'm sorry for your loss and hope you get better soon
The plum cook doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even wear gloves handling your foodüò≠
never have
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
literally 99% of chefs don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear gloves
Anyone else feels incredibly underachieved for their age
I did, until I realized that I've also been unmedicated for the past year.
damn
@.littlejimmy yeah I need to be like livvy dunne rn bruh
Kill me
Oh no :((
Oh my leg√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all cramped up it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s physical pain this time üòÇ
Bruh the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìarches√¢‚Ç¨ of my feet have been cramping up lately
Quotes because my feet are flat so I have no arch but that area is cramping for I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what reason
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been mostly in bed since school ended
and i won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel guilty for being awake ü•∏
Research and another job
And mcat studying if I find the motivation
Saving money>>
On campus is stupid expensive and for what
Bro I miss herüò≠
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tacky to miss your ex in 2022
idk
I miss her üò≠ but also I hate her üò≠
Tf wrong w me
you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss her you miss being in a relationship
just kill her
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re down so bad i can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help you
How am I down bad
I just in my feels
Sorry gonna go cry in the quad now
Oh wait it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s closed
And ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t no way she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s paying
Cuz I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on linkedin every single day
wait no its kinda sad
Maybe this is why your Florida girlfriend doesn't want you anymore.
Ouch üíÄ
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t for international
Is that what u wanted
I shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be
And beyond the last 90 days
Cuz I know they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll get notified
Oh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on private mode
So they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll never know it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s meüòé
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use it enough for me to do that
Fair enough
Because f that shit
Linkedin isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t social media üó£üó£üó£
Just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t engage w their online presence
My first navigator left at the end of my first year. My second navigator assured me she'd help me until graduation. She left after about a year. Now i have a third navigator
Ayo it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel right to judge people by their social media
Not all Jenns are created equal, Jen in the music department never even replied to my 3 emails
damn....
i don't know what the diagnostic looks like
assuming it covers basic calc but prob more idk
if youre not stem, it doesnt really matter
no it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
you only need 30/50 to place into calc 1
AIN'T NO WAY THAT TWITTER BELONGS TO A NAVIGATOR
You've got me scared now
Oh true because isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t math 120 pre Calc?
I hate the hex dumbbells at veale
Case is pretty when all the trees have leaves and aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t dead
Campus with dead trees is also nice for some reason
i dont know about you but personally i wouldnt have that
nah I want all the smoke üëø
lmao what is wrong with my discord
true but then again, if I go thru those lengths to look up someone
i mean i do that to figure out what they have achieved and also how to build my own linkedin 
dont want them to know i look up to them
oh I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use LinkedIn enough to do that
a month and a half ago dawg
I just realized I have the midwest role
Damn straight, it sure is *ass*
Didn't u ask for me to attest if u r an incel or not?
fuck him
No school
My fault G I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even see that :nkoLost:
Only thing i cheat on are exams
You didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it?
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the email
won't make a difference
my caseid is hrs75
You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to care
I feel sad every time a tree is cut down :((
Unless it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dying
why do we need another roadüôÑ
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cut trees
They need a road, if they wanted to build a bigger building they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll say so
We're not gonna suddenly suffocate just because 9 trees are cut down
Well life won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get easier because they slapped some asphalt down for us to walk on either
Yeah that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be a toughie, also if you mess with the roots it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s likely they will die
Also is it guaranteed that whoever will move them would do it right? The trees might die
So moving is really not a feasible option altogether
it costs so much money
The point is, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remove the trees!
Removing trees is bad
Which they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Your point is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwho the fuck cares√¢‚Ç¨üò≠
Our greed to expand our industry and infrastructure has lead to the mother earths impending death!!!!
if they really wanted to help students they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d make the target express run more often
They enrolled 1800 students this year which is probably their highest class size till date
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a damn shame
This school i stg
Still something. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna make a difference man they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re big trees
Never been to campus but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d prefer greens
9 baby trees aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bad. 9 big old trees are. You need to contextualize numbers always
Yeah I heard 
They removed housing guarantee for juniors and seniors
Idk if they walked back on that or nah
Omg
They said they had extra rooms on southside I think? I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about a new dorm though
Shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t universities be MORE selective to look more idk√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ elite? I know that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not great but what is cases objective here
The answer: moola? Idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s moola but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always money
I guess more students=more money
Damn what
Jealous
I was in triangle for quarantine housing and it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t half bad
Triangle has mice I know someone who had one show up in his drawer
And it needs to stop spamming emails
But it was nice to have a whole apartment to myself when I was legit dying of Covid
Sorry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m craccheaded today
My head is still in the previous topic
The world has been infuriating me for a while so I will get mad over anything big or small that ruins it further
I did luck out but my conditions were terrible so it was a unfortunate experience for me anyway
Dang I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry :(
Bro I ended up I the emergency roomüò≠
apartments near the village
The one near plum?
Oh
Covid sucks ass
I went there for quarantine last year and there were ants
Especially if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a week before finalsüò≠
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worn a mask in so long
Other than being on a plane
Also I have some Covid immunity because I got hit right before finals
I think i got the rona like 3 weeks ago?
Finally ended tho
Bro it was so bad I was vomiting left and right
I was dying for 3 days
Oh godddd
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wear a mask at work because no one does üò≠ i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want them to think i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m weird i hate  the peer pressure
I had covid a few weeks ago and besides some really bad chills at first it was mostly smooth sailing
I still wear masks on public transport
~~Covid made me horny as fuck for a week~~
sucks :(
Mine has been really like strep throat, lots of sore throat and tons of congestion
shit get well soon!
Well I kind of dodged ot during school because I was an early Vax and early boost, so mine ran out
I went to a funeral and got it there :/
oh man that sucks, are you feeling better than you were initially
except theres no closet in my room but thats ok cuz i actually have 2 rooms
at least i dont have a roommate
not that bad
I keep trying to explain to my parents that since I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m used to walking around Cleveland my myself I should probably be fine in ny by myself
unfortunately I also have a ton of stalkers that will be at that event too so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m kind of fucked lmao
unfortunately I spent way too much time on their discord server and now I have a bunch of people trying to figure out information about me
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fine the stalkers are just bored kids
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t die then
I might die of cringe if anyone recognizes me from there
Oh I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in ny lol I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m driving back today
I have friends I wanted to meet up w in ny but my parents wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let me take the train
New York has a greater sample of randomness that is unique to it alone
Idk how but rn Clev is hotter than Florida
Damn blue note
I hate the game now
but I can't stop playing it
I don't like the grapple changes
I have close to 1500 hours on for honor
hate it more than overwatch
idk how the game actually plays tho
there are good builds and bad builds but ultimately it collapses down to 1-2 viable builds
holy shit I was sitting so close to Anderson paak at a blue note concert
Why are cemeteries closed at nights
people do weird shit in cemeteries at night
Cuz that is based asf
you dont need to buy textbooks
Don't do that unless you're terrible at chem
Also I submitted my medical school applications yesterday and that shit hurted for my wallet
best wishes!
This dude spent $4500 so far

No idea but he said it was like a shitty little island so i dont think so
Dude I went to cook lunch today and someone stole our spatula and cutting board üò≠
why do you need it
Holy shit I got interviewed by a guy from the New Yorker earlier tonight
never reached out ofc
but i just wanted to see
the guy i matched w didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reach out either so i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel bad
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know there was a √¢‚Ç¨Àú26
i still do that
all he says is: should i punch you that hard and i whimper and take my leave
Oh shit
why is jolly closed
Every time I try ordering sumn it says closed
They don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like Asians
Damn bro weakest link fr

Too sleepy to explain
Unpaid is fine w me cuz I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to sign like 100 pages of paper work cuz international ü§™

But also you work directly with clientele
Of class & internship
Still gotta go network cuz Finance bros have it hard unlike the stem kids üòî√¢≈ì≈†üèº
Class of 2024 lucky doe
ai is scary sometimes
it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make much sense of course but neither do most of my messages
the wrong fucking picture
^ virus don't open
üò± oh no
DAMN
idk why it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t working
my dad sent me the original file so I guess he is a criminal and I will have to report him to the internet police
HOW ARE YOU GETTING IT TO WORK
i keep getting √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtoo much traffic √¢‚Ç¨≈ì
oh nvm
GPT-3 doesn't have info past 2019
what the fuck
that whole lambda thing is screwing so much with my head
yeah and don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me wrong I know its not sentient but the messages it sent creep me out a lot
But yeah, it seems to respond a little too humanly for my taste
Other AI have passed that test before
Jeez that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s scary
Don't people just read the titles and think they know everything about the topic?
If anyone knows any ranches that needs ranch hands for summers
No but I do like working on a farm
oh no
genuinely there is a real ranch i know of but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a) in California and b) impossible for me to find anything about getting a job there on the internet
damn thats not very w of arnold
Pain
Nah don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pray for him mf√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s home with AC I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m at Case with a shitty fan
Even with my AC on full blast, cranked as low as possible with the fans as fast as possible, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still uncomfortably hot when I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m driving to my internships lol
Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like 30-45 min away, depending on what is being done tbh
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m the drippiest one though
i found a dress but it was giving christmas eve so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it
I need to go thrifting again soon tbh. Last time I went was during winter break iirc
i have a love hate relationship with avalon exchange
Even though I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it directly lol
i got a free people skirt from avalon but the only con is that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ugly as fuck
i think i also saw a free people dress when i was thrifting on monday but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bother because it was ugly
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve actually never heard of that store before
Looked it up though, seems like there is one in Pittsburgh, but none near me
spring 2002 üò≠ can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get rid of it
My great uncle likes to give away his old clothes from the 70s, which he bought so much of, and he had pretty solid fashion sense, so a lot of it is actually quality stuff. I got a coat from him that I brought to Case bc it was very warm and I really liked it, but unfortunately a few of the buttons fell off bc i wore it a lot lol.
I still have the buttons, just need to sew them back on
when clothes were made to last >>>>>
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pretty sad that honestly nothing is made to last anymore.
Do you roll down the windows when you first get in the car? Gotta let out the hot air first
drive for a bit while the wind circulates the air
every time we would get in his car it would be hot as shit so he just blasted the fans with the windows down for a few mins
But she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell me why she did it
Arnold is back again this time he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s downstairs instead of in my room
omg
And all they said was sorry. Like damn bitch give me a $5 google play gift card or sumn
nothing bro üíÄ
So waste of money rip
Nah you mad sue
Since them stem majors can't hygiene, case is hiring some professionals
Solving Rubik√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cubes is hard when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all one color
who here knows calculus i suck at it and i hate it and i need help
if anyones thirsty for a PE credit theres one open for tennis first half but I have another class at that time so I can't take it
Need help on sumn
WTF üíÄ
this is without financial aid right?
This was from a friend, i didnt get my offer yet tho
how is it 22k tho wutüíÄ
oh damn
bc it doesnt match the raw price of mine at all
what the fuck
but i coulda sworn someone sent a screenshot saying the total cost without any aid is 81k
mine says $78k
last year it was roughly 73k for me
Wasn't it like the increase won't be as high for returning students compared to freshmen
i prob won't find it
damn
If they increased it to 91k I would fasho transfer like god damn üíÄ
ik an international who transferred to another school cuz of cost
Same altho I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t transfer now
yeah so now she's only gonna pay OOS tuition which isn't bad
unless it's a UC school
I was contemplating transferring there tbh but then I feel like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already invested too much at Case to transfer
funny how im supposed to be asleep
So early???
Damn
damn indeed
and ended up getting out of bed at 6
which was late
we love being alone with toxic thoughts!
And you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know it
this hit too hard my chest now hurts
oh perf im taking stat 312R this fall
Damn
Oh üíÄüíÄ
Idk I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to take econometrics üòπüëéüèº
A guy ik told me finance bros can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do simple calculus
I mean I could but since I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just trynna forget about it to make room for stuff
I forgot how to do integrals like the minute I graduated high school
i just remembered that someone said econometrics isn't bad cuz it's business majors who are taking it too and they're not engineering
Well yeah they ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wrong
so it's not actually hard then?
MY INTERNET
i won't take it lightly
fuck spectrum wifi oml
Fuck spectrum ong
I mean I heard the professor is really approachable
all my homies hate spectrum
idk
There was a math teacher at my hs that apparently quit after making a fortune from stocks
Even private school teachers don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hav that good of a salary
Half of my hs teacher leave
We actually ran out of econ teachers and had to get a history teacher to teach IB econ üíÄüíÄüíÄ
dunno where he is now
Yeah shit was unreal
My favorite history teacher left tooüòû
Shit was mad chill I was like one of her favorite students
Now I want one
Fall admits r 83k without aid so
Omg same
oh my god I had a stress dream where this New Yorker article I was interviewed for a few weeks ago came out and the reporter spent most of it roasting me for not answering his phone calls
it is for people that dont have another hobby, therefore making it a hobby
Any hobby that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not mine is cringe and fake, sorry that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just how it works
Sorry I can't afford a plane
i mean its a pvt college
NYU gave 100k+ COA for someone
like my scholarship literally decreases in value every year even tho it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the same monetary amount
I would never invest that much annually for an undergrad education
NYU is generally considered to be one of the worst schools (if not the worst) in terms of the amount of debt burden its students have
I've a friend that said his tuition totaled like 110k last year
Maybe if you have a really short attention attention, it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean that everyone else can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t chill and vibe to music
@ambitiouslearner 8 weeks
5head moment

They want you to pay more money
Bruh I tried to waive my insurance but it got denied?
mfs really want me to pay ~3.5k a year for insurance??
mine got approved üíÄ l
or you clicked undergraduate and not med school
Maybe Case just doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want you to be here anymore
I pinched 2 nerves benching on monday, one on each hand
Every push day is shoulder day if you bench with bad enough form
Connamacher is celebrating 11 years at Case today (or yesterday, idk)
Ive been here 1 year and i cant stand it
I am no longer a mandated reporter ü•≥
All the shit I told you better be fucking TOP SECRET
there is a CIA officer who has a college rule notebook FILLED with intel on you
It was supposed to be a joke
yeah i realize it was supposed to be a joke i just sometimes respond to jokes way too literally and make the conversation stop being funny sorry
based and shit take
they're still students
stem students aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t real students
based and shit joke then idk
take it from the zaddy of bad jokes, that's a bad joke
there is a 8:30 one but I dont want am 8 am üòî
yea I saw those just worried my sages will end up then as I dont know which sages class I was assigned yet
I had a few sages options after 2 sadly

Is pavloving someone unethical?
Fair enough
Also fair enough
I wanted to ask you what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s it like
LAMIA WE HAVEN√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢T MET IN PERSON YET

1 cycle couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hurt
What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more fucked is almost killing yourself incline benching
If you're not natty idk who is
damn
I have respect for ppl who go thru cycles, cuz u still gotta work fuckin hard to get gains
Fake Natty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s are the worst
I want pizza
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think any of the showers provide you with soap and towels that seems unsanitary
Like last year
Just use the ones from last year
I fly da plane
i also forgot o have a hamster

and can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave them for a week lol
What the fuck are they trynna pull here
wtf!
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the USG treasury literally get busted laundering money @mag3is
Barnes and Noble can suck a fat one with marketing like this
Lol I'm not buying any fucking textbooks from them. Um just gonna download them from the internet
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually used a textbook since freshman year
No, and I can't believe I was worried that the myth of spending thousands on textbooks for college was real
you should see all the gussets stuck to his back
oh my god I forgot risk was the name of a tabletop game and I was like RISK OF WHAT????
How the fuck did the neanderthals and homo habilis and everything from before figure mate like it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so weird when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re kinda human but not really and there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s some sort of society but not really
neanderthals managed to breed into the population bc humanity has always had monster fuckers and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a trait we will never lose
im saying hes the product of monster fucking
And I understand why the gods were so horny all the fucking time
im not gonna judge u for wanting to fuck monsters but i am gonna judge u for wanting to fuck greek monsters specifically
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re telling me you wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fuck a gorgon?
u wanna fuck that monster in particular
that one. right there? her? in the photo. wanna fuck that one?
i wanna fuck grendel's mom from beowulf who according to this wikipedia article i literally just read is either an ape or a valkyrie depending on who you ask
it's like fucking a 50/50
wear a blindfold and she's both at the same time!!!! but i wouldnt want to do that i think i would probably want to know
AND her son is dead so no child baggage
I wanna fuck grendel
conversation isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a requirement
oh man we watched the beowulf movie in english class in high school and so true
Damn
So we all had the same hs english class experience?
They might have to be a case student but I forgot
god I fucking hate flies
Who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t
Tried to snipe one with my belt
Missed

I guess get some groceries and make it work?
Fair
I can survive without food for 3 days üòî√¢≈ì≈í√Ø¬∏
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll probably just spend an extra three days with my parents at least they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll still be in town
Tsa spent hella long staring at my bag in the xray
The STJ shower head is as tall as my nose
pain
Aren't you supposed to remove laptops and stuff from your bag to avoid them staring at it for hours?
Holy shit
Fuck*
21 hours
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m moving in in 21 hours
oh shit where
@kaori_flute i miss u :david_stop:
i was just like damn i really wanna hug jenin rn
i miss u sm hannah
I really need a hug rn
at least i dont need to shower sitting down
If you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re an RA, OL, or volunteer with move-in you can move in early. I think varsity athletes can sometimes move in early too but don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t quote me on that.
they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re letting me move in early since my sisters a freshman and my parents don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to make the 8 hour drive twice
yknow as someone who has been living on southside for 3 hours
Except for the dead bunny
That was sad
STJ has mad hotel vibes
The little ones where the get stuck and die
Only 5 minutes away
It's really weird how my dad tells me he misses me
without saying a word
üíÄI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have old pics of myself
not excited to leave home tho
im honestly just glad im at the bottom of the hill. if i had to go up and down the stairs every day with the state that my knee and hip joints are in i dont think i would be able to make it back to my room some days
you would just find me crying at the base of the stairs, curled in a ball like a dickensian orphan
really what we need is a zip line from one end of campus to the other
the stairs are not that bad after a few times
now that we are getting back to school how was everybody's summer
@.littlejimmy i have yet to see you since moving in
Life is pain
lots of work
Moving in when

Oh gotcha
Well to be fair I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the 2025 server
hopefully it wont be raining when i have to meet them because i dont want to have to corral them into fucking olin
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know I feel like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never had this happen before and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been helping with move in for years
sometimes I will almost google something like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhere did I leave my jacket√¢‚Ç¨ and then I remember that google doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work like that and get angry
Isnt this?
but I dont think it is because of this
"I just don't want to move because I have my fish set up in here and I signed up for the room first. She signed up to live in the room knowing 2 other people would be here."

tbf prisoners need room to do push-ups and shit and case students are vegetative by nature
we dont have a formal def for veggies

I feel like mushrooms would always win 20 questions bc they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in any of the three categories
honestly kind of a bad point investment if you decided not to be small and became big instead
but you see, i lived there last year, I know how it looks
and that doesnt change the fact that it is smaller than us regulation prison cells
they really said sit alone with ur thoughts for 3 hours and 15 minutes

I need heat safe glue and paint though so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t end up drinking poison when I put hot tea in it
I know someone who broke a glass dish and hot glued it back together, then proceeded to bake a casserole in the oven with it
You can imagine how that went
lame loser
i dont like that tippit is noisier now i would appreciate it if people simply stopped moving in
@buzzmas and I keep leaving our rooms at alternating times and missing each other and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s extremely funny to me
the chairs folding backwards if you distribute your weight wrong is a little bit terrifying

i hate how people can tell i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on my way to casino night it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s embarrassing
Don't go to casino night @ambitiouslearner
After u arrive u gonna realize it's too many ppl in the line and it's dead
i just want to go early so i can GO
cuz i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go last yr we just waited in line for 20 minutes then dipped
the fact that i have to wear my OL lanyard sucks
But there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing to do on campus lol
I have heard it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s boring tbh from some students√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
smh why aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they encouraging 18-22 year olds to develop a gambling habit before they become fully financially independent
isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the point of college to put us into debt ???
Yah, but making us broke through casino night would be too obvious lol
I am so alone now

Guys, I don't know if anyone can answer this but I have a UofH interview tomorrow morning and the volunteering position requires: 1) a TB test 2) a T-spot blood draw and 3) a Quantiferon blood draw. I reached out to the individual responsible for orientation and I was told that I need to get this done before the the orientation on Thursday, September 8th and it needs to be through Case Western. Should I go to *health services,* or where would you guys recommend getting this done? Thanks in advance!
I didn't even have to do that for for my UH research
Yeah, apparently if I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it done by orientation next Thursday, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the position lol
They told me UofH won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t provide me with the tests and that I have to get it done through Case Western üò¨

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure my sages prof last year didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even make me go to the convocation
yeah it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t required of me so i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to go because of my class
Oh that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rough. I got mine for research credentialing

me out of the kindness of my heart taking a job at fribs
but in total i feel like everyone would get their packages faster
still wondering wtf happens if you lock yourself out of your room after noon if you live on southside
Contact your RA I guess?
probably you would contact your RA like if nothing else they can like let you sleep on the couch instead of on the hard cold floor
that would be so sad if that happened
What if you locked your phone in too?
I know someone who got locked out at 5 am and the RA on call got her back in
If you lock your phone in I guess you gotta find someone else who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still up lol
but RA on call hours do not start immediately after fribs closes i dont think
bc fribs is only open until noon
last night fribs was open pretty late
oh
I thought it closed at midnight
i have still never been into fribley
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live on south side
oh
and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have classes on south side
idk man friebly pizza is wack
shi the pickle pepper pizza last year
made me dead
one time before o week i panicked bc i locked myself out and i wasnt sure if RA on call existed yet but luckily it did
ive only locked myself out twice more since
and now i just leave my room door open and bolt it so it doesnt close
i kept my room open back in michaelson
the suite door would be closed but id just leave my actual door open
yeah its in my suitemate agreement to keep suite door closed so i just keep my door open when im not in the room
Sri doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that luckily
Masteringchem aint too bad just yet but dam bro a tiny mistake üòîüòîüòî
omg you have to kiss
I joined the BIOL216 class late, so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not on the mailing list for the SI sessions
Exams scary
I think the exams aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t too bad compared to Bader√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 214 exams lol
idk bro theres 0 chances this is true
dude same, im so lost
ochem always kind of looks like someone spilled the letters bag and all the letters fell out
bruh dude i put isobutyl on the left and isopropyl on the right initially
and it was wrong
I will never understand chemistry I simply won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be able to do it
but the website makes too much money to fix it ig
I miss when I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to learn things
oh to be 5 again
wow i miss being in 2nd grade
oh to be 3 again
at age 3 I feel like I was falling over all the time
one time when i was three i fell asleep with snacks in the pocket of my hoodie and when i woke up my parents had taken the snacks out of my hoodie pocket and i was so mad
2-methylpropyl is the same thing as isobutyl this is wrong af
isopropyl is 1-methylethyl
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like straightforward compared to Bader√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s exams
Like Bader would throw material he never covered on the exams while the 216 Professor is relatively straightforward in what she expects from us
Like the exam is content we covered in class and as long as we study that, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re perfectly fine
I didn't take Haywood's class so I have no idea how 216 is in relation to 215
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do as well as I liked so ignore everything I said lol
i have literally never gotten a worse grade in my life
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alright, the first exam is usually hard
I forgot you were in 323
The favorite part of my day was how I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t check my bio grade until an hour after class ended because Canvas was down lol
i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to check in class so i went to check after and NOPE
idk if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re saying favorite ironically but that was the universe giving me a moment of peace before bestowing upon me the worst grade i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever gotten
idk in my opinion 216√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s content is easier to grasp than 215√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s but the exams are so much less straightforward and it feels like she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s trying to trick us on every question @ambitiouslearner
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair
I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take 215 so maybe that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand your perspective tbh
Bader√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s exams are basically like Kuemerle exams except she actually covers the content lol
Try taking her practice exams
Yeah I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t comprehend anything in 215
0% chance rain my ass
What rain?
THE RAIN
Sorry I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see anything
It's not currently raining, but at 1:45 it was
I had lab from 1 to 4 today so I missed it lol
Bruh you got an A on the exam

i think ur right tho
I WAS SO FUCKING CLOOOOSE
I studied the lecture vids and notes for over 24 hours total. If I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get an A thats on the test man üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ

except that one girl who yells at people out of windows idk what her deal is :david_stop:

You all are hearing the loud booms, right? I'm not getting exploding head syndrome?
if it happens a third time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna lose it. the fact that it even happened a second time was unpleasant
It needs to get louder
i only just started trying to connect now one and a half hours later but yes
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s working on my ipad and my suitemates are able to connect
well then what the shit
but someone else just just told me it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t working for them
My wifi is gone too
There's no solution for it, sadly
Every time a fire alarm goes off, if you think the one in the dorm is scary, you should hear the one in dispatch
It's loud as shit here
it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make me want to draw my ears out which it usually does when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re standing in the hallway
i heard it in tippit and was scared it was tippit
I mean don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me wrong it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still very loud
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry :(
want me to kiss it better

I do not understand why it is necessary to run a drill in alumni though
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cold outside >:/
That and calling it anti-Semitic is what really pissed me off
B/c I want to read it
yeah me when condemning the actions of a nation means i hate the entire group of people of which the leadership of that nation is a very small part
it's like saying that it's racist against all chinese people to say that the ccp shouldnt be killing uyghurs
the bill doesnt even ask the school to like
that isnt saying "palestinians and israels can never cooperate and get along." it is saying "israel should probably stop bombing palestine and we should stop tacitly supporting them bombing palestine"
it doesnt say anything about judaism at all also
yes but, critism of israel/zoinism has been used as a form of veiled ainti-semitism. Tho I dont think this is the case with the resolution
if people assume that any criticism levelled against israel comes only from a place of antisemitism then that means that israel could get away with war crimes or such as
it mostly seems like they didnt actually read the document all the way through before condemning it
sorry im talking about this a lot more than i actually even wanted to in this server
if they released a statement saying "no we arent going to do that" and it was on the basis of the things the document actually says
i would still disagree
but i would at least be like well it's too bad that you feel that way
but instead they said "no we arent going to do that" in a way that makes it seem like they didnt bother to pay attention
sorry that im getting like
i want to make it clear that people here are totally allowed to disagree with me or disagree with the bill
just disagree with it for the right reasons. have the respect for other people's opinions to actually interact with what theyre saying instead of dismissing them out of hand
anyway im gonna go back to posting single jokes once every 4 days now sorry this is the most that has been seen of me for a while
the damn thing literally knows what the professor is talking abt to say before he says it
wtf
this is so sick
Damn it's really coming now
You can't have an IP address in your name and then not have anything there
Sorry, I haven't updated it with my new address
No, it's not publicly routable for people to be able to do anything to the address in particular
TAs who take points off of problems but don't explain why deserve their own special hell.
Sorry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m stalking but they (admin) associate judaism with Zionism. Big misconception and extremely hateful and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reflect what most of us believe
like "you should not bomb civilians" shouldn't be a political stance
no it shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be
yeah i mean on a personal basis i would find it a little wishy washy if someone was like "i am a zionist but i think it should be peaceful" history has demonstrated that to be unrealistic
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just hard and it makes us all question our faith in humanity lol. Most of the ppl here won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t change bc the US is so connected to Israel
And what bothers me is that people are saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìoh the Jewish donors are the ones pushing kalers hand√¢‚Ç¨
but with that email admin constructed a reality where the options are "War crimes are bad and also I hate jews" and "I love jews and war crimes committed by jewish people are always justified" and that's ridiculous. 99% of the debate exists in between those two options
it was a stupid email that demonstrated ignorance of the subject and also lack of respect for the student body
If kaler said √¢‚Ç¨≈ìguys I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna lose my job√¢‚Ç¨ it would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been more understandable
yeah i think what's really appalling about it is that they refused to actually interact with what the document said and instead kaler just called it antisemitic without evidence
not warprofiteering hurts their monthy bonuses
SLS launches in 30 minutes if anyone wants to watch
i am going home bc i need a mental health break √¢¬§√Ø¬∏  see my felines
There is a high pitched very loud beep in my room every like 20 seconds and idk where it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s coming from
It is going fucking haywire now
But there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no obvious way to make it shut up so now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m waiting for them to come fix itüò≠
if you start feeling a weight in your chest or thinking you are being haunted by ghosts
is anyone leaving for the airport at like 11am tomorrow and would like to ride the redline together xoxo
omg ur going home so early
Ion got a home to go back toü§£
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into discrete math for the second timeü§†
They never lifted my advising hold
My advisor better be dead cuz I emailed him 4 days ago and he didnt lift my hold @tsunderratedd
i couldnt get into chem 234 bc they didnt have 324 entered as a prereq
going to go cry now
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s annoying
cause im taking 328 anyway which i wasnt planning on doing
I might drop a class when it gets closer to the semester bc workload
slight issue i have five finals
somehow theyre all spaced out tho
and ik 202 and 324 are just the last exam during finals week so
@artemisdelelve 202 isnt really a final tho
also yeah sucks that it's late but at least we have time to prepare
and neither is my orgo class its just a test during finals
it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show up in the schedule planner or anything
exams
the exams are scheduled separately from the class time
could i potentially request permission for another class at that time
Hmm apparently it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called the provost exam block
Exams and Exam Logistics: There are four semester unit exams, held in person, each worth 50 points. The semester exams will be held during provost√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s exam block from on Fridays from 3.20 pm to 4.30 pm for a duration of 70 minutes on the days indicated on SIS as class meeting times on four Fridays. The exam dates are given here again for convenience:
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s weird that there are classes scheduled at that time if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called the exam block tho
If you're a chem major shouldn't you be taking 322
haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t decided if i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m majoring or minoring and if i do major it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be secondary and i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to so i would rather put more effort into my primary major #
i have chomped it to pieces and it is no longer in this plane of existence
oh sorry it must√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve slipped into my backpack on my way to the airport
i had a feeling no one would get it T.T
i hope that doesnt mean they stopped making my actual jeans
is there like a list of things taught per class? this doesnt really have information on actual things taught(unless im stupid and couldnt find it cuz i skimmed through the 25page document)
I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been attending class bc the prof is really bad at lecturing so I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how much is covered per class
the first doc has the schedule which says how many chapters are covered theoretically per week
i am really sorry to bother you again, but can you please send me "Online Notes for Physics 121 by Robert Brown (CWRU)"
i assume that what the chapters the syllabus talks about are in
I wanna prepare for the class especially if the reviews on rmp are accurate .-.
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all in separate documents by chapter so it would be a huge pain in the ads
pain in the ads üòî
ahh fair enough, dont bother then
tysm tho <3
is anyone going to the airport on the RTA early thursday morning?
pain in the ads
Pain in the ads
if u can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find anyone to go with just sit at the front no one bothers you
Unfortunately for you, I have an anti arson remote detonator wired up to yours
they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cook popcorn to save their lives
someone got smokers
oh
take away their popcorn
apparently this time it was an air frier

THAT'S why tippit doesnt exist anymore !!!!
i was wondering
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never letting you into my kitchen again
@addat yeah cry about it
he lowkey even looks like that lizard im ngl
Not to my nose or digestive system
i climb in there sometimes when i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m cold
youre making valley girls look sad and loser
cuz no one believes his southern claims
due to his cooking skills (or lack there of)
Howdy is right. You can't say I'm not from nebraska because nobody has ever met someone from nebraska
you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t prove he exists
I'm so lost
anyone who isnt in one of the mountain ranges is in deep shit when the reckoning comes and the seas overtake the lowlands
He calls anyone from the west coast a valley girl even though I am objectively not from the west coast
The more you say I'm from your homeland the worse I make you look so I'd reccomend just disowning me
you already have fake in your name which i think protects me from the worse of your damage to my honestly astounding image
everyone basically thinks im really impressive and being associated with you poses an enormous risk to my rep but that doesnt mean i dont want you to accept who you are and have a positive sense of self worth
he's never been given acceptance before so he is struggling to find words
fair
it's incredible how much internalized hatred so many people in the valley feel toward themselves
Fuck
holy shit hannah congratulations on becoming the president of christmas!!!!!
hannah isnt going to let the woke left tell her adam isnt a valley girl üò§
ok i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry
i hate women
lmk if u find it
he tried to bribe a baby bc he made her cry the other day
@addat am I wrong
oh that I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know
my dad doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know how his  own middle name is spelled
Fair enough
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s taken him 54, and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got it down yet
as long as someone remembers it, that's chill
I was likely standing to the left of this photo√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s frame
Fair but it is common
house 2 is like that except it's mostly drills
ive been in tippit for one drill and one actual alarm when someone burnt rice
@jujulb turns out adam just doesnt know what a maiden name is
When I found it and I showed it to them, I thought it was Cleveland, OH

Anyone going to the airport tomorrow early morning?
When you get to '00 you die
The cons are a bit worrisome and mostly what I thought. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll see if I can housing to move me but then again it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only for a sem. I somehow got a suite with half freshman and half sophomores: also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know any of them which is kind of rare. No clue who was here before and who transferred either. Just hoping it all works out.
what happens if i DO download a car
It clogs your internet connection and you have to call the internet police to turn yourself in and get it out üòî
you get to tell BMW to fuck off b/c having to pay a subscription for aleady installed features is BS
is anyone back in cleveland yet?
bc i kinda wanna come back now and some of my friends already are back
Aww

Its winter! I feel like I'm in a terrarium
Damn that's crazy STJ is so comfy
just to clarify i do not live in sigma psi however the heat is broken
I will not make it to the hotel the airport is too big it is simply too large to navigate
very sad
ayo @.bugcatcapoo what happened
AA booked me a connecting flight that closed boarding while my first flight was in taxi
also my current flight was delayed by an hour and a half their business practices are simply superb this week
i almost missed my connecting flight in charlotte with AA when i was coming home
never trust AA in charlotte
They have them sometimes, they just aren't connected / don't work
Charlotte Airport is a disaster
I had a 20-min layover at Charlotte airport one time and nearly missed my next flight because the walkway signs are so damn confusing üòÇ
Hope you got the issue resolved and caught a flight
the airport is def understaffed so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m less mad at them. they have a serious and very noticeable staff shortage
the people who book your flights when you buy tickets online are I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty sure not employees of the charlotte airport I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually most likely done by a machine that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t programmed very well
like it looks only at landing times without considering how long you spend on the runway and what time boarding closes and stuff
and it targets charlotte because it hates women !!!!!!!!!
yeah it turned my 1 hour layover into like 10 minutes
stupid robot
this is why AI needs to be stopped üò§
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what you mean by that hannah

that server√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s existence makes me feel so sad
When I'm a grumpy super-senior and I see the class of '30 I'll feel like I've already got one foot in the grave
oh my god i didnt even think about that
worst part of graduating late
shoutout to the elevator in rockefeller which takes 2 entire minutes to go up 4 floors
Shoutout to the elevator in the village√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Starbucks which got stuck for 20 minutes
Shoutout to the freight elevator in Glennan that takes so long to go down 8 floors that I can tell you about its entire history: how the Glennan building was used by NASA when testing rocket engines, how that meant they needed an elevator that had low acceleration and jerk to avoid the rocket fuel being jostled and combusting, and how they just never fixed it since then
I hate living in this building
Who owns barky dog?

YO WHAT THE FUCK
yes but they forgot to factor in that I automatically have all emails in my school account forwarded to my personal account where their attempt at deletion does not go.
I miss when this server was buzzing with activity
Go sleep bestie
Nah gotta get up at 5, ty for the concern tho ü•π
did anybody else just lose power for ~30 seconds or was that just my room

What happened to Lesley?
do not kill joe biden
ngl I was half expecting a news report that Biden was JFK'd
^ this isn't a joke
by the school?
apparently discord counts as social media
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kinda really funny but also it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really serious, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m serious you guys, no one do this
how did they find out tho
You gotta tell me what happened when you get back
I slept through half of the evening yesterday and woke up to cops asking if everything was okay
I really feel great about all this and not at all like a complete fucking doughnut
honestly what is wrong with me
oh dear
did you guys know they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even that secret, they tell you their names and everything
No way there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s enough death threats to the President for them to keep track of it
If they deem it as a serious threat they will pop up and talk to you
so going to DC and making these claims was deemed a serious threat due to the proximity to the White House
Even if biden wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in DC for the weekend, which is why the presidents personal schedule is never really released
I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually going to DC :crii: :crii: my flight was to Cleveland from Portland
obviously it was still a terrible idea I should NOT have done it
they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have my flight info or anything I had to give it to them
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s insane they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that
Biden wasn't even in DC on April first though, he was visiting UPenn's campus
I mean they knew I was on that plane from Chicago to Cleveland but they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that I hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t originally been on a flight to DC and got moved to a new flight that was stopping in Cleveland, or if I had another leg later or anything
I mean don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think I would get off the hook for being BAD at killing the president
I was telling one of my high school friends about what happened and he happens to be at UPenn and he was like "Biden was here"
someone here is a fed
they have been there for weeks now
I wish they would stop though shit is loud
"if you know your friends might go to hell, wouldn't you want to warn them too?"
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to get in more trouble bc someone tells the secret service that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m being anti-fed on social media :cursed_flushed: :cursed_flushed:
yeah it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fucked up that you haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been banned yet actually
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never even stepped foot in vermont
that would be impressive if I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that you can hover
he can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be trusted he claims he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the king of nebraska
just because he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s visiting you in rhode island doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean you are from there
ok hillary go off i guess
You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t trust anything he says
No I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say that
Hey if anyone wants to try yo grab a monroe 2 person apartment lmk I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m looking for a suitemate /apartmentmate as I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get a single. If we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get monroe (probably won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t) can go for whichever place gives us single rooms each.
Remember kids, freedom of speech protects your right to call someone an idiot/make fun of their political beliefs/etc **as long as you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t threaten them.**
I asked him why god didn't cure kids of cancer and he said that he could, but chooses not to
I wanna know how he feels about veggietales
So far, they've only been able to temporarily eject him on noise complaints
They can't even get him out on hate speech, so knock yourself out
Mans legit says he hates the gays ON THE RECORD and didn't face any consequences
But then we won't have free entertainment from him
The entire building reeked of weed and someone tried to convince the police that it was burnt popcorn.
I was getting food from Fribley when it happened so I walked over
why dont i go to yo mom
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to die next semester but that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s okay
if it's mechanics i can help yuou. if it's e&m i cannot i dont understand it
electrons... dont get them
i guess i just have incredible finesse and skill
theres a test tomorrow that i AM going to fail
really qualified for the major of my choice
im not switching to business they wont let me into pbl
me trying to explain to my major advisor that i want to do the parts of physics that are not particles. but also i want to do the particle stuff, but just not the particle stuff that isnt the interesting ones. and also i want to do material science but no chemistry
Me when I have 4 semesters to do 51 credits of work
hello professor berezovsky can i please not tkae this class?/ on the grounds that it sounds boring üëâ üëà
I have never taken a physics class in my life and I'd like to keep it that way
damn ill get you one of these days
how have you never taken physics
isnt it a requirement
not even in middle school you didnt learn F = ma
gravity doesn't exist
my high school required 3 years of science and i was told i wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get into college if i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take physics or chem so i did two years of physics and 1 year of chem
my sister has never taken calculus which throws me off
i also took bio but i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a choice in that
my school required physics then bio then chem and then you could do any or none of them senior year
bio was my worst grade in high school and yet i am a bio major
chem was my worst grade
my second worst one was physics 2 i think
im actually on track to fail my chem class this semester i might have to retake it
french isnt even a real language
stop making shit uo
you couldnt even tell me one french
and I had him last period french so I got to carry all the track equipment to the field
i dont speak french but in hs my advisory leader was the french teacher so im really good at saying "turn off your phones" and "stop doing homework" in a french accent
advisory was like this 45 minute thing we had to do every week where they would trap us in a room with a teacher and then make us talk about why bullying is bad and if you did homework he would beat you wqith a metal pole
my high school advisory teacher was also my freshman year english teacher and my other one (that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t my teacher, but the other one in the room) ended up being my junior history teacher who permanently altered my handwriting
Idk why I took 3 of the 4 hardest stem classes in hs and then decided "hm, I'm gonna keep doing this in college"
i think the difference between hs expectations of what college is like vs what college is actually like irl is very big and huege and people dont talk about it enough
tbf i did the same thing except in all of my classes
which is why im still a freshman even thoiugh i own the 2025 server
i came in after the forgiveness deadline though i have Ws on my record
Finance actually kinda hard tho but it's more interesting than chem
bio is hard and i hate it but i like neuro
i cant imagine two subjects harder and less interesting to me than finance and chem but i realize that's how 100% of all other people feel about physics so it balances out ultimately
I like archeology and paleontology but like damn they make 0 money
i havent done laundry in three months! üòÉ
the whole damn macy's?
well biochem. but i hate biochem
well i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hate biochem im just bad at it

@everyone does anyone who is still in cleveland have a iOLab device and components kit for physics labs that they're willing to resale? I need one urgently for phys 122 lab and im too lazy to order online
I think I may still have mine 

I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be back in Cleveland next week idk if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll still be on campus
I have the device but don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if I have all the components. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll let you know if I find them by tmrw
The craziest part is that all the wacky stuff started happening after most of the students left
Students who are still there: *welp*

Hf cleaning the hydroflask in that case
Yeah she left it in the sink
Knowing I get extremely antsy when things are left in the sink
arent those machine washable?
Why did I read that as chipotle supporting death penalty

Does anyone know how breadth requirements work for double majors
Aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the breadth same
Like you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to do more gened stuff
Right but like I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think 1 breadth counts towards both for double majors
Aw crap, it's late
Basically she wants you to prove that you put in the work and tried your best
she isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going to do that as she already adjust the boundary of the final grade
I may feel better if she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t adjust the cutoff
Cry more
I expected to get an A at the beginning of this class, but I did bad in the multiple choices
and there were 49 mcq in each exam√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
my gpa is still slay tho
me too rip chem dept 4.0
and they also told us not to call them for that stuff but we kept getting sent back to them from different offices and some people that answered the phone would help
they were like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re having a hard time getting through requests because of freshmen move in√¢‚Ç¨ but i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m like i think wasps in my room are more important than bed lofting requests
there are dead wasps in this photo
i had to call them yesterday bc my room blinds literally just came crashing down üò≠ they sent someone over like half an hour later
they just hate hannah
i HAD wasps theyre gone now
Oh whew
hannnah doesnt know this because she isnt clairaudient but actually every time her cat yawns he releases a powerful psychic scream
First the secret service and now the CCP... Who won't Annie get in trouble with
what the fuck does pk put in their aioli that shit got my breath stinking like a mf
those signs don't apply to you
as in if you have a meeting or if you have work
Cleveland caltholics say being gay is bad. Eric kale salad says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually okay at case
its cuz kaler is secretly a cle caltholic
He has to have written the Israel one though, there's no way a PR team would be like "yes, calling USG a hate group is a good idea"
if i squint i can almost see how that isnt racist to say.........,,,
COME BACK I MISS YOU BABS
dw, you also have the "What you didnt know about blacks in america revolution"
didnt they have some interim person replacing kaler or is that someone else
oh
I wish we had babs again
Wtf
6 months is so fast..........
so like, wtf are these two doing here
shouldnt they be in the deep south on their plantation
They have the money for it anyways
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still in denial regarding that
I mean it seems like she's at least trying not to be racist, and trying to think about the ways racism in the past has contributed to equality today
if i get in trouble again bc yall are talking shit about kaler im gonna personally come and find you
Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone through the blogs and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more she just has a white centric view lol. At most self-aggrandizing
yeah like the things she says that are racist are at least TRYING to be non racist theyre just missing the mark a little i think
Leave me be, I have so much negativity built up
We need an anarchist CWRU
she really aint helping herself with that title
I mean, I already had a bad feeling about Kaler's anti-union statement, and he CLEARLY has a BAD take on the Palestine situation from earlier this year
i dont even remember there being an anti union staement.........
I don't remember that either
it wasnt sent to students, only staff
omg
cuz there was an attempt to unionize
howdy for legal reasons i didnt just see you threaten damage to person or property
I don't think this is protected speech anymore
so its really our car
i'm broke, and tomatos are cheap when thy go bad
We know there are narks in this server because Annie got in trouble last year
you can tomato his car in minecraft i dont think he could object to that
i got in more trouble with the GOVERNMENT then you guys are likely to but the school policies still dont let you threaten other people
(the server allows you to kill people in minecraft)
Their dog is named adelbert√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT'S HER NAME :omegalul:
any of yall have resources for discrete math
my man fidalgo put 4 questions on the exam and only explained how to solve 1 of them
I miss fidalgo so much
If the exam isn't on monday, just go to him and ask what each problem will be on
yeah he will literally tell you exactly what you need to know for the exam
he did that for calc 3 anyway idk about discrete
Anyone here already took csds 391 by Lewicki?
anyone has any idea how exam 1 is
You are fucking cringe
They really be pulling triple shifts
It's not surprising by any stretch but it's still wild how this is an actual person and not some cartoon villain you know?
Oh? What happened for him to make sure his emails are not controversial?
He sent out an email last year calling USG antisemitic, and saying they support terrorism because they passed a resolution "condemning the continued illegal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank" 

And It made a lot of people mad because while the USG resolution certainly wasn't above criticism it was entirely a symbolic resolution and tried to be fairly safe and nuanced in its phrasing and the university president making very absolute inflammatory statements about an extremely complicated geopolitical situation and attacking the supposedly independent USG was just not a good look.

Particularly because he should have access to PR people who can read it and soften it to something much more reasonable before he sends out a mass email attacking a large segment of the student body
aw it's very rare one gets a "KILL ON SIGHT" for wildlife
the reason the gvt is asking people to kill these things is that allowing them to live will SERIOUSLY DEVASTATE local ecosystems and also crops and farms. they can do whatever they want in their native territory but if they continue to spread here they will fuck shit up extremely
even the most compassionate insect experts are asking people to kill these on sight because they have no predators in the United States and we have to do everything we can to keep them from spreading
there is a dead one inside the headlight of my car
still trying to figure out how it got there
might want to check for eggs then, cuz they like putting em on cars to they get taken places
that is a scary thought
I knew he couldn't hold it back
The lil Zionist rat bastard couldn't keep it to himself
Oh yeah I never noticed he said "Israel amd Gaza" in the first email. He didn't even say Palestine!
Oh, oh wow. This is even more vile than I previously thought.
Kaler decided the best time to send this email is when Israel cut food, water, electricity and soon Internet to Gaza, where there's children, and wounded people.
What the fuck?
What the absolute fuck is wrong with him?
Forget what I said about PR what in the absolute fuck is wrong with him?
No like I get that but if there's a time for fence sitting it is now. Like you're right he really should have shut the fuck up
Is this one of those "My PR team strongly advise me not to say this but they never said I couldn't email what I wanna say"?
Like I really don't have much expectations for these bureaucrat invertebrates but somehow they still find manage to find new and exciting ways to surprise me
my guess is people are a lot more comfortable being anti-Hamas, since they hit first
I suppose that since daddy Kaler have decided to jump off the fence for his lil investment shills, I don't have do put up w this either
Oh no but their spineless rhetorics will inspire Islamophobic attacks
I'm kinda of the opinion that students at case don't have the balls to be blatantly islamophobic
Oh but the adults will
that is true. but they also didn't have a choice there
I wouldn't be surprise if they let even more hate speech on campus
case for life isn't really hate speech, they're just wrong lol
pretty tame compared to some of the shit where I grew up
I gurantee if someone tried to start a KKK chapter at CWRU, that would get shut down real quick
"The scale of this terrorism is stunning, and therefore I will join with many in our community in a public denunciation of Hamas that will appear in this Sunday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Plain Dealer." 

he hasn't said anything about the IDF/IOF indiscriminately bombing civilians, ambulances, killing paramedics and journalists
its fucking disgusting
systematic oppression of minorities? redlining? rampant lead pollution causing an overwhelming 19% of children in east cleveland to have above the 5ug/deciliter limit imposed by the CDC, lowering average IQ (which is itself a racially biased metric) and increasing chances of heart and kidney problems in the future?
"I close with the wish that, in these most terrible of times, we find ways to treat each other with respect and grace, and pray for a time when peace will embrace the region. "

"most terrible of times"
I almost want the PR people to go on strike just to see these assholes fumble on live TV
whats weird is that he picks a side, and he knows he's picking a side and being divisive. Last year when USG held a respectable and nuanced discussion, he had to go and make it about hate speech, when both sides were listening to eachother just fine. its divisive and harmful to our community. kaler is inflaming tensions and polarizing students and faculty against eachother.
Also as a college you do end up aligning with your country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stance on issues

I can't think of Obama w/o this pic. He looks like he's gonna destroy a city like in Evangelion and expel heterosexuality out of everyone
Fr tho if any of y'all need someone to cook I'll do it 4 free.
he can pay the staffs more even without selling his mansion
I really don't understand people like Kaler.

So Hamas is bad because they killed innocent women and children so we should stand with Israel who do the same thing???

where is the logic
i like how this server has just turned into kaler and politics
It's just extra vile too because Israel is now taking tanks directly into Gaza and plan to soon commit one of the worst war crimes in human history
The US and all its ilk have blood on their hands. Although this might just be another Friday for them.
I do not find any amusement in this
Those w power who witness atrocities taking place and willfully fund such acts and turn a blind eye to it are vile vermins
I can't wrap my head around it
It is the fact that this turn of event is so predictable, so by-the-book that it is boring, that it is atrocious. Because it is living proof that nearly 80 years after WWII we still haven't manage to quell such atrocities from happening again. That we still let fascism rise again as a result of capitalism in crisis.
damn rojava reddit got banned for violence lmao
Fuck Edrogan and his ghoulish ilk
If there's any time to be an anarchist, it is now. Or some other type of libleft idk whatever floats ur boat. Point is the state lies. And so do the capitalists that sponsor them.

Don't wanna hold my breath for Lockheed Martin lapdogs tho
Y'all should come if you can. I think it would help people to know they're not alone
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand how Kaler has so much trouble condemning war crimes without also in the process justifying other war crimes
That's because it's never his intention. This is all part of Zionist's justification of murder. To criticise both fascistic force you need to have an understanding of politics beyond team playing the state, something obviously the likes of the ruling class like Kaler is incapable of
To understand both the genocidal white colonist government and the Baathist fascist and Islam ethnonationalists are bad, is something not enough people can comprehend.
Almost like he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t view Palestinians as human beings
Subjugation and an oppressed class is necessary for capitalism to function. A society of haves and have-nots. People say capitalism is about making money/profit and I disagree with that. Capitalism is about TAKING resources that is freely available to all and build walks around it with a caste system. That's why even if we learn for so long that a healthier, comfortably living base living condition for working class people benefit everyone and is very good for the economy, the ruling class would rather everyone be poor and miserable. Their hoping for recession to keep people in line is proof of that:
https://www.shrm.org/executive/resources/articles/pages/ceos-managing-face-recession.aspx#:~:text=Brad%20Jackson%2C%20CEO%20of%20consulting,with%20investors%20and%20their%20employees.

That is because if the wealth difference is no longer as drastic, people wouldn't have to put up with their BS. They'd rather they have 6 and everyone else has 2, than they have 10 and everyone has 8. Money and property are meaningless to them if it can't be used to influence others. And that's the gist of it all. The core of capitalism is the culmination of capital, aka tokens of "Control". And colonialism, carcerality fits perfectly into that goal by definition.
damn y'all really do be wildin' on the indoctrination train
what is happening in gaza right now is not about capitalism or communism, but you're making it about it which is showing a blatant disregard for the lives being lost and the injustice of the situation
same thing that happened with the BLM protests in Portland. a bunch of anarchists showed up and deplatformed the black community by trying to make it about the feds
that is why i'm pissed off
yes it actually is. ignoring the economic factors involved in killing palestinians and colonizing their land, forgoes a huge factor in why this is all happening. If the annihilation of Palestinians wasnt in some way profitable or beneficial for ruling elites, it wouldnt be happening.
wanna bitch about something? bitch about the people who are getting their houses bombed out. the parents who are watching their children die. do **not** make it about you and **your** political beliefs
I am not whitewashing, simply pointing out the fact that you are using the situation to further your agenda. I understand that is upsetting to you and I wish you self awareness and enlightenment.
Zacc, it is clear that we have differing ideas of how these economic systems mold politics and our lives. From your viewpoint, I completely understand how this seems like coopting the suffering of Gazans to further the goals of my own economic beliefs. However, from my viewpoint, these economic systems are more than just about allocating resources and producing labor. They have a libidinal factor that thrives on human suffering and generating hatred of the other, they are interwoven into the fabric of colonization and imperialism. Even though I disagree with you and will still fight to make this point known, I respect your perspective and hope that we can continue to find middle ground on fighting injustice.
that is a very respectful, genuine, and fair rebuttal. thank you, and I hope we can find a middle ground as well. At the end of the day, the thing I care about the most is the lives being lost, and fear that focusing our concern on the systems that are hurting people instead of those people can disconnect us from the humanity of war, and make it even more impersonal and brutal than it already is.
at the end of the day, people are dying, and in my opinion the only thing worth dying for is a life that has been well lived.
sorry, can't help it
most of it goes into no specific company, rather hedge and index funds
Banks are merely middle men. At the end of the day, it's either underpaid labor or bloodshed

Cause he repeats the same part (chorus 1) about 8-10 times, then he goes into his bridge: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìand you know why? It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s because university hospitals (can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember/hear what he says)√¢‚Ç¨ proceeds into chorus 2

||https://vxtwitter.com/hebh_jamal/status/1717649752198725986 || The fact that Kaler never even rectify what he said in the face of literal horrific fascism in action is uh, something.
I'm not confirming anything. But the horrifying part is does this seem outrageous at this point? They have murdered countless children at this point while leaving their victims starved, thirsting, without power or internet and suffer a multitude of infectious diseases and literally call them animals and pests, by actual government officials no less.
fair enuf
I like how it says that they √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsheltered√¢‚Ç¨ when shelters don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exist in Gaza
Palestinians aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t human being so does it really actually matter /s
they're literally gloating over the fact that they have power and clean water, and Palestinians don't
These vile things have abandoned their humanity and they must never be forgiven.
This is why Zionism will never stand for Jewish people
Honestly even the passive voice here doesn't do it justice. The monster that is IDF murdered them
Well might as well share the list of brands who supported Israel to boycott. Prolly won't do much but it's better than nothing.
"Truth" doesn't matter to them because they already a ton of justification their BS, and the system to protect them. It is when the status quo alters that they lash out and panic.
So sad that Halloween is ona Tuesday üòî
Never forget and never forgive that even after Israel dropped a bomb in a refugee camp, Kaler refused to walk back on his statements.

no I think this is the guy who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mad at the hospital
omg i passed by him the other day
i honestly couldn't tell what he was saying either
He is apparently saying "there is a thief in the house" because someone at UH stole his "gold chain" when he got an MRI
At least that's what someone said in the class of 2026 server
that explains why someone thought he was saying THERE ARE BEES IN YOUR HOUSE
They really do be sayin "cope and seethe"

The man on Euclid is making dog sounds √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbowowowow√¢‚Ç¨ because the system (UH power structure) treats him like a dog. Alternatively, he alludes that they treat four legged creatures (dogs) better than two legged ones (humans).

I interviewed him a week ago and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll post the synopsis when I get back
Johnny G is a USAF veteran who flew in KC-130s as a Crew Chief. After returning to the States, he's "run clubs all over Cleveland". His gold necklace was obtained from Thailand and is allegedly a family heirloom. Some time over the summer or last year he had a medical procedure that required an MRI screening, and his chain was taken from him sometime then. This led him to protest outside of UH, saying things like theres a thief in the house, bowowowow/woof woof woof..., and I aint going nowhere. Today marks day 78 since he first started. When inquired on why he is so persistent, he simply explained that, "I have fun doing it" as a retiree. It's unknown how long he will continue, but if you listen closely you can always find or hear his rhythmic chanting roll along the corridors of Euclid Avenue.
I was working from memory.

Blackmailing queer people on campus apparently isn't off limit for this mofo. Then again, Israel has been blackmailing queer Palestinians too. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree I see.

Yeah I really don't think this is the kind of thing I can joke about if the "no Nazi jokes" principle applies
Oh
Remember, this isn't just a genocide on Palestinians. This is a slaughter of innocence, especially innocence of children. This is what Kaler stands for.

In all honesty tho, this is but a beginning. We gotta keep up the pressure to push out these war profiteering promoters.

who wants to get really high and watch this movie with me in 30 days
I 100% want to watch this now

I can't believe they made a movie about my girlfriend:

If this it to remove your hold on sis for course registration no it doesn't count.
The list really just keeps growing. Like this one isn't even about Palestinians, this is just Israel being a white settler colonist state that exploits Jews of color. Aligning Judaism and Zionism is buckwild.
Boring
Like I don't think these morons understand how powerful an apology(even if half assed) can sway the population to their favor

and you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not obligated to sit and read through all this stuff. The beauty of the internet is you can ignore stuff you dont want to read
you will consume all the internet at once
yeah this is more of a personal complaint than something that I actually want people to fix I guess
REALLY I just wish that people would stop committing atrocities but apparently that is TOO MUCH TO ASK
yeah that unfortunately is something that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not gonna happen
I mean Kaler can't even do sth as lukewarm as divesting from Israel. The bar really is on the floor
i wouldn't call that lukewarm given the jewish population of the school
Fair enuf
Also if this phenomena was exclusive  to campuses with high Jewish populations then why is it happening in almost all other campuses in the US. Where they arguably treat protestors even worse than here?
And magically they all care about Jewish people now? Get real. They didn't give a flying fvck when fascists attacked synagogues. What makes you think these rich assholes will do this out of the kindness in their heart?
This is imperialist and Evangelical Christian death cult propaganda as clear as day and night.
What drives you to initiate these discussions so frequently? I think your language is becoming more volatile and borders becoming discriminatory against certain groups with how much you're consuming and cross-posting inflammatory social media posts. I see the same thing in alt-right meme servers I filter memes out of, where people just spam content that has a heavy under-current of hate, because of whatever political uproar is present.
Fortunately, this is server of 2025, but I don't think this should be an everyday occurrence
For the past month, this chat has just been nonstop posts from someone who feels very strongly and perhaps personally on this global conflict. Your response to Zacc was literally him responding to a post you started. In some ways, I do think that this mass consumption of weaponized trauma culture on social media is creating a legitimate problem on this server. And I disagree with Julia on this front, because the ugliness of the internet is that people inherently will not and should not be expected to ignore the stuff they shouldn't read. Your posting is the only thing anyone on this server can read. You're not changing the status quo on this dead server, the only reason someone could put it here is if they wanted to feel good about themselves, even if what they were doing benefitted no one and merely served to alienate every other person due to the nature of the topic.
You would be surprised at the depth to which politics and radical behavior has penetrated into internet memes, and it's something that should concern you. It's hate masquerading as "harmless humor", and yall should be aware of it just as much as you soap box about legitimate threats to the Palestinian people. No one can discern between whether you're rabidly promoting it or making legitimate statements against the status quo, because you're the only one pouring it in this feed that people will understandably not want to contest or disagree about enough to argue with you. Jeneral was for "chitchat" (ie discussion), but it's turned into this endless stream of one person's pointed thoughts that discourages real productivity.

This is a very sad way for a server to die especially an official one for a school, but I think it's sort of ironic as this is what freedom of speech looks like, when the loudest dominate, and regular people don't care enough to engage
That's an awful lotta assumptions about my intentions when bringing attention to this matter when literally the number 1 thing many Palestinians orgs has been saying is "don't stop talking about it" as genocide is actively happening.
And I have been limiting my posting so it so it doesn't become too frequent but apparently this is still to much.
I truly wish posting about this could make me feel good like you described it rather than a desperate cycle of wanting to keep visibility of the struggling Palestinian alive as the deafening silence on campus settle in and we just go about our day while Palestinian are martyred by the hundreds. And I know for a fact I ain't the only person on this campus or this server who feels this way.
Fair enough
I mean I feel like it's okay to have a healthy discussion about this, especially since it does affect people on campus, but more and more I've seen it devolve into some weird form of  stonewalling. I think conversation is the only way that people are going to actually understand the other side, and so I think discouraging that is bad. My main fear is this conflict happening across a big ass ocean will do a lot of bad in dividing communities on our campus
like my whole thing is I feel like you should be able to say whatever you want, as long as you don't get to hide behind a mask, and people get to criticize you for it
There wasn't that much of "dividing" until Kaler chimed in and boost Zionist narrative
I just really hate it when people argue with the burning passion of a thousand suns so I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not exactly an impartial participant here. I am trying to let discussions happen bc obviously it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an important issue but there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also a point where it completely overshadows the actual purpose of the server
I am not even close to an expert on middle eastern politics but I don't think taking kaler seriously has done anyone in the undergrad part of CWRU any good
grab your large grains of salt, but kaler didn't come off as zionist to me, he came off as "gotta cover my ass"
which I think personally might be worse
yeah the really fucked up thing is that his motivation seems to just be money, not an actual ideology
my issue with his statements is not him taking sides, its his apparent disregard for the student body, and how they feel.
like dude you're supposed to represent the faculty, staff, and students of the university, not our endowment
Anyhow, if you want to help people effected by it on the relief / food side of things I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d suggest donating to share the meal. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re one of the only orgs actively working in that region to serve civilians
From people who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve spoken to him, this is what they feel. He doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t particularly care but the people who give a lot of funds to the school do
This is my personal take on this.

As Julia said, what Tanakapilio brought up about nazism wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t appropriate in the slightest, not good. But completely shutting down someone trying to talk about what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the right thing to do. 

- Politics is ingrained in your daily life. You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t simply separate it from school. You need to educate yourself because it literally affects you.
- Politics as a topic includes discourse. One can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learn without engaging in a conversation, especially in this university where discussing Palestine isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t exactly welcome.
- If you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to discuss or expose yourself to this, then don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. You can ignore whoever√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s talking about the genocide, but that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean you can shut down whoever wants to talk about it.
- Some people might be checking out what Tanakapilio has been sending but don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to expose themselves.
- Feel free to turn a blind eye to what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening to Palestinians. But, at the very least, do appreciate that you can clock in and out of reality whenever you want, because some people can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t shut down people who are trying to speak out for them.
- **Don't forget that if discourse was not allowed on this server, Julia wouldn't have been able to correct Tanakapilio's point and¬†educate¬†them.**
- Social movements start by having conversations like these with people who don't know necessarily know about it. Obviously it's not gonna happen overnight, but every conversation counts.
Answering Rob's point, barely any aid is being allowed into Gaza. If you want to help, educate yourself and those around you, and demand ceasefire.
Because ***with every passing day, more airstrikes are landing on people's heads, and hundreds more are dying***. 
=> You can find multiple resources on how you can call¬†for¬†ceasefire.
As much as I wanna keep the volume of this discussion low, I can't not mention the fact of what's going on in Gaza right now.
cw: description of death, settler violence 
||https://www.ddinstagram.com/reel/CzjhUyatNTe/ 
√¢‚Ç¨≈ì Translation: Hello my name is bissan and i am still alive, today is day 38 of war 12/11/2023. And i will tell you what is happening in all the provinces because nowhere is safe. In RAFAH: they found 4 martyrs from the bombing yesterday. In KHAN YOUNES: they bombed a complete residential complex, this result in killing 25 civilians from 6 families. And in the North: in BAIT LAHIA, they bombed a school that have refugees. And shooting around Andonesian Hospital to block and scare people inside. Different houses in the North were bombed but no one knows exactly which houses because there is no media coverage, and People can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t communicate with their families to check if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re safe or no. In AL NASER Neighborhood, they bombed Mahdi Hospital and killed 2 doctors. they blocked the Al Shifa Hospital, shooting all the people trying to go out, this result in around 100 bodies in the hospital yard waiting for someone to bury them. Plus 8 prematures babies were killed because the newborn intense care unit has stopped working. This blockage means there is no electricity, no oxygen, no fuel, no food or anything left for the people blocked inside. They also bombed Al Buraq School, in the 3 floors there was more than 100 displaced people and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still under rubble. They also bombed a christian school and Alef B school, these two schools had displaced people too. Until now they are blocking different neighborhoods in the west of Gaza city. 
All this is in addition to the displacement of people from the north to the south in a very difficult conditions. And finally bombing UNDP Compound that contains dozens of refugees. √¢‚Ç¨≈ì||
If you don't wanna see this, simplely scroll past this message. I just think I would like to mention this as how this university have allowed the likes of Kaler to spew his Zionist narrative as ||settler colonists are invading hospitals and killing children and the disabled, considering as their victory.|| All while Case is a university well known for its hospitals and medical researches/programs. Isn't this the epitome of hypocrisy in Case's quest to "correct the historical ethics violation in medical field"?
The thing is that I have gone to like several talks of University Hospitals where they were so proud of having a new ethics department to analyze and devise answers for ethical dilemma in medical practices. Yet none of them are concerned with the elephant in the room: the ethics of a for-profit healthcare system, and now the funneling of university money into the hands of genocidal colonists who are targetting hospitals and ambulances.
I understand that not everyone wanna see this so you can delete all these messages if you want. I just wanna leave this here so I don't have any regrets.
lmfao its just college kids trying to tune out a genocide happening. its understandable to not want to hear this stuff, but I think construing someone trying to share the news in any way possible as inflammatory or enacting some type of aggression on others, is just a pathetic way to deal with the reality that people are suffering and you couldnt care less about it.
Trying to share stuff here is like beating a dead horse. Take it for what it is, a "meme" server that serves as a qna occasionally. nothing more nothing less.
I mean I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so. I think everyone is trying to grapple with this in different ways and to just generalize it and say that people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about others is not necessarily the truth
I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think a college discord server is the place to discuss stuff like this lmfao
Yeah i dont think so either, but i think the response to tanakapilio was harsh especially considering the intensity of the conflict
I mean. The equation to Nazism was inappropriate. There is a lot of animosity on this campus and to say something like that only makes things worse
regardless if they were just mentioning what someone else said, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not appropriate
My thoughts on the matter don't entirely align with yours, but I don't think debating here is going to do anything to help either side.
This server acts like the bad ending of a Twilight Zone episode
so true this server is exactly like being trapped in a nightmare parallel dimension, for example a reality in which aliens invade and begin killing and eating the human population
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to find a good gif of rob sterling
I have to listen to a bunch of podcasts and I hate podcasts!!!!!!!
so unfortunately
Under the folder "podcasts that i want to listen to but never will, but ill still talk about the topics as if i did"
Wouldnt that sort of defeat the purpose of their posts? The whole point of posting this content is to point more attention towards a group who doesn't frequently receive media coverage. By quarantining posts into a channel people ignore, it's similar to telling someone to protest in a space that no one in the public will see, it's contradictory.
yeah that is a good point I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just in a bad mood and salty at their immaturity lmfao
Children in Gaza don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the ability to clock in and out of reality whenever they like. But we have the ability to turn off the notifications and protect our mental health when we need to. 

Mental health is not even a thing for children in Gaza. Their only concern is surviving. Feel free to exercise your ability to protect your mental health cuz that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a right you have, but when there are people who are willing to speak for the voiceless, please respectfully let them do so.

If your goal is just to sympathize, then be my guest. But you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not helping anyone when there is so much that you can do as a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìrandom college student.√¢‚Ç¨
Oh ü•∫
Anyone a senior here who can reserve a class for me please?
Honestly I also don't think enough people talk about the fascism that is running rampant in the Philippines as a result of US colonialism.
I guess if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t back US-foreign interests enough they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t build you a world class special operations unit or infrastructure to dominate whatever government or group  that opposes you (Philippines)

funniest shit ever is marx did not understand calculus

well we can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expect him to be good at everything he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s from the past
(people now should be good at everything and if they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a moral failing)
sorry I literally do not even know what the point of what I just said was

Really putting the "hypocite" in "Hippocratic Oath"
i don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t agree that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tankie posting necessarily because I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve definitely heard anarchists say that but it is the kind of thought that can lead to radicalization and is definitely the sort of thing I hear a lot in leftist communities online  in, like, the months before those communities are taken over by tankies
or if they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taken over by tankies they start unironically advocating violence against groups of people they disagree with
Im not disputing that liberals are bad and make fascism easier, which I think is what was meant by the phrase. but the actual WORDING of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìscratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds√¢‚Ç¨ states that liberals ARE fascists in disguise, which is something that I do not think is a healthy thought to be flirting with
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t disagree with the sentiment behind the message but I disagree with the way it was presented
But like recently that's kinda what is happening? "We can't pay for healthcare infrastructure and student debt" but suddenly it's war crimin time and instantly they can dispense billions of dollars? Either they're really bad at their job or really blatant liars about their intent. And given how many of these "liberals" used to say disgusting things about marginalized people, you'd have to think which is their trie color
but I do not think it is fair to say they are fascists
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not wrong tho
I think if someone says √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyour ideology is too extreme√¢‚Ç¨ and you say √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhorseshoe theory moment√¢‚Ç¨ you are not really disputing what they said
he isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t being a centrist he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just saying he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worried that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been too radicalized which I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think is necessarily an unfair concern to have
Because I don't think I have to explain how conflating extreme fascism with "extreme" antifascism is an extremely privileged position
he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t correlate extreme anti fascism with extreme fascism
explain what that "extreme" is because so far I don't see anything that could be other than horseshoe theory
I am mod the opinion that both far left and far right American political ideologies blatantly disregard the human condition
I do want to say that I am someone who is pretty far to the left and you are still a lot farther left than I am. and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s possible to disagree with the extremity of your opinions without being a centrist
I still did not correlate fascism and anti fascism
jfc "far left extreme" isn't a thing
Castro force feeding people castor oil until they died would like to have a conversation with you
What, dictatorships are bad? Me too guy, me too
That "far left extreme" is literally red scare propaganda of a lukewarm liberal nationalist government
Ain't a fan of castro
But to call him "far left extreme" is hilarious
centralized government is as far from "left" as you can imagine
They all suck LMAO
yeah I mean I agree that he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not the best example but that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s because ppl who are extreme leftists don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t become dictators. but it is possible to be extreme far left to an extent that is dangerous
People who are extreme leftists become either college professors, Starbucks employees, or fentanyl addicts üò≥
Explain to me what these "far left extremist" looks like because so far all I see is either liberals of other countries presltending to be communists.
my problem with being extreme extreme far left is that there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a certain point where you start seeing everyone right of you as the enemy for one reason or another, and that becomes very scary and is not necessarily in line with reality
most of the extreme far left people I have seen are people in leftists subreddits who over time become more and more radicalized until they start seeing everyone who is not as far left as them as fascists and evil
No seriously because none of the examples u provided make sense of your definition so far
god I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t list them off the top of my head because I forget facts under pressure let me see if I can find them by searching thru my post history
You hate the Soviet but ate all their propaganda up?
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll see if I can find what I was talking about but I ended up leaving most of these subs so it might take a bit to find it
iirc there was one post in particular that was saying the left needs to hoard guns or something? like to defend ourselves against the fascists?? this is obviously a very extreme example but a lot of the comments were unironically agreeing with the sentiment of the post
no you ain't, you ain't got any capital at that. You're a capitalist supporter
so you think that because there are fascists, people on the left should be hoarding guns?
you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so worried about fascism that you no longer believe in gun control, one of the major ideological cornerstones of the American left?
As much as I don't like weapons
if the left is able to hoard guns then so is everyone else
The very fact that you think cops give a shit about people√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s political ideology is what makes you deluded imo. They care about whether you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re black and poor, not whether you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a commie
If you fight the us government in a conventional war you have already lost
I think they shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be getting in a PHYSICAL WAR in the first place
If they want to kill you they will.
Just because it isn't for you, doesn't mean it's not for other people
For these communities it is a life or death situation where law  enforcement is literally gonna terroriE them day and night
the fact that the cops will kill people without reason does not mean that there is any group of people for whom the streets of their city are a literal war zone against the police
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even tell what y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all are arguing for anymore
there are people who are at disproportionately greater risk of being murdered by cops, and that IS bad and SHOULD change, but it does not mean that we should form civilian militias to fight them
Fascists don't attack people because they're a threat, they attack because they're easy targets
and that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m kind of worried about you, dude
I dipped as soon as my point about cops being racist was glossed over. Apparently union busting is just as important
I don't think I wanna argue either. I only care about the current ceasfire
oh speaking of which
this guy clearly equates Judaism with Zionism and is probs anti semitic behind closed doors. just not worth it to argue. The situation in Gaza is atrocious for all innocent parties involved and the Israeli and U.S. governments should be ashamed of themselves for this pathetic excuse of a ceasefire.
Idk about that bud cuz so far y'all have wild different definitions of what "extremism" looks like lmao
I thought you blocked me bc you couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t handle someone contradicting your opinion
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care what you think. Extremism on both sides is bad. Easy as that
Disliking someone based on their political views is real mature bud
and I am allowed to block stuff I don't wanna see
You mean, you don't see the point in listening to the will of Palestinians of never stop talking about it? Weird take Ig
What part did I say that made you think I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about a fucking genocide
And stop talking to me for crying out loud.
@tanakapilio Today you are angry. One day when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve blocked enough people out of your life, you will find yourself still angry. Then and only when you are alone with your anger, will you will find the true source of your rage.
Miss ma√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢am are you high

i dont think they have the budget for that
Kissinger is dead...
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel like I even need to refute that. I think we can all see the reasons why we disagree with what you just said and trying to debate would be a waste of time
How anhali feels trying to regain control of the server each day over the same argument

Why not find a more reputable source than √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMintPress√¢‚Ç¨ and come back to me
also if it is true that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make electoral politics a scam. one does not flow from the other
Very quick google search just said: the shit you post here is not necessarily reputable√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùbest bet is to find unbiased news sources üòÅ
Buddy, that's not an analysis piece, that's literally what happened 
https://vxtwitter.com/StopZionistHate/status/1729911561630683417
For someone supposedly "against Zionism" you ain't keepin up w the news
Buddy, like I said, find me a source that isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t from Twitter
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m against Zionism but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to prove that to you.
And I don't gotta prove reality to a centrist either
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m literally a registered Democrat what do you want me to say
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a far left wacko that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so deep into the rabbit hole that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s honestly pathetic
I know this guy needs to get banned

Privilege is believing centrism isn't propaganda
being right of you doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make people centrists
you are literally the furthest left a human being could be. most people are less far left than you
that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make them wrong or bad
Idk, quack like a duck, walk like a duck and got a bunch of duck friends
what the fuck are you even talking about
You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just gonna be real lonely at the end of the day. Hope you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re ok with that
Let alone communicate
being a registered democrat voter doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make it impossible for you to be further left than the Democratic Party :crii: :crii: :crii: :crii: :crii:
Genuinely just sad
SEVERAL PPL TYPING?? Dont yall got class
Really?
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not the opinion they hold that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the problem. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the way you treat other people that have a different opinion from yourself. When you get that through your thick head, you will understand. But by then, you will be a sad, lonely neckbeard
I can see when people leave and the rate people leave at has not really changed over the entire 3-4 years of running this server
CENTRISM BAD!!!!
For this to happen
I find the conflict to be ill-fitting of the larger community discourse
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s possible that some people are leaving for that reason but there are 700+ people in this server so it makes sense that some people would be disatisfied. most of our mod team is minorities and I have never been given the impression by anyone on this server that they feel that they are not respected by us
How about show me how you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re related to Judaism and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll allow you to preach about who and who isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t anti semitic. Gfy genuinely

i thought you didn't engage with centrists btw
so I guess people are gonna keep doing the "breathe out through the window-mounted air conditioner" strat for the time being
Breaking news: they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care
Y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all need to stop talking to this fucker that only wants you to argue

nah never touch the stuff
Sounds like a dead meme to me üòî
Can't forget noun-posting too
The humor comes from the release of tension, when someone's expectations are broken and two ideas are revealed to be in disorder. This deviates from traditional comedy, where two distinct ideas are revealed by the comic to have a connection through a metaphor or analogy. Both build tension, but the cathartic release revealing the universe to be all connected or completely irrational is what makes each form of humor so unique
Meme production will halt for 24 hours for recalibration
people cant smoke in public, or grow at home, and theres a hefty tax
all this does is let rich people do it legally, and just make it even more "justifiable" for poor people to get btfo'd by law enforcement
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tempt me
dogs better sorry to break it to yall
centrist *smh my head*
you filthy fucking centrist pig you disgust me /s
no messages have been sent it's so sad. no one cares about the classical arts anymore
omg it IS Hanukkah
Yeah my bf didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it either idk
Could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been someone put all the math SIs on there or something
Does anyone know how the math 201 final with pup looks like?
yeah me too.. I just left it tbh
i just dont open my emails
So after interviewing the UH protester, I wanted to shift to a different demographic. This time I wanted to explore the relationship between in-state blue-collar workers, most likely lacking a college-education working on a campus educating students with a predominately high family  income and socioeconomic status that are typically out-of-state or even out-of-country (especially high-income).
How does a group that CWRU students are even more isolated from compared to their African-American counterparts in the Cleveland/East Cleveland area compare to the campus they're working for. I'm talking about the white, no-college education construction workers who are working on the new dorms next to Fribley compared to a progressive campus in a liberal city (especially when compared to Ohio whose white working-class represent the state's right-wing).

I want to interview people, who people deem not worth talking to even if they're placed smack dab in their face. Look at the homeless amputee woman on Euclid or the protester in front of University Hospitals that went out there EVERY DAY, but no one asked who he was until I did it myself. 
Those workers are literally building the place some of us will be living in, and we don't even know who they are. Y'all keep asking who are the people who are standing in the way of your political interests, and I'm telling you they're right here. They're the silent voting group that isn't engaged by the younger generation. And there's plenty of other individuals and groups in Cleveland and beyond that are similarly overlooked.
(So to clarify: I was driving Saferide, and I brought a pair of gloves with me. A few hours into my shift I noticed that one of my gloves was missing, and I could not find it. I had not stepped outside of the car before then. I'm also missing a pack of gum too under the same circumstances.)
im surprised it wasnt the skulls of the "indentured servants" shes such a fan of
what if I don't have hands this is so ableist
aren't the kalers jewish
miss maam xmas is a secular holiday
to be fair it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a secular holiday that is usually celebrated by jewish people
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe Eric Kaler is Jewish, not sure why that matters though
apparently it was like a "harvest" thing
yea "we wish you a merry christmas" sure ain't about hannukah
ok that came off bad
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m tired and i just landed in your homeland Zachary
sorry
I mean that more as a "well why didn't you say so"
connecting flight
I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wish spending time in the Charlotte airport on my worst enemy
Hannah stop trying to go to zacc√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s house !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no i hate it
why have you been in the charlotte airport?
it sucks
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrible
RDU is a bitchin' airport
i hate charlotte
hannah airport tier list FOIA request
Detroit is the best airport you are right about that
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s such a good airport
i do have my airport ranking somewhere
frankfurt is also a good airport although if you miss a flight there they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll redirect you through like 4 or 5 different European countries
they DO have foosball I have a photo of me and some high school classmates playing foosball after we were trapped overnight in the frankfurt airport after which they redirected us through like 4 or 5 different european countries
This is my favorite airport
There's this one ramen place at the detroit airport and it's so good
who the fuck is walter
annie never found out who walter was and spend the rest of her life not knowing
i need to obtain food in the charlotte airport
Do you need food food or just a snacc
your definition of a snack and my definition of a snack seem to vary
We didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t let you take our cabbage or pork belly
We taking that shit anyways üò§
if you're serious, its like an hour drive. Ig you could like take the bus to its furthest stop and then uber, but you might want to look into something like megabus or greyhound, they might have routes that go further than rta
likely tho, bus -> uber is going to be cheapest, will take a while tho
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think Geneva is big enough for greyhound to go through, unfortunately
Ok so like shot in the dark, but what if we turned the Spot under Leutner into a dedicated lounge for jazz, open mikes, bands who want to play there, and whoever wants to show stuff off . We could serve light appetizers that try to make it seem a little more high class (maybe with help from cooking club) and perhaps also have Tippit Tea operate there, too.
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that similar to jolly karaoke
yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been trying to convince the jazz combo I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in to hold an open jam sesh there but it costs like a crazy amount to book
stay tuned to see where the philadelphia airport falls in this
I'm kinda surprised there isn't a 2028 server yet
just seeing the year 2028 makes me feel elderly
Ik writers workshop at case reviews research and class writings, but would they be inclined to read and review an independent fictional work?
im bad at jokes
They couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go online for a day? I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get how this school makes decisions
Kaler gets a lot more hate than he deserves tbh
I just feel kind of bad
idk about you but i wouldn't exactly be happy about an old white man use my tuition money for useless things
our laundry machines dont even work
Good evening, CWRU 2025. I come to you completely vulnerable and desperate. I have a Tuesday 4:30-7:30 PM O chem 2 slot that interferes with an immovable event from 6 PM-9PM on Tuesdays. I am pleading that someone has and is willing to part with their Monday lab, Tuesday 1-4, orWednesday lab. I would be forever in your debt, and I would be willing to pay upwards of $100 and also do almost any non-monetary exchange, as well. If you know, anyone that would be willing, please put me in contact and I would also be indebted to you.
Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bro transferüò≠
Anyone able to drop Csds 221 so my friend can get in?
What exam
EMT class module one exam on ethics, PPE, basics of patient treatment and comms, etc (introduction) and I legitimately thought I failed by question 30, I was last to leave (I passed but I locked in so hard it was like my first chemistry exam in college)
Sorry about ur bike bud
i just left it thre
don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take ur bike out until u get a locküò≠
why is it so damn hard to get a drink on this campus
oh wowza
I want to eat
one of my friends said she wanted to dribble him like a basketball
Navalny dead
Damn that sucks
is it still flooding?
I left like an hour ago and it was. Not sure about now
It used to just be a cost per user not a cost per storage, 

Then Google changed it where it costs the same per user but you need to pay for storage on top of that which hugely increased the cost to Case. 

So now they delete old users to get the storage back and save money. It sucks but not really Case's fault
oh damn
that can't be good
yes, and case has enough money to keep em, esp since their tuition increases that are higher than inflation. There were plans that were discussed, but kaler is the one who turned them down in favor of more money in the boards pockets
wtf üíÄ
my sorority had a mixer today and we bob rosses and i kind of ate and i want more people to see my art
i feel like i unlocked my hidden potential
you and I can be like omg class of 2030! class of 2030 discord server üò±
class of 2030
I asked cuz that was with my fraternity lol

I had a meeting for a project that got scheduled during that mixer so I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go to it sadly
Were you able to come to tub off?
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be tubbing off next year tho
what the fuck are you guys talking about
Yet we only get 100 GB
the org i used to be in wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t national panhellenic so its ok to rush another
damn, they our here adding 500+/semester  for each housing type
damn, they scalping tonight
I was doing math
also, they forgot to remove their fib from the housing website
According to my research, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in Americans, so this leads me to believe that we need to start attacking hearts
Any idea who pissed of the administration
university is a 501c3 we don't pay taxes
I mean that is a fair statement
https://tinyurl.com/vandalismatcwru

please help me report all these vandals! I can't do it all alone
a) I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m glad you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re annoying them about this because it seriously bothers me
b) maybe #self-promos so it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get buried by people talking in general? 
c) I think I have that exact same tshirt
I mean like, they're not wrong in that sjp did violate the policy multiple times
me when a bunch of college students gets compared to al capone
glue isn't mentioned at all in the posting policy
they just made shit up to suspend sjp
but since they kept saying in the email that the glue violated the posting policy that proves they didn't even read it before jumping the gun
doesnt surprise me at all that they would fail even reading their own standards
I think we need to get them suspended cuz they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re breaking their own rules
damn i just read that and i am not surprised that you're right
they did still technically violate posting policy by not posting solely on permitted posting areas but like
i mean like I don't agree with all of the stuff that SJP does or says but i'll still fight for their right to say it
they could have leaned fully into the vandalism angle which is still really stupid bc acetone exists but whatever
but the glue thing shows they didn't even fucking read them lmfao
It's just gonna mobilize members of the SJP anyways, its already getting a bunch of attention
I think they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just making tensions even worse
Just making everything worse fr
i don't understand why they can't just like
still fucked though
They can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bc unfortunately board of trustees is predominantly Zionist
Just √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdoesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make sense√¢‚Ç¨ for them to be neutral unfortunately
Case can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t afford acetone
the other thing is it is blatantly bad business (and sometimes illegal) to do things that reduce the value of your investments/corporate entities
Kaler serves at the pleasure of the board, and we saw with Harvard and UPenn that if a president isn't zionist enough the media and the board will force them out
Their money is focused on funding military and building unnecessary buildings
i don't think y'all understand how expensive it is to run a university tho
Definitely so expensive they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t afford a bottle of acetone
it's definitely not going to the professors bc their pay is shit
it's not tho
also most of the universitys money doesn't come from tuition anyways
well the idea is the people who can afford to pay full price will, and the people who can't will just get scholarships/loans
apple does the same thing with phone storage. you can still get an iphone if you can't afford the top model, you just get less storage
need
it appears as though the board of trustees does not get paid for sitting in their position
sorry, I meant a quarter
Still üíÄ
That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s insane considering how shit the food is
sorry I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on my phone rn so I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look
just under another third goes to scholarships, stipends, fellowships, etc
do scholarships really count as expenses? wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that be more like profit loss
idk I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not an economist
well it looks like all the study abroad kids are about to get their trips abruptly ended
plus since tape is way harder to remove from glass than glue their punishment should be even worse
after he got stuck in the spring trap suit
holy shit
they ask witnesses and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re like √¢‚Ç¨≈ìidk he was purple√¢‚Ç¨ and then the STUPID COPS are looking for a purple man when actually he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just regular looking when he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not crimes!!!!!
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe zacc is purple guy
it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard because you have spring lock hands
whyi ods is so hard ty[ type o,
get out there and purple the whole neighborhood of guys!!! who will stop you? you have that power queen !!!!!!!!
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna go to Freddy√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s house and spend five nights there until he can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave
I accidentally sprayed my whole hand with dichloromethane, and when i went to the TA, he said it would be fine, then said he thought it was a carcinogen
then i looked it up and it apparently readily permeates nitrile gloves
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ok I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve touched EtBr and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still here
Unfortunately
i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been exposed to 2000V and i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m still kicking
one time i broke something in orgo lab and i checked after the lab was over and it turned out i cut my hand and i did the whole lab with an open wound
Holy crap
CWRU lab rats when they find out that the stuff they work with actually does stuff
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that the perfect white noise while you daydream while staring into nothing
y'all don't headcanon jesus as an absolute hunk tho?
He went into creative and tried to pass it off as survival
i think the idea behind the character design was that He didn't have to conform to society's standards of power, which is why he is shown in the image of the common man as an exultation of the christian god's power. The juxtaposition between normal looking guy vs superpower is a literature device
damn
that's sick
Damn
Guys what happened with STJ and Kaler, 
Now something going on between Bon appetite and MSA?
Damn üòû
what happened with stj and kaler?
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know much about what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going on, but the bon appetit and MSA I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d personally take with a grain of salt
Basically, y√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢all know how admin has been treating advocates for Palestine (mainly sjp)

Yet the school pretends to care for Muslim students even though Palestine is mostly a Muslim population
I saw one of their meals, it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look too bad although I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d prefer bigger portions, more protein, and more flavor
But something is missing, idk what it is
I think they also messed up the time that the fast is broken
Which is crazy bc I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m the worst religious person there is and even I know when the fast is broken
Case doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about anyone üíØüíØüíØ
Imo even worse, the OG Christian√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s are from Palestine and no one seems to give a fluff soooooo
Although Kaler doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem to be doing this just for funding
I can fix her üòû
Omg spill how
So Bone apple tea makes bad food and kaler is still a crappy person?
Bone apple teeth√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s food is never that good
Ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t no way to get through this other than that
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a good Muslim man tho
Tbh I choose not to judge bc idk if I can mass produce food that well myself
bro i can't believe muslims are so fast
Fighting the urge to shit post rn
they could go a long way with just some spice man
still counts kek
even if you're not muslim anymore, your background is still there
Not exactly√¢‚Ç¨¬¶my parents were interfaith. I consider Islam to be less theologically wrong than Christianity but I was Catholic for a while bc I lived w my mom.
Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fully get over the purity guilt I have so I just keep it at arms length for now
Yeah kids don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do interfaith relationships if you have an IQ lower than a carrot
damn how was it for you
Idk but I got second hand roids from ur mom last night
as an expert in healthn't, i don't recommend roids
Aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you quitting cigs
Yeah I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t smoke lmao that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why I get the ems called on me for crying in the bathroom
God forbid a person cry
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cope with life I just live it
omg how do you live with no cope
Idk every day just kind of feels the same and unreal now
really?
what in the fuck
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got no attendees at my modern physics SI session today. The topic is **3-D quantum mechanics & the hydrogen atom**

If anyone wants to talk quantum with me, please feel free to pop by Rockefeller 306

Or Id love to talk about anything else even slightly related too.
sorry I would have come but I had a bunch of work today!
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to lose her bro
Try to start a mewing streak, I know it won't directly solve your current wifi issue, but people will be much more inclined to help you if they see a defined jawline compared to a beta male recessed chin. This observation has been derived from my own interpersonal experiences with beta males as an emerging star in the sigma male community. Last semester, before starting mewing, mouth tape, and hunter eye massages, I asked a TA for a regrade on one of my exams, he refused to give back points. That same TA this semester (for a separate course) awarded me all of my points -- irrespective of whether I deserved them or not -- simply because I mogged him in that room. I refuse to be denied basic human rights (i.e., not having a perfect exam score of 100) by an inferior beta male; mewing/semen retention/bonesmashing has offered me High T, and I will be forever grateful to those who introduced me to this sigma male practice.
Can confirm @chandachan is a certified sigma male well on his way to achieving Gigachad status also if he hasn't already
Gotta give credit to where credit is due, I owe a debt of gratitude to ralex for being my mentor in the looksmaxxing community and for his unwavering support over the months. Could not have asked for a better mentor
Sudden realization that I have to stop feeling sorry for myself as a beta male + the need to achieve my maximum potential as a sigma male
How would you know if you don't try it? No harm in creating a positive habit for yourself, small changes can make big differences in the long run. Start mewing today and see how it goes, not my fault nor yours that beta males don't mew, if you want to remain a beta male, it's time to change.
I have a presentation coming up and I am woefully confused bc I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand electricity
charge flows from cathode to anode, current flows from anode to cathode. whether or not the pH of the battery is affected is dependent on the battery chemistry. For the most part though, state of charge of a battery is negatively correlated with pH, so an empty battery has a higher pH than a full battery due to the increase in electrons within the electrolyte.
now im lost
Yk what I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rly care
And I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want them to think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sped
I'm sorry to hear that, hope all is going well, let us know if we can help in any way or if you need this chat to listen üíØ (serious, no trolling)
Unfortunately probably one of the more mentally stable ppl at this school
Idk if I needed to clarify that nothing I say here is serious üíÄüíÄ
Ahhh, I recognize this particular kavkaz individual now, you're giving me too many dead giveaways üëÄ I thought you were from Ukraine????
Nvm if you think that you need help
Would have been the class clown if that field wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t so male dominated
Sorry, this is way out of pocket, I'll retire myself from the convo, and from the server for 10 years, bye bye
Omg your boyfriend√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s THE gigachad
Can someone explain the one man protest in front of UH hospital
bc someone interviewed him last semester and I think his deal is he had a necklace stolen during an MRI and has been protesting about it because he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s retired and he has a lot of time on his hands
is that what that noise was when I was in class?
wish I had that much time
So according to him he went for a procedure and he lost/had a chain stolen that was a family heirloom. So now he protests near daily and from in his car sometimes, which he enjoys because he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s retired and has nothing else to do. He has three voice lines √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t goin nowhere√¢‚Ç¨ √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a thief in the house√¢‚Ç¨ and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbowowowowow [dog sounds]√¢‚Ç¨. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also a former USAF Vietnam vet.
@everyone There's a paella event this Friday starting at 6:00 PM at Hovorka Atrium, feel free to stop by for free food and socialize
Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come
too late
Do not release this information to me I will troll too hard
You talking to Kemal after you get there and all the food is gone
Me when @tutormaster_ doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t respond to me
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m leaving the chat
@pinkfluffyunicorn999 You were missed at the event yesterday? :sadcat1: Are you coming to the TSA event tomorrow?
Yeah I wanted to come but my legs have been fucked up lately and felt rly funny so I went home
I may be able to, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m seeing my boyfriend today so it depends on when I get back
I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really know the main artist, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll still go for the food and the case bands. Plus springfest has generally been pretty fun
there's a joke in there, but it would suck to have to hinge on such low brow humor
i had a rly bad experience at tattoo cafe
like. the other places got the job done but the placement is bad / shop wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t clean / sketchy experience
(except absolutely do not go to the one on coventry for anything)
good for tattoos but rly bad for piercings
This will be during fall break, but there is plenty of time to tour all 3 cities and do some sightseeing around the nature preserves in Chasiv Yar, we'll fly back a bit late (international flight), meaning you might miss 2 days into the semester, but we don't anticipate there to be many problems going in, let me know if you would like to join us üíØ
Isn't there also an all female trip to Kabul and Kandahar this fall break too?
the one on coventry seems sketch to me based purely on the website like idk if I trust them to give you accurate aftercare advice
Do they need drone operators?
Isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a lobe piercing like the most basic level of piercing like if you been doing this how do u fuck it upüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
like you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really need to do as much research for a lobe piercer as for a body piercer. still good to get like a not completely dogshit piercing shop but the quality difference between mid range and high range is less noticeable just because they are pretty easy piercings and heal pretty fast
So he wants to shutdown the protest because people from outside case started showing up
apparently they stayed overnight
dont you know its a crime to sleep outside
I think we need a collaboration between KSl protesters and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not going way√¢‚Ç¨ guy in front of University Hospital
nothing like casepd having a thin blue line patch
it clearly states cwru admins are only allowed to shut down protests if they interfere with normal campus operations, but they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re on a lawn nobody uses and also there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no classes to disrupt bc finals
arent finals even more important than regular classes
i dont understand how anyone studies in ksl, its like trying to study in a lunchroom
His turn on the spirit wall now, apparently
This dude needs to stop sending emails
Palestine flag, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI dream of breaking the siege√¢‚Ç¨ with birds breaking free of a fence, bloody looking handmarks with tallies, CWRU student count vs child deaths in Gaza calling for a ceasfire, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCome Together in Peace√¢‚Ç¨ with a red fist, bloody handprints next to a chain link fence
because that seems like the typical protest material
Seems they found an excuse to take it down
probably he told maintanance staff to clean it up when it first appeared, but in typical maintance request fashion, it look a couple months
Not when you remember he doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t view Palestinians as human beings

Here it is, missed the story the 1st time
I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe they legit spray painted students wth
Yeah they were just standing by a few feet away watching as students were getting assaulted.
No, actually if they argue that they did not tell them to paint over the students, they are still liable. The very fact that CWRU PD was watching a few feet away and did nothing proves they may be responsible for damages. Because the contractor was acting as an agent of CWRU, CWRU is therefore for the liable for damages sustained to the students. @attiksh
Didn't know Wile E. Coyote was pro Palestine
you missed √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmentions participants serving student conduct violations√¢‚Ç¨ come on jarod it was in bold
buddy I did this in an airport on my phone after having to go through security again because I forgot to chug my water
one time i dumped my entire water bottle into a trash can cause i forgot before security
i still feel bad about it
The glazing over a president who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care about his students is crazy.
it's because Kaler cares about his students who are trying to study and not let a whole semester's hard work go to waste that he's trying to contain the disruption... you're delusional if you don't realize this
well, kaler cares about the bottom line, and that means he needs stusents paying moneyes
tbh it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a skill issue if it actually impacted your finals season
and alums/donors paying fat stacks
my favorite study space closed at 6pm bc of admin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s response but i still got As in my classes ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏
students and their actions cant fire him, as long as he continues doing the actions of the board he's set
Which is why he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s doing what the board wants him to yeah
dang it ended
well yea, schools closed, and everyones parents probably told em to get a move on to not miss thier flights
kaler is being petty enough he hired contacters to powerwash the chalk even tho it rained last night
Does anyone know what constitutes an "activity related to freedom of expression"? I'll be spending some time on campus and would hate to express an unsanctioned thought.
Does anyone know if we still have access to Wade?
nothing about that violates the freedom of expression policy
I'm trolling if you can't tell atp  üíÄ
ohh I didn't see that
ain't no way ALL Y'ALL THOUGHT I WAS SERIOUS
Not Cameron but some people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a sense of humor and would actually take you seriously
Although some staff and students did lose access to all bldgs when Kaler decided to lockdown so no promises
i can maybe check because i technically don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a housing assignment rn and yet i remain
We scored a 90 üò≠ . I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m never taking more credits than 17 anymore.
Not that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to graduation, but does this mean that I would need to get written approval in advance to wear a pride pin?
I can think of a few people who would feel threatened or intimidated by such an expression
Getting approval for freedom of expression is fucking crazy
If they clarify that pride is allowed that means they just want to discriminate against the Palestinian flag only, and no other flag
People will feel threatened by you
You will not be allowed inside
Lowkey disappointed I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t met either of you two yet
I emailed them for clarification, hope they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t try and student conduct process me
This is a hilariously stupid argument @.littlejimmy. But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not surprised you conjured something like this anyways to try to prove you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re right. 
The comparison between private university regulations and a homeless person breaking into someone's house is by far the most low IQ thing I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve read. Private institutions have the right to establish rules to maintain order and safety on their property, while breaking into someone's home violates their rights and puts you in genuine danger. Universities have a moral and ethical obligation to uphold their values. If CWRU wants to restrict freedom of speech and expression they need to come out and say that explicitly. What they are doing is just pretending like they have morals but also restricting students expression while at the same time saying they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. When people call them out on their bullshit, they say the speech is antisemitic and threatening to students.
So who are you to decide what constitutes as genuine danger and infringement of rights when the University's regulations clearly states that their priority is to maintain "The ordinary activities of the university" if not the University? Are we all just to be subjected to what you deem is right or wrong? Are your opinions above the University's and everyone else? What about the other students' rights to have peace and order at the ceremony that they've dedicated the past several years of their lives to? Just because you claim peaceful doesn't mean that violent events can't still occur, the chaotic nature of a protest implies that the participants have reached a point in their emotional reaction of the status quo that they feel the need to take action, so who's to guarantee that this wouldn't come out as an action that expresses malicious intentions to others or that violence wouldn't ensue? The classic "I don't agree with him so I'll resort to personal attacks" red herring really shows that you can't be logical in this situation and react purely on emotions
I ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reading all that. Either I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m happy for u or sorry that happened @.littlejimmy
Haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t read all of that but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll say this:
No one uses ksl oval lmao. They didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t disrupt university operations in any way. Kaler was the one who closed down the buildings on campus. Not to mention that sjp has tried numerous times to get on the table with Kaler and he refused to have a conversation.
if SJP gets to say whatever they want and do what is within their power so does kaler ü§∑ doesn't make it fair, but like that's just how it is
well kaler closed campus buildings because of the precedent set by other protests on other campuses, like Columbia. It wasn't an isolated incident, and regardless of whether it was caused by university or student protester actions, it only makes sense that buildings would be shut down to prevent uncontested protester occupation, which would lead to either offensive use of crowd control measures or overt student disciplinary measures (expulsions).
The current campus conflict has been difficult to be a part of, because it feels like you have to either stand for the university or with the protesters. I no longer feel that the protesters represent my ideals, yet if I stop supporting them then Kaler/admin won't change. Any non-polarized opinion gets stamped as opposition or drowned out as noise
Even if I also disagree with that argument we should still be respectful that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my take thoughüëç
Ong I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d die before I agree with Case admins fuck Case üòÇüñïüèºüñïüèº
Does anyone who has taken the mcat have recommendations of study materials? What did u find useful/not useful? I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to buy anything more than have to as many of the materials are pricey. Any information is appreciated. Thanks.
One of the donation boxes had mcat study materials üíÄ
https://www.studentdoctor.net/3-month-mcat-study-schedule/
Dont look at schedule, just the materials. Ive noticed people enjoy Princeton Review, Berkeley Review, Khan Academy due to AAMC association, Kaplan for content review, and Uworld
Dang just realized what red hand prints actually meant
I sincerely do not recommend Kaplan. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m being so fr pls just do uworld and blueprint and save the $2k that I wasted last year @sameyeam.
It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s overpriced and you get better quality full lengths and questions for way cheaper. Have you taken the exam yet Tyler lol
Bc a google search isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really gonna yield anything substantial compared to personal anecdotes
As much as forums suck due to bias, seeing a resource have a higher usage/sample size with positive reviews is more comforting than a resource that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s priced high with fewer reviews. (This isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t to say that Blueprint isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a top tier resource, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just that the stakes are higher cause of the cost)
Idk I just thought Kaplan wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worth the $2000 we spent ü§∑√¢‚Ç¨√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏ there are better resources out there that teach you the same stuff you need to know for the exam
Khan Academy is very helpful in learning for the exam but when it comes to actual MCAT practice you should be only using AAMC material
Also uworld is $300 for almost 3k practice qs and blueprint is $300 for 10 full lengths, a course, and 3000+ practice qs. You are getting way more for your money with 2 resources COMBINED compared to Kaplan. I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even touch the Kaplan books bc they sucked that bad imo and just reviewed by practicing questions and quizlet lowk
Im trying to figure out if i need it or not, I won kaplan for free through one of the clubs promotions so I have all their stuff already
If I have more idk if I can even finish that many
But quizlet bc I just don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like anki software and quizlet is easier for me personally bc I can use it on my phone
i did, no one joined in unfortunately
Idk if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Stockholm syndrome or what but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m starting to like Cleveland a lot
my friend's brother had a subaru outback where he took out the original speakers and replaced them with off market ones that had crazy subwoofers where if you wanted to listen to music you had the turn the volume all most all the way down or else your ear drums would fucking explode
weezer at 7 AM in front of the hospital
Depends. What year is it? Is it a manual? Most importantly what do you want out of it? Do you just want a daily driver? Do you want to go fast or do you just want to to tune it a little bit? Or do you just want it to look cool? I would drive it as is for a while and see what you dislike. Then start modding it. Civics and Hondas in general have a large fan base and aftermarket so whatever you decide to do with it there should be something out there for it. Also modding cars is expensive especially if you don't do the work urself
thinking 10/11 gen. itll prolly be auto. Want good mileage, fun, and reliability in that order. I think ill be doing checkups frequently and I take care of my car so i dont expect there to be too many user-induced neglect problems. it doesnt necessarily have to be a trackstar but I might take it to go clubbing or trips down south with friends on breaks and summer.
what the fuck was the poll  in #√™≈ì-announcements-√™≈ì üíÄ
I mean if that what you want keeping it stock might be the best option. You should only mod a car if you are unhappy with how it handles or looks, or if you have a specific build in mind. If you do any mod do the suspension. DONT slam/coiloveror, put rubber band, tires, poly bushings, ect, on it b/c it will ruin the ride and increase the chances of breaking something. If you do anything I would start with nice sport tire, then do either sportier spring and struts, NOT coilovers, or add some aftermarket braces such as Strut bars. I would stay away from doing any major engine mods before tuning the suspension b/c Handling is more important than power in having fun. I would not do any major engine mods b/c they are a great way to destroy you gas mileage and reliability. If you do decide to tune the suspension I would recommend poking around on the civic/honda forum and taking a look at the grassroots racing forums
Also if you need help working on it I work on my own car and has a decent toolbox
They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not in this server anymore
Except they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything about it
maintenance is cheaper for the school than replacement. and by cheaper I mean they can spend longer wringing money from students for it
case is kind of broke
No no, broken utilities are actually a premium product.
neither of those came out of the endowment though
Here's cases 990 from 2022. the 2023 version is not available yet
but tl;dr if larry sears says "i'm giving X dollars to build this new building" then the university is legally required to use it for that, otherwise they would probably breach a contract. No one really donates to improving the dorms etc so the money to maintain facilities like that comes out of the endowment. There are universities with endowments per student (a useful metric considering the things we're worried about scale pretty much linearly with student population) literally **40 times larger** than case's.
the dorms aren't going to be in great shape and they can't just move money around to fix it
I do not want to think about how much that's going to cost
wow, they are getting tired of students bringing the "mini" fridge and they are desperate to get more tuition money
i'm putting my money on building code
Or saving energy costs. Smaller and newer (more efficient) fridges can save them money in the long run
in that case, cleaning them dryers would save energy costs
v5 got a new washer dryer combo because one literaly melted internally and it was so nice for about 2 weeks. It didnt have a removable link catch, so like no one emptied it. I took like a rag and emptied it before i used it and it was a massive hairball
well, i thought i had it, but i cant find it in camera roll
it had like a digital screen. kinda fancy. i also don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a picture. i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t live there.
idk if i have access they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re using it as guest housing
Oh really? I thought they were completely closed
kids these days have no idea how hard life used to be. these minifridges will make weak and cowardly adults
Those kids are getting worse by the year :pensiveok:
there was someone shitting in the common areas in tyler this past year
better late than never to offload him and bring someone new in
It's probably a bad idea to swap unfortunately
Would it really be worse than having a dementia patient for president?
I think we should elect a DOG for president bark bark bark
wtf is the difference between room and board and on campus housing
yeah idk. i had a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìroom & board√¢‚Ç¨ budgeted for $2000 but that was summer aid for my housing? i knew where that came from
I mean I opted out off summer aid tho
Fair - case charging sm for absolutely nothing is insane
mine just said how much the grant was even though my housing cost was $2695, which exceeds the grant

Can your candidate do 20 pushups? Bench press 225? Squat 395? Clean 300?
I don't think so.
There's a reason why Jimmy Carter got swept in the 1980 elections, your candidate can't even extract hostages out of Iran. Does your candidate descend from political royalty?
Correction: Your candidate *tried* to perform an extraction out of Iran and got 8 of our servicemen killed.

How many images do you need to do

What are the easiest STEM courses at CWRU? For a premed who doesn't know what to take in their final semester
If they see you take 100 level courses your last semester and that course isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a required course it will just look bad
take-home canvas exams straight out of the slides or guest lectures; it's almost pathetic how little they vet the actual teaching agenda/curriculum. This would definitely be on the intensity of BIOL215/216/BIOC308 if it wasn't for the nature of the exams and extra credit
I was lucky I had a parallel BIOC class that was essentially microbio. BIOL 343 grade is easy because frankly you can just use your "resources" during the online exam that she lets you use. I wouldn't say you can't study for it, but you have to invest a lot of time if you want to do the exam un-assisted with no notes
anyone took Game Theory class?
apparently it's very fun with sheremeta
