rip message history
I’m British and I don’t care this much about tea.
Smh my head
Hold up lemme go to my computer
if not, you will need someone with a higher power
dont tell me what to DO
We can’t let Carly in trouble, so we blame it all on Julia.
do nothing
But the message history is gone
yeah trust me y’all I’m mad too
siblings, nothing but evil
And I almost forgot
All the pinned messages r gone
because she went to leave the chat and accidentally deleted it
idk albert
Oh she left the server
What happened to general
gone, reduced to atoms
Carly happened
Did someone delete general 😳
dw, boba is still as confusing as before
oh
Don’t fucking do this
what ever happened to green
we should hold a funeral service for the dead chat
ok well sorry im not a computer god im just a stupid NURSE
bc for the longest time ive wanted a crab rave meme but all the crabs are not there and it just says "cancer is gone"
if someone can make that pls
what the fuck
Cancer is gone 🦀
i will cut you
ok so um I just want to apologize about the deletion of general, I feel super guilty for it (even though it wasn’t me lol) 🥺😭
You didn’t do anything Julia. It’s not a big deal anyway.
i honestly don't even know what we pinned in general
it’s all good carly wasn’t being a meanie and trying to crush our dreams
i want to see your hot face also albert
If I can find it in my meme folder FRKN
i don't wanna do work anymore
i don't get the point
Then don’t
that barely wants to take her ap exams
some people have never grown from a bath
i never was into pokemans, but looking at their current games
oh yeah they're just farming for money
rip
and then they beat the dead horse
The new one sucks
And then make the piece of shit that is sns
okay i like sns because of the sick haircuts
the sword hair cut
fuck it ill drop out and get impregnated
sorry the standards are high here
so currently my school is like, we aint cancelling prom
but we dont care!
Guess you’ll die
or well i wont
cuz frick prom
the prom theme should be releated to death
lol, i aint paying 100 to go stand in a room with shite food
and now they are saying we wont graduate you till we can have an actual ceremony
which suck, i really wanted them to skip it
cuz i aint dying to wear a robe
I didn’t even go to graduation
they need to suck up as much of our life as they can before its too late for them
im dead
apparently it going to be the peak of their life
Extended senior prank: no college
Noo don’t say that
if we dont go back to case in the fall i am going to
lose my marbles.
I’ll also find miss rona and beat her up 💅🏼
Like losing our senior year sucks but I can get over it as long as we can actually go to college
I feel like by that point there will be a vaccine
Oh jeez
although idk how true that is, i did a project on vaccines and they usually dont take that long but idk it may have something to do w the nature of the virus
whoever ate that bat: fuck you.
the thing is is that like things need to reopen bc the economy wont be able to handle this and like the government can only give out so much money
i dont know much about economics tho so i cant rly speak to it all that much
Yeah that’s why I don’t see this lasting until 2022 even if it needs to
social distancing also doesnt mean quarantining
like social distancing will most likely last a lot longer than quarantining
u already know that ppl are only gonna here "u can go outside"
Yeah that’s the problem I feel like people aren’t disciplined enough to follow through with it
*yall forgetting, the reason the spanish flu went away was because it mutated and everyone was either immune or dead*
with advancements in medical, i dont think that this is going to reach the same heights
If they don't develop a vaccine fast enough they will just allow it to spread to develop herd immunity.
For someone who did ap econ, would you recommend doing intro to micro/macro again?
I got a 5 on both the macro and micro exam and I know I will be
Dont want to make it more difficult
Was boring as shit
You know what, I hate Albert?
Well guess what, I never loved u Ben
My Econ teacher last year hated my class
Shit got deep
and theres an episode of a restaurant like 5 min away from me
@spacemanboris how does adam feel about albert tho
Well, if you imagined bad, you're correct.
Get out while you still can!
okay y'all so apparently there's this anime that did terribly so the just handed it to america and went "do whatever u want"
How bad?
Idk
It just didnt do well
But the dubbed peeps dont give a shit and said random stuff
oh did she put the wrong number
4 people left the server
people do be leaving the server
they scared
I'd be scared
By cured do you mean dead? 👀
yall spending your money on lsd, and you giving it away
What just happened
@beckck  no do not retake the intro class
@spartan010 what u doing on tinder tho 😳
@beth9746 It’s been a year since I’ve taken micro or macro should I retake the intro classes?
So I’m getting a laptop
and I am wondering if I will have trouble at Case if I have a Mac rather than PC
Unless you completely forgot all of micro. CWRU is a micro based program so ap macro is only helpful for intermediate macro
@beth9746 should there be a preference  in laptop I have (windows v Mac) or does it not matter
But I haven’t used my laptop for more than writing papers, excel, PowerPoint etc
Yeah I am going into computer science and either works
I am “in class” but it’s basic game theory so bored
Idk I AP out
But I have seen the lecture slides and it’s not bad
Econ classes aren’t bad
Oh right that one test
General for grad school
Yeah engineering is most computer software heavy
He just takes my laptop
It doesn't matter what computer you use imo. It may be easier to use a windows based computer for engineers, but as long as you are on windows or mac, you shouldn't have any issues. They have cloud based engineering programs like SolidWorks, etc. that run slower than if you had a dedicated GPU in your laptop, but people manage just fine. For everyone else tho, just use a computer that you want to use. Don't overthink it.
u need that speedy rendering
Ain't leaving this baby behind
I got that generic ikea desk tho
@lunativity I’m bored as fuck in quarantine and they added a feature so u can talk to ppl all over the world so idk I just got nothing better to do
albert is also horny as fuck
Used to have one of their mice then it broke
Idk I literally have nothing better to do so
there's this pen pal app i got recently
but I haven't actually used it
your poor penpal
I need this sort of excitement in my life
he really said no school till may 15th
others cant
I can sympathize with them and know that it’s a shitty situation for them while also feeling like crap rn
This isn’t an ideal situation for anyone
i recently got into a game called crossout where u have to build a war car and fight
Don't be
I’m no longer confused
Did you know that like 3% of the wood produced in a year is consumed by Ikea alone?
I don't buy furniture unless its extremely flammable.
lay low and they won't notice
I could spend all day in an ikea and not get bored.
I need those arrows on the ground
i feel like running a brothel within an ikea would work
the arrows on the ground are designed to get you lost
the meatballs are better than drugs tho
Don't get in the way of me and my swedish meatballs
I’m sorry Ben🥺
Big brain shit
those cells will eventially die
What if u eat the cancer tho
And leave the rest
stomach cancer? I do be producing my own food doe
Big brain shit
then you have no need to eat
I’m already a cancer 😎
This kid last year named his English project neez duts
and the teacher never knew
Oh...
As long as u stay 6 feet away
@spartan010 how does that work
you would essenstially need another heart for that
Just the last foot
a med student would be better to answer these kinds of problems
so, med students, how much blood would be needed, and how large the heart?
Nah he not supposed to be within six feet remember
albert's erection do deplete his total body supply of blood doe
did u know the ds is foldable because the designers couldnt find another way to make it surve being run over
go for it, i'm going to need a 20 page report with an abstract by tomorrow
Cali was the mission now we leaving
Shit
you weren't supposed to tell
one of these days i will get nitro so i dont have to copy paste emotes
Nitro isnt worth it anymore
I have it only cause I got grandfathered
since im grandfathered I get it for 50 for one more year
Oh
cuz not all thonks are create equal
too late m8
I’m sorry but I’m not sure if you have a good night man I gotta is that the one that time is going on and I’m like a little worried that you have a lot better and I gotta was the way you wanted me to go to get into boba I gotta get you to know
and they dont need nitro
shit you got me 😭😭
Bc cmon now I want My own godam bathroom@
the way dorms work is i own all of them and rent them out at 1k per day
can we compromise at the fair price of one rib
yea gater, i think ur sol, the thing i though might be seems to just be empty wall?
Shit dawg
Also wtf
I want raw cookie dough rn
now i want raw cookie dough 🥺😔
Someone stop me from craving foods i cant have
I feel your pain
miss corona needs to gtfo i want cookie dough
sugar cookies though 👀
I’ve never had it before
It tastes like whatever type of  cookies the dough is for but it isnt warm and the texture is kind of pastey? Someone back me up
cold soft cookie
You're not really supposed to eat it.
if i die by eating cookie dough.... so be it
"IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!" -Sarah, shortly before dying of cookie dough poisoning
honestly though
Death by Cookie
if someone died that way i would have 100% more respect for them
End it all
The bad part of the cookie dough is the raw eggs so.....
can u even die from raw egg
Idk but its nasty
That's what's bad about Cookie Dough
I know someone who had it, but she’s okay now
idk if you wanna catch anything bc even if its not serious people will think you have corona
and there wont be assistance for you bc you wont be priority
Last one to get salmonella from raw eggs wins a million dollars.
Or the last person in the server?
yeah but why would i have raw cookie dough without the danger aspect of it
the yolk really adds flavor and personality
that means u can make one up whenever u want
i wanted my middle name to be leedle
Either would work
idk
zigo is kinda quirky tho
always last in the alphabetical lines 😔
I was never the line leader 🙈🙈
Fuck those people
OMG LUNA 😭💀
What's wrong with Beilis?
does it work
how do i get one of those without asking for it
this is why we can’t have nice things jonathan
idk i say a lot of things i don't mean
okay it's hard to explain
me: I am going to beat you to death
me: I hate myself
idk i just can't see someone being able to stand me for long periods of times
fuck it
cooties are worse than miss rona 💅🏼
that's fair
bruh if my parents have ONE more college talk.
Imma run away
Come to north carolina, nobody goes to college here
Baby don’t hurt me
don’t hurt me
i am going to hurt you if u continue talking
so idk
Don't hurt me
but i don't think my parents are compatible
can u still be my roommate if u drop out
I’ll still pay for housing
*college
actually its not really the marriage. it's just that they themselves are people who would never really fit in a marriage properly
like my dad gets frustrated bc my mom is stupid sometimes
I've lost track of this conversation
Finding someone who wants a relationship in college is tough
my dad kinda needs a relationship to survive but at the same time a marriage infringes on his way of life. My mom on the other hands would function totally fine independently and would properly thrive more but it's really the only natural instinct of loneliness and desiring for a partner that made her get intothe marriage
oh also i'm delusioned by the concept of being with someone and have too many crushes to count
oh
jk idk why i gave him consent
luna, Chris evans though🥺😳
But it'll be wrong
i don't think chris evans is that attractive
Friendship: Ended
from a guy perspective chris evans is conventionally like very polished attractive but aesthetically he doesn't stand/ pop out
I can’t blame you
how do u guys feel about timothee chalamet
I don’t like timothee that much 😳
Wtf
I can’t 😔
but u believe u cant have it
And still want it
haven't seen that episode
ok fair
okay we aint getting a real answer smh
this reminds me of a novel i read when i was reall young about a girl who spent her summer in a vacation house with her aunt or something. Her major goal was to find extremely genuine love. There was a fairly cute boy she met and became friends what but she just couldn't get herself to fall in love. She also befriended a dog and became really close with it and by the end she realized she loved the dog so she did find love lol.
I would fuck ryan reynolds
Except I'm not gay
Don't @me
ryan reynolds isn't that attractive it's just the humor
But he’s still hot
like i dont' see it that much
I don't know what makes a male attractive
Fuck my life
ryan gosling is ugly sorry
no fr there's something wrong with his face
@jujulb i dont know
idk what i hate about it
Chris Pine omg
tom holland will suck my dick, not the other way around
What’s wrong w dat
was a pain to get to class but great to watch him
Listen guys I'm a solid 7/10 apparently
But my sense of humor brings it down to at most a 4/10
Henry Golding looks weird
Tom hardy isn’t that
she still is
my dad doesn't look like keanu reeves
idk
I don't understand this conversation right now?
w8 does this make sense: some characters that actors play are hot/attractive but the actor isn't
Cuz it’s their characters too
Omg
how do y'all feel about zendaya
zendaya is like conventionally literally flawless in terms of beauty but for some reason she isn't exactly my type
omg albert 🙈🙈
can’t relate
Yeah, I didn't need to know that albert.
bruh don't do the asian community like that @spartan010
I honestly don’t rly find scarjo attractive
Alexandra daddarios eyes tho
scarjo isn't attractive to me either
Isn't rwby American?
ok daddario eyes hit diff but she doesnt do it for me overall
oh
Fair
oh
you know you have senioritis when you cant write a 1 page reflection on a comic book
Sometimes I don’t
but in total her look isnt that unique
Damn you got me
i think she's kinda pretty but like her characters suck ass
Things have gone downhill quickly
arent they dating
isla fischer is hotter tho
hmm i think isla si like more conventionally hot than amy but i still prefer amy
nah they dont look the same
amy isnt necessarily hot just super pretty
i guess i dont care about cuteness
idk u can just tell
but doesn't it depend on the person
but isn't rly pretty
omg
omg maddy 💀💀💀
Damn
Short
idk
i dont think theyre attractive
hollywood aint my style
hiccup with the helmet tho
Maddy you chose the right school
Fuck!

Goodbye 👋
Has anyone committed yet?
I’m still deciding between case and Santa Clara. Both for CS
someone at my school is looking at the exact same schools
Any current students here? I have a question. Someone told my dad that there’s a pretty bad drug scene at case. Is this true?
Idk. My dad told me that someone told him that a lot of people from out city came back cause they got addicted to drugs
ah, so ohio has a heroin problem, however, thats mostly down south and the bad bits of town
But like there aren’t any major drug(like proper drug) problem; right?

I feel sorry for the clones
I wish order 66 wouldn’t happen
those made me feel even more bad for the clones

I haven’t watched rebels
the comic in general doesn't have much to do with rebels but it shows kanan experiencing the death of his master and his two former clone commanders hunting him down

I didn’t watch solo
Leave some for the rest of us
u cant tell me im wrong
Yet
well, youll lose it all when everything opens up and people start moving and grooving again
idk who had a link to it
i dont have the link of your class's groupme
yeahhh me and my roomate never talked
Doing well, got a shit ton of work to do but that’s just not happening today
that takes me back
remember when creeper aw man wasn’t a meme and the song wasn’t a meme
Nah don’t remember that sadly, I think I stopped watching after like the first pixelmon  series they all did
I miss those days everything was so much easier
yet ive never played minecraft lmao
uk its been a week
but im still in disbelief that u go to the same school as bikram
I’m still stunned
the same exact thing happened w a Bikram and another friend
dude i dont remember much abt bikram but like
I didn’t talk to him much until this year which i regret because he’s a good friend
he’s insanely hard working and smart
damn that’s like the farthest you can move in the country lmao
Both my parents went to UCONN !
like how it had a community feel in a big school
but the end of the day it doesnt beat the community feel at case and the overall vibe here
damn
oh did you get in EA
which makes sense since its a private school
My mom wanted me to go to case so bad she told me even if I got into ivies she’d prefer me at case
he was so passionate about the school and he really got me interested in applying lol
yeah the community seems less toxic than what I’ve heard at other schools
idk it sucks that i had to go through all this work to end up at case but like
Like other group chats I’ve been in have been dead
BECK OH NO
damn thought i was bout to spend the night in the car lmaoooooo
wouldn’t have been too bad lol bc it’s like already morning
I spent a summer at my cousin’s house and we locked ourselves out so we had to move the car and my oldest cousin had to climb into the second floor window
@beckck how did u find this server
trying to get college advice
u dont text people like that
wtf
you can’t predict these things,  so don’t stress just do you
apply to 10+ places so u dont regret not applying to a certain place
apply to ur dreams but go for 30-40% acceptance rate range so that u dont just end up at state school
though I kinda feel for the kid on a certain level of his parents are pressuring him to go to a certain prestige or he’s a failure
like my parents had this whole phase freshman and sophomore year where I had to go to an Ivy
ahhh that sucks man im sorry :((( idk my parents just have never really been hard on me w college
they dont even know where i applied to this day LMFAOOOO
I purposefully excluded my college app details to my parents lmaoo
Roman’s post* sorry
dude i havent used reddit in so long
IM CRYING
GOOFY IS MY DOG 😭😭😭
BRUH IM CRYING LMFAO
U REALLY
I DIDNT MEAN TO
what gave it away
apparently i give off boy vibes idek bruh
All my friends thought I skipped a grade because I was short😞
mine was all just like college posts and shit
i was probably annoying then
like they’re not bad or controversial they’re just cringe
like I look back and I’m like what is wrong w me
college
but i look back at it and im just like damn
some dude commented “so r u saying that u applied to this school without knowing anything abt it and asking for our help”
Shit

SHANNON OMG
IM SORRY THAT YALLS WERE ONE OF MY SAFETY SCHOOLS LMFAOOO
LMFAO IM CRYING
IT WAS SO BAD
I WAS LIKE WHALE SHIT
IM GETTING A LOTTA HATE
OH MA GOD LMFAO IM CRYING
TELL ME IM WRONG
OH NAHHHH
dude i found some kid from my school on some subreddits
it was the funniest shit ever bc i confronted him abt it during the school year and he was so flustered
oh shit it wasn’t 50 sorry
It was 15 wow my memory is bad
Like he said 4-6 hours PER WEEK for national honor society
IM IN SNHS AND I HAVE SPENT 1 HOUR PER MONTH FOR THAT CLUB
IM DEAD
I was sitting at my phone as I read it kept getting worse and worse
Lemme find it
I can’t find it
damn acc?
What does “damn acc?” mean I’m sorry my brain is not working
It’s late for me and I’m 3 hrs earlier
damn actuallt
bruh thats mad annoying
seriously that’s ridiculously hard to get
I’m excited to leave but I’m gonna miss Austin
My dad just woke up for work
I just realized it is 6:30
Nah I  wanted to see how many downvoted I could get
I think I got 2.4k upvotes? I can’t remember the exact number
I feel like there are better college tours on students’ YouTube channel
I thought cases wasn’t too bad, but the issue is that they’re so staged
I can’t even navigate through the case virtual tour
no finals now for school
but I still have to try THIS MAKRING PERIOD reb;ihsxbskdjzab;axbj
luna you’ve achieved the dream I desperately want
my final is making a video walking through a math problem khan acadamy style
bruh i want an automatic 100
Automatic 100s? Damn
my professor fucked up our chemistry quiz an hour ago and removed the submit button basically from our quiz in the middle of taking it
Btw can’t you cheat on an online test?
depends on the class
some of my professors are making us install something for our finals that monitors our eyes on the screen and records us while we take the exam
like yea.. u can.. i would feel bad if i did tho
Damn bruh
idrc i feel like its reasonable
like i do be needed this knowledge for my job in the future if i dont know it i dont deserve to do well
Idk
*and nothing else*
I need to commit soon
Oh
yall still in highschool
why can’t we just learn to be in college smh
Why does undergrad even exist. Just let me go to med school already ://
why does school even exist. just let me into the workforce already
tired of education
medicine doesn’t work
it’s just in your head
Oh gotcha
There’s a mod tho right
Ngl I forgot what it was colleg
College?
hate stat tho
agreed, stats suck
We still aren’t even close to finishing the curriculum
i am going to shit, fart, piss, and cum in your pants
ah what happened?
lmao i had a math quiz today
and supposedly u cant cheat bc he made us take it on zoom
but i legit was on my phone the ENTIRE time and got a 92 and i literally laughed my ass off
also hella shit went down in the ru server lmaooo
What happened there?
Oh
i broke up w this guy bc he was being toxic
Lmfaooo wtf
and then this other kid left
and then me my mans and all the other trespassers had to leave
so we all had to leave
they have beef w the guy who left bc he crushed on a gal that my friend liked and caused hella beef
is it still going on?
not on mine though
Damn bruh
I feel that
so I look like a bad guy from those videos you watch about identity theft and internet safety
I wanna hug a fatass pikachu
I want it to sit on me
Do you guys think this will really happen?
i mean they didn't explicitly promise anything, so I don't know
and I don't think school's will be completely open in the fall
in the summer, researchers predict the heat will drive the contagion down and things will start to open agian. but with the fall weather, there will be another surge of infections
most likely we will experience the next wave, but again that's based on research done throughout the start of this year. there's still plenty of time for more work and prevention and maybe even controlled and produced protection
As an international, it’ll be a pain in the ass for me
It might but p sure nothing is known yet
I think at the worst schools will start in January
(Even though most semesters end late Jan)
@akumaenjeru i dont but i heard it from my grandpa, so i can try to get it from him for you
so at least things won’t be normal till second semester
Idk
Yeah i cried once just thinking about taking a gap year, it's just never been in my life plan
I haven’t cried in a few years but I might now
Who else wants to cry with me?
Also I don’t think that’s what their email said yesterday
idk?? i feel like nurses may be forced to if we r missing so many clinical hours???
i took more credits than i was supposed to be im assuming it will be online lol
also bc the online class i wanted hasnt opened up yet so 😠
Honestly I would if my parents didn’t force me not to
I wouldn’t except to be in class
i dont think u apply for a gap year? i think that if ur like on the cusp of getting in theyre like "oh we can offer u admission for the next yr but not this yr"
its been a while since i applied 😪
how tf do all three of my strikers get injured what the fuck
It’s weird I feel tried rn
But the earliest I’ve gone to bed in the last week has been 5
Goddamnit I picked the wrong fucking year to take a gap year
also beck thats a fat mood
mannn I wish I could watch that all for the first time again
i like how theres so many plot lines and depth to it
I need to get into the show
Yo shit what if I dyed my hair grey
Honestly I just want change
Don’t give in Albert
Don’t become someone who spontaneously dyes their hair bc quarantine
I’m growing mine out atm
My mom offered to just do a buzz cut
But then realized I look kinda shit w them
the best part about my longer hair is I don’t have to comb it and it looks pretty decent
I think I’ve grown it long enough so that it’s too heavy to do that tho
Like I don’t look bad considering I did absolutely nothing to fix it up
im rlly tryna dye my hair im so bored
I wore when I was working out
Idk about dying my hair
I don’t think I’d like it
i feel like u could pull off highlights or something
But I just want to mix it up
but im just bored LOL
ive been eating like shit this quarantine
Somehow I don’t rly have too much of a problem with acne
Which is crazy cuz I treat myself like shit
Honestly I don’t notice it Shannon
No u don’t
I’m actually considering dying my hair now
But now I’m like what the worst that happen
I think that’s I thing idk how hairy dying works
Fuck highlights
Idk yet
So there’s still a little black
Honestly I don’t know shit about hair lmfaoo
Honestly idk shit about hair either
Idk it seems like a pain cuz to get that color I’d have to bleach it
But like I read it’s really easy to fuck up
it doesnt matter as much for guys though? it’ll just grow out and u can cut it after
But it would be a few months at least
like until it grew out to get it cut
I gotta cut my hair too, my side and back hair is way too long and annoying asf
i want like lavender hair or something
My friends have told me to start it tho
I see so many asian dudes with middles parts tho
But I don’t think my hair is long enough yet
But my hair is still kinda short relatively speaking
My forehead is too big tho
Hold the fuck up I look like a clown
programming makes me hate life rn
its due at midnight
Oh
So low key if you want me to take a look
yeahhhh i cant do that
Yea true I guess recursion is kinda fucking slow
the real question is if i get 3 hours of sleep or keep working
oop too late
if that isnt a mood idk what is HAHA
so i guess im just not sleeping??
When is it due?
soooo 18 hours?
How much programs are left?
uhhh not too much i gotta fix this weird situation i got myself into and then program my testing and run time but that shouldnt be tooooo bad
too late
I’m getting bored rn
do i tell my parents i didnt sleep... hmmm
i feel like they would be upset but school
I feel like it would be obvious
Aren't your eyes red
i did school work
In other news, Dont play any source games for a bit
i use dark mode for everything except coding
idk i like the colors
Mine doesn’t
It doesn’t have dark mode
might fuck around and graduate on animal crossing 😳😳
Isn’t animal crossing for kids?
(Apparently)
bad sleep schedule is one cause of weight gain so ur on the right path
😤😤😤 I do be using my terrible living habits for good doe
I don’t think I’d want one, but how easy is it to get a single as a first year? i’m assuming pretty hard.
Not that hard for the single
Honestly I’d want that rather than starting online
if y'alls schools aint p/f what are they doing instead?
killing me
so if you fail you can just make up some work in the summer
stinky head 👇
and im in IB so all the exams are cancelled
Why is this stuck in my head I’ve literally never even listened to it
@addat do u want late gang role
I don’t wanna scroll back up
School*
So basically this spread like wildfire bc no one has anything to do, and then the legacies tried to like fight back, which only led to more uproar. It isn't much but this one girl started denying that she went our when she posted her out w friends on her MAIN SNAP STORY. Then people got even angry.
basically people were pissed that they were going out and when they got called out they got really pissed off
LMFAO IM DEAD
something similar happened w my school today
Damn that’s crazy roshan
like this all happened and I was thinking "damn need to tell shannon this lmao"
it wasnt specifically targetted but we all know who it was aimed at
shit was hilarious
Yea same this happened with my school
READ THIS SHIT
my grades are 600 ppl so thats what i was thinking and im like oh thats not that bad
they featured some kids who dont go to our high school too who were part of their gang at jams 💀💀
Clout be overrated tho
Now my mom is mad
that's valid tho, you got 8 hours
my dad's birthday is tomorrow so i need to wake up early
this is not a choice anymore
i was playing minecraft and lost track of time
yea idk why people are legit protesting lmao
Cuz they’re idiots
The most thing is them conservatives saying they won’t be controlled by something invisible
honestly America aint all that
like i admit that i have not followed the quarantine. but i deadass dont leave the house and the only interaction is that my bf comes to my house and we watch tv together so we’re endangering each other ig but no one else bc we both literally just stay at home
sad so say im a part of the loner gang as well :((
oh god i dont want to publicize that
Omg
LMAO IF U RLLY WANT THE ROLE I GOTCHU
Roman is a poopoo head tho
sarah and luna are also admin but cant give admin to other peeps
It’s never loopus
I was worried no one was gonna get it

It wasn’t anything like “ omg wow “ about the movie
Ugh it’s amazing

Shannon did they really
my school is having an online "secs es bad bad" talk, im ded
its sex is bad bad
the point still stands, who is having sex rn except for alabama, everyone is stuck at home
Ask her why sex is bad
her answer*because dicks are bad*
i get that they are trying to prevent people going crazy in college, but in my case *pun not intended* its a nerd school
this is true, but it isnt a party school
i mean if you wanna find a party you can find one but not as often as other schools
instead of telling ppl.... that sex is bad... why dont they just teach.... methods for safe sex.....
Can someone tell me why I slept for 11 hours
body tired
i havent slept yet
I FUCKING THOUGHT IT WAS 1999
I READ IT WRONG
It’s ok it’s like it never happened
In 2024 when we get to go to school on campus
LMFAO IM DYING
why can’t I count
I am formally announcing that I will no longer participate in the counting channel
I’m so sad
hi so sad, im @howdy_.
*i didnt realize you could @ yourself
uh oh
oh
u can’t count
“Can’t count”
if I wasn’t stoopid I wouldn’t have issue lol
ok mood tho
looks like somebody's parents paid $$$
your parents paid me money at the sperm bank
well that sucks for me ig
Also illegal methods don't scare me anymore, I've been desensitized because I'm used to all the error messages my code keeps getting
what is case admitted the wrong Roshan Desai :cursed_flushed:
Idk bruh I’m pretty stupid dunno why they’d take me
Ur pretty smart tho so it can’t be true

Personally, I've been trying to go to Paterson for spring break for years but its just too expensive
I’m still deciding between schools
My dad used to work there, but then Quest moved to Secaucus.
I mean you’re not wrong
Idk what to feel
@rtd5598  ooh UMich vs CWRU I have an anecdote: The head of my poker group graduated as a 
junior from CWRU to do Statistics at UMich grad.

He hated CWRU the 1st year and was super depressed but he found his friends to room with and started vibing. He visits literally every weekend he can so I can only assume he's either having trouble letting go of CWRU or isn't finding bonds in UMich. I'll ask what he thinks about UMich for you
Damn
i just realized indiana is right next to ohio so if i go to purdue i do be kinda close doe
if illinois didn't have land touching the great lakes they would be kinda worthless doe
Don’t worry I’m already craving death
ahhhh roshan dont leave us
doing homework makes more sense at 12 am
i swear the schools are losing it without students
"Don't eat or inject yourself with disinfectant, warns FDA commissioner"
i mean, how else am i supposed to be 100% sanitized
if i dont inject the gel right into my veins
ah, so he wants the scientists to find a way to inject disinfectant, not just straight up inject some purell
still dumb, less malicious
uh oh
i play overwatch tho
I didn’t just wake up in the middle of the night
nope, not at all
idk who even thought about that
but r u really
I can’t lie and say that I’m still not super tired 😔
I WILL NEVER SLEEP AT THAT PLACE
I just missed her I guess
It's not that bad rn, Saturday is the day I get bluetooth setup and I'm highly intimidated
could be worse, we have a 16 person class but three were accused of cheating
I don't know, but from what I hear the committee that takes care of academic integrity hasn't met since quarantine started
It's just the weirdest class ever, we're encouraged to copy and paste some of our code off the internet (like a real programmer ig), but with other parts the teacher is super strict
Thankfully, I'm allowed to copy and paste most of my bluetooth code. Lots of area for error tho, it's code for both the phone and the raspberry pi so that's like two times the chances of someting bad happening.
They don’t think it be like it is, but it do
e-learning is getting worse :(
My friend at uiuc dropped all of his online classes, so now everyone but him is taking final exams and he's just sitting around gaming
Are online classes that bad?
If you're good at self study then I guess it wouldn't be that bad
Hmm. I’ve yet to commit to case. On my portal there’s an option to to take a gap year/semester
I woke up 10 minutes late to one of my online tests lol
Ron i feel that i woke up 15 minutes late for a quiz but it all worked out i think
could've been an invitation to bomb a zoom class
I’m not sick 😳

Oh, you think the coop is your ally. But you merely adopted the coop. 
I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the backyard until I was already a cock, but by then it was nothing to me but nesting! The chickens betray you, because they belong to me!
isnt a coop where u overthrow people
congrats, goodbye $500

Same still have to commit
I have trouble going to sleep if I’ve just woken up a couple hours earlier

My mom wants to start a zoom call with cwru ‘24 parents 💀💀
omg.... iconic
Well if your parents are interested, she genuinely wants to do it (pls don’t tell them)
And @jujulb there is parents and family orientation. Why don’t you tell them about it.
She just wants to get to know the parents beforehand 😳
Oh fuck no
Shit
As long as it matches up they shouldn’t care I think
Like they dont currently know that U took a subject test?
I don’t think so
so if u got accepted already they don’t mean much...right
I mean if they don’t know
Yea so no need
Cuz u already got accepted without them
And you don’t get credit for them or anything
Bruh I feel that tho my parents be the same way
my dad just calls me four eyes and takes my glasses off my face
But it only ends up fucking the kid up more lmfaoo
Omg is this what hope feels like?
On campus college? 😍😍
Don’t crush our hope like that Beth 😭
lol, case wants ur monies, they wouldnt tell the truth if that could lose them $$
My parents just told me that they won’t let me go abroad this fall
I don’t think colleges will accept deferred acceptance cause someone doesn’t wants to do online classes
No students no college

im confused with what theyre doing w sages for u guys tho
ive heard that theyre taking it away but idk
noooo don't take away sages
bc its a 4 yr thing i feel like they wouldnt take the whole thing away??
Why are they taking it away?
Why are they taking away sages)
i dont know if they are
cuz phuc humanities, all my homies hate hummanities
i dont think they are bc i cant find anything online that says theyre taking it away
Humanities shit
Like English classes and shit
Uhhh I already hate it
Ugh
Imagine participating in class
Couldn’t be me
foundations is different tho
you need to take 3 semesters of sages classes
Oh
Oh dope
YOU FUCKING LEGEND I COHLD KISS UOU
and my teacher got me a gift and wrote me a rly nice note even tho he never showed emotion 🥺
but if u wanna think ahead try and take an fsna bc the usnas go first in registration for other ppl who still need to take sages and theyre really hard to get
latin at my school is a joke, aparently in ap latin half the class is just sleeping on the floor and the other half is playing smash and the teacher generally just plays smash
Smash be a vibe tho

And apparently you’re the only one with it

gromit says go to bed
I went to drink water and my grandma was really happy that I woke up so early
Idk just thought it was weird how we both knew her even tho we live on like opposite sides of the country and she’s in Taiwan lol
I feel sorry for her tho cuz she started NYU in like January and then covid19 happened so she spent like a month total at college 😔
I think it's sort of mentally exponential, like you know someone with a 11 is waaaaaaay worse than someone with a 75

I hate physics (I say as I take C2)
I barely got a b in ap physics 1
I haven't had a good science teacher since freshman year, unless you count comp sci
And ye, my physics teacher also sucks. She doesn’t do anything other than showing us her solutions
it sucks
one of my friends.... forgot to take a final exam...... F
rip
"my power went out and i havent been able to reach you or take the exam at all today"
might work if he didnt send any emails or messages
however, they could claim, why didnt you reach out through data
they cant prove he does
I've been trapped inside this cage for ages
just helped my friend do that final that he missed
i got my last big final tomorrow lol
oh right, r u committed yet?
Speaking of committing crimes, skipping my physics class today 🤮
@bravo5127 Sure thing! I didn't think I would enjoy playing League when I started so I made my name as terrible as I could while still getting a laugh out of it

Has no one seen the communism is like rain vine
Do I have to link this shit
I'm realizing that. Please make sure I never major in philosophy

IIRC your school is supposed to do that when they are released, if they also sent your recs and transcripts from previous years
Just woke up from a 10 hours sleep
Still feel tired
Sigh

Tbh I didn’t get sns
Because honestly the game looks terrible graphically
My favorites probably still platinum
And reload my save if I didn’t catch it
Can’t go wrong w them
The issue is that game freak keeps producing these games, yet people like me always buy them, so they’ll just keep making money 😳😳
Omg yea heart gold is probably my second fav
Tbh I haven’t played botw either
I have to give sns credit though, the wild area was a really cool feature in the game; I just wish they did more with it
I wish SnS actually made use of the things that they put in place
Made you cry as she laughed and stepped all over you
I wish Cynthia stepped on me

The melt on campus isn’t as good as the one by the cvs
immediately went there
I was supposed to go there
Like it’s really sad to say but it did
i was just sad because i didn't get to talk to sandy like i usually do
And I was supposed to go there with her
I want Tommy’s
never too much ice cream howdy
@a.u.bohac anything you can think of adding/stuff i forgot?
i'm just sad that campbells left lakewood
also isn't happy dog closed now or something?
everythings closed
*you know, due to the global pandemic*
i miss my parents having a costco membership but
this is how we scare people away
I don’t see the problem 😉
it's by no means pure though
u never know
yea, grey goose is branded as kirkland and sold on the shelves for like 1/2 price
i want the kirkland shirt
No lmao I wish
costco is huge, but their ceo doesnt make astronomical figures, its alot, but not like stupid more than you could ever spend money
the Costco near me is always a shit show 😔
where my mom bought $850 in groceries to last us the next month due to quarentine
i'm not eligible for one yet qq
NEVER GO ON FRIDAYS SATURDAYS OR SUNDAYS
that's how you die via car accident or something worse
Chris have you been to the Wayne one? It’s near the Wayne zoo
omg
I hate willowbrook
It’s the actual worst
Wayne is a plague, and willowbrook just makes it worse
Is it bad?
you can’t go on the weekends
I don’t even bother going there for gas
this is the funniest shit i've ever seen
damn the Wayne ones looks tame in this streetview
the images were taken at very different times
@jujulb this is even't as bad as willowbrook gets tho
and that is why I don’t get gas at Costco
there's a quikcheck gas station near it
last I was there
never a line
if I'm anywhere near it I go to get gas there
although I hate route 46 with a passion
46 is the actual worst
how do you ruin a highway so bad
I don't even have to get out of the car
esp when it’s cold out 🤢
although waiting for the people to make their rounds can be a bit annoying
it's ok Julia, you can't get ignored if you're the one pumping
I need recommendations for shows / anime to watch
I need a break from my computer
fuckkkkk I don't wanna pay for hulu
Yea I stopped s2
shit is so good
Cowboy bebop is the shit too
Ahhhh I still haven’t finished it
I started episode 1 like 2 weeks ago and completely forgot to keep watching lol
tell me this intro doesn't slap
My percussion teacher is so disappointed I haven’t finished
All percussion players are either high class technique ppl or absolute gremlins
haven't
I wish I had no thoughts
now i dont get it
that made a resurgence on tiktok unfortunately
I’ve been on a nostalgia trip for the last 2 weeks
It’s a horrible endless cycle of skydoesminecraft, anime openers, and vocaloids
mood minecraft videos used to be my shit
then it died
But apparently they’re back??
i want the controversies >:((
but apparently his ex gf was crazy
he lost all of his money due to sexual assault allegations or something
i’m bad at it all i do is hit random buttons
But I suck ass at it
carly owns the game card but she doesnt let me play because ill ruin her personal win streak
im SO bad
I think I tried to play wii fit trainer once
The miis suck
Controlling a character that can go so many places in so many directions is so hard
Donkey Kong’s recovery kinda sucks tho
Personally I can’t use a character without a large vertical recovery because I fucking suck ass at smash
unfortunately 😭
that’s why everyone hates tom nook
Or like variable rate shit.
Fixed rate is when the interest rate stays constant for the whole loan
Nah I’m a broke boi
Cuz I fucking suck
That also came out wrong
If there’s any year to take a gap year tho, it’s this one
im taking a gap year
online idk yet
I'm doing online classes now for highschool and they suck
I don't want to think abt collegiate level classes online
Also idk if I could find motivation
Also I don’t want to live with my parents for another year lol
I just don't want to be in Cleveland living in a lockdown when I could just do it at home
Yea that’s fair
+ I want to start off on the right note
i don't understand dis shit
but I do want an ok grade
It don’t rly matter
and this damn 4.5 gpa won't maintain itself
idk how that works
I don’t think our school did weighted
Also we didn’t have ap classes
I went to a rly small private school
I'm at a public school 😳
idk my grade is like a little less than 500 kids
shit is ***dumb***
We didn’t even have ap classes
We just had honors classes for math and science
Tbh idk what I’m even trying to say here lol
idk either
shit is stressful
But we’re in college now so none of that matters
College is supposed to be so much better than hs
the urban dictionary definition of CWRU doesn't sound promising though
The people who don’t like the place are going to be the loudest
There are so many ppl shit talking it
Especially since college is supposed to be where you find your interests, and where it’s going to be the easiest to find people who share the same interests as you
i still need to make the other ones oop
My mistake was that I started my gap year and all my friends left for college
Do you have any ideas of what you’d want to do?
As long as you have shit to do
But I can’t get weed rn 😡
awh damn
what other emotes did yall want again
OMG SARAH
I’m sorry
I’m sorry pls let me back in 😔😔
No sorry! 💅🏼

well I’m feeling generous today so you both can come into the bunker
she needs to be bigger idk how to make her bigger
Damn that’s not bad Sarah
Shit
make a cocktail tha fuck
Uhh if anyone else wants to I’d be down
Don’t judge my terrible taste
Or apple juice idk
My parents aren’t exactly big drinkers
What is classified as hard all
Shit
Yea fair
also my parents don't care
My dad doesn’t care
But my mom is low key conservative as shit
But now that I’m accepted by a college they’ve chilled out a ton
And so they’re like super studious and shit
Oh dope
My parents used to live in San Fran too
Look at this shit
they’re closed 😭
never
fuck i forgot there’s a pandemic going on
It has to be authentic tho or it tastes like shit
It’s fucking hard to make xiaolongbao
My mom can’t even make it well
DONT VISIT ME.
I won't visit then...
I’m not trying to say anything 😔
good bc I was about to get mad >:{
Oof don’t talk shit about ur own ppl
the only towns we can shit on are verona, nutley and clifton
What wrong w playing soccer
hold on Julia u wanna see some fuck shit someone published in the paper here
and true and very bad
and then there's the last letter in page
makes me sick
he's lucky he didn't get intent to distribute with 500 bags
well shit he did
Either way it’s pretty bad
that didn't speak any english
i mean, my school hired a teacher got fired from harvard cuz she was sleeping with students in turn for higher grades
the school systems are fucked
Damn, the school systems are worse than I thought
My high school also fired a teacher last year who sexual assaulted a student
im a bad influence sorry albert
smh my head
dunno which one, argentina is kinda secluded
Didn’t they lose the emu war
poor dog
Poor dog
Omg I don’t wanna jinx it but....
no one leave 😡 (pls)
If u leave ima ban u :banhammer:
I need to demote myself 😞 man not allowed I’m stinky
I don’t need to be admin (again)
i guess as long as u support gromit u can stay
I didn’t say that
and I want sleep
my crossed ass needs it rn
I came here to update and also complain @wuhoo4158 didn’t follow through and I’m disappointed
Roman just took it away
Sorry man
smh my head
now I’m really gonna sleep
can’t make gainz without proper sleep
Where is the late night gang and why am i always asleep when theyre active and awake when theyre not
There’s a swim team and shit
idk man
i haven't done anything as far as college stuff
Also I heard it’s best to get the basic meal plan cuz u won’t rly need it
I think I’m gonna go for unlimited even though I don’t eat a lot, it’s only $100 more, and seems like it has lots more swipes
I really gotta try to stay on top of this shit lmao 😅  I'm too forgetful
dunno
Lemme find it
seems to be the start
but i have a very suspicious feeling, case is going online
the survey so they can match roommates it seems
dunno tbh
and wont make sense until 3years later
honestly u dont need unlimited swipes unless u rly eat 3 meals a day 7 meals a week
i never ran out of swipes with the 17 per week
bc filling out the survey to find a roommate isnt required for everyone, but case does require u to put in basic living information in ur housing app
esp if u want to take cold stuff so u dont have to go to the dining hall everyday. like cereal
technically ur not supposed to but plenty of ppl do
my friend group has stolen the mini m&ms from leutner a bunch of times. so much that they stopped putting them out
Don’t get unlimited unless you have low food standards
i usually didnt eat at leutner, when i used my swipes i used the special swipes at dunkin or the den and i used regular swipes at the hec cafe and big cafeteria
rip fribley
My bad bro kinda new to discord

What if the bot turned you on
I know that they say cwru isn't a relatively competitive school, but you better watch out when ben and I are choosing dorm rooms
Fuck
So if u work w your roommate
And some people want to live in quad
My math is not wrong right I haven’t done math in so long I think i might have forgotten how
Cuz you’re both trying to get in
So if you both are trying to login on the website at the same time
The probability you won’t get in is 73%, and same for him, so for both it’s 0.73 squared right
Yea fair
there's another math problem I'm genuinely interested in:
I guess you can think of a roommates in a pair?
esp cause you already know who they are by the time you choose hoising
Cuz there are still the same number of rooms but the num of ppl is halved?
Oh shit u right
1) your parents live near the school
here's the math problem:
it's more complicated tho
so I've been thinking about this for about six hours now
Tho
Imagine not being able to marry cause your law requires males to be 21 before marrying
Smh my head
why is it capped at 32 chars, ugh
Might need to use ur phone
oh
No I will not use my mod powers for evil any longer
Nah only you don’t listen to country
Country isn’t in the top
Americans are poor tho, we're in the middle of a recession after all
No money

And streaming sales have gone up
Oh

Smh my head
That makes it worse lol
School is officially over
time to crack open a cold one
except sparkling water can choke
its due to cornona, and that im a senior
fuck you instruction
the school should be more like Fuck you baltimore
usually we end that late, but the calendar was changed this year
ours just... didn't
school boards everywhere are mentally incapacitated
early August
but how do we end
and since im a sneior, i dont have any classes
I'm also attempting to write a code segment for my computer science class and it won't work and I'm going to break my PC
or cry
This is what I need when coding
I would also need to be isolated as to not punch anything else
Bc i need friends who are gonna be in my classes bc my ideal way to study is in groups
Nope sorry
We still could have overlap
I may do a cs class or 2 idk tho
i dont know how it would work
bruh 4 hours of hunting
WHY CAN'T NJ HAVE NICE THINGS
aw frick, its already snowing here
this is why we all can't have nice things
Oh if you guys are complaining about snow you aren’t even READY for Cleveland weather
*very lightly, but still*
It’s apparently snowing in Ann Arbor too:cursed_flushed:
rip
apparently tmrw we need to brace for
bold of you to assume cleveland has weather beside gray
except massive
Weather
If the weather could be a person, it would be a REALLY angry baby throwing a temper tantrum
I need it
get one of those duck kazoos and blow real hard
the reason they say senior photos dont work
and that wouldnt work
But I go to a prep school so I’m forced to wear a coat and tie
sucks to suck oof
DONT YOU
OH FFS
Do you go to a public school?
Go away
I don’t have a good picture of mine
Sad times
you didnt take senior photos?
We don’t have stuff like that
white, and hates minorities
no shit
and the other is funded by grants and $30,000 tuition and doesnt have to pay taxes
I went to public school and turned out absolutely fine
#1/2 in the nation public tho 😗✌️
hold I have an important image to sum up my school experience
quality sucks
there’s asbestos at literally every single school in NJ
yeah that’s bad
I hated my school
but now I miss it and the constant bullshit
yeah Wayne valley isn’t anything special either
people rip the fire alarms out of the bathroom ceilings to vape
the whackest shit at mhs
was the RIP juiceworld trubute
people shit in the hallway at wv too
Idk we had an active shooter on campus, or at least the threat of one
so we were in lockdown for 2 1/2 hours
Unfortunately, we’ve had stuff like that too 🥺😔
it’s so scary 😭
my math teacher did LMAO
hold on I need to find a picture
ugh my calc teacher is GROSS
guy on the left
you hate it how i call my male calc teacher chick
Except for country roads, which is a meme.
go study
don't even get me started abt the Wayne DMV
i dont like to remember my driver's test
the wayne dmv is an utter shit show, i know
ah fair
FUCKING SHIT
uh oh
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT
the only times ive been to the dmv, i was with my driving instructor so we just went past all the lines
this was for the updated license tho
I have 3 days with nothing to do but this and government
so i can still technically drive with only 1 other person
i know, i didnt listen to that law in the first place anyways
i always drove with more people than i was supposed to
i already cough all the fucking time
lol I dont
i vowed to not drive like my dad
25 is too slow for me though
ok i dont go 25
miss me with that
that makes me want to put a bullet thru my brain
i die
inside

Cuz I don’t have a middle name

But now I can't see what they say 😦
ok so your ap bio score doesnt do anything
Oh so..9
Oh credit filler
Ok and can ap exams place you out of gen Ed's?
I mean sorry calc 1
if you place out of calc 1 with say an AP score or proficeincy exam, you dont need to take it
tho it is recommended you take it
SAGES is just a requirement by the school. You can't escape it
Ok wtf

Apparently in the state of California it’s illegal to have a name that isn’t in the 26 letters of the alphabet
12. HARRIET
"If Icelandic parents want to give their children a name that isn’t listed in their National Register of Persons, they can pay a fee and apply for government approval. In addition to not being a potential source of humiliation, the name must also meet criteria that’s more specific to Iceland. It can only include letters in the Icelandic alphabet and must be able to conform to the language grammatically.

One family was unable to renew their daughter Harriet’s passport because her name can’t be conjugated in Icelandic. Her brother Duncan also had a banned name (there’s no letter C in the Icelandic alphabet), and the children instead must carry passports that list their names as “Girl” and “Boy.” "

the whole store
I don’t understand boba 😭😭
Isn’t milk cap the foamed milk they put on top?
My strategy when i'm indecisive about flavors is i go for the more unique thing that i dont think i could get anywhere else
yeah idk why they’re like wet gummies
There’s nothing like it
sorry

wtf is that
I want some gushers
fruit rollups highkey went off
Those used to be the shit in middle school
And elementary school
fruit snacks tho

Isn’t that tru for every campus tho?
Yea there’s certain bathrooms on certain floors you don’t go to unless ur smoking
I don’t use public bathrooms on Principle
That couldn’t be me
I’ve never tried using a urinal
Who’s crying about mechanics tmr??
CWRU campus doesn’t really smell like weed except some dorms
Is/has anyone in here taken the placement calc 3 test for CWRU?
To force students to take their math
Crap. I really don’t want to repeat multivariate again tho. Should I suck it up and take the class again or just grind on the test
You should always take the test if you want to
I’m a biochem major, and I’m planning on minoring in math or something (or econ)
I think you need up to diff eqs
I haven’t taken math since junior year I’ll probably start beginner level anyway 😔
I’m still convinced Carly escaped Area 51 and she’s just wearing human skin
But I didn’t say that
oh my god she’s gonna go nuts
You’re already ahead in math so I wouldn’t be concerned
why didnt u take math this year?
I got straight up nyc despite never having lived there in my life
Apparently no one calls it “the devil is beating his wife” (when it’s raining and sunny)
What a sad phrase that is
I feel like in Chicago there’s a difference between north side and south side
I was trying to phrase that as pc as possible
I tried to use Linux to get purble place on my chromebook but gave up
but y tho
Honestly my hp spectre is supposed to be better but it ain’t
I can’t play Minecraft
Chromebooks suck bc no steam
I do have a Radeon gpu tho
They’re a piece of shit
I like Apple but would never buy a Mac
My school gave iPads
i have my own macbook, but my school won’t let me bring it 🤢
i dont know how google did it
Even with a discount I don’t want a Mac
Should I get a new laptop
Because the spectre sucks
Yee, I traded in my first iPhone (4s), and my old iPad which I cracked years ago and used the student discount and got nearly 25 percent off the price
i'd need some stuff like budget, screen size, etc, but i can do it
infact i still do
You cant run GTA or hitman 2 tho 😦
I suffered through that shit for ms and hs
Omg I want a list too
The last thing I gamed on was hp smth desktop from 2010
Well isn’t the intel hd chips abilities dependent on the cpu? What’s ur cpu @howdy_.
So ig my headphones are superior to my laptop rip
Omg I think I had a 520 too
Well crap how do you run any triple A titles?

choc covered popsorn tho
Oh so true Welch’s or nothing
Was gone in 2.5 weeks of college
Annie’s omg
I was never allowed vitamin gummies are they really that bad
Why have I never had Annie’s fruit snacks
More gummy tho
is cuz he goes the the 2nd most bojee school in cleveland
and you cant tell me im wrong m8
Hawkins school
If you are posh and want to dress like it you should save the environment
Patagonia doesn’t fit me, their sizing was strange. Vvines fits me rlly well
my bio teacher gave us metal straws at the end of the school year last year to help with recycling
Either they’re too long or they squeeze my shoulders to the point when I try to lift my arms I feel like my grandma is hugging me
Metal straws are the single worst thing to happen to this world
Clothes that feel like a warm hug
I hate metal straws
I feel like though if you are truly pretentious you got to have ray bands
I’m a hoodie w nothing under type of person
I don’t use ray bands cuz when I was trying then on, they were to big on my face and made me look like a blind man
Tshirts. Smh. Real ones don’t wear anything
guess I’m fake then 😭🙈
My fencing coach hates me because I never wear jackets 😔
And I wonder why I get sick but I digress
As I said, Patagonia anything never fit me
Oh if I’m cold enough I’ll double up but I understand
Lordofmemes I am sorry
I forgot you are the president of this discord
So if it does not work for you
I don’t discriminate
It cannot work for us all
Sweaters can be skin tight which can suck
But sweaters are more compact and don’t have a good
it seems you are at an impasse
Someone tried mugging me inside my car while I was parked at a gas station (I was getting directions)
How bad is east cle really?
It’s just a very poor and like neglected neighborhood
@howdy_. I was using my phone but I’m not about to pull out my phone while I’m driving
and as such, it didnt get the infrastructer it needed
it's also its own city, so it can't get as much support from cleveland proper
Oh so it’s a neglected suburb?
ye, i cant say i've gone to take pictures there
I flunked my ib Chinese test and I feel so free
I wasn’t planning on doing Chinese after graduation that’s why I didn’t work too hard on the test
let alone something sle
if their vanilla is bad, then they arent putting effort into the basics
Hate vanilla ice cream tho so I’ll just take a chance on a flavor and hope it’s good
I haven’t had honey nut
I don’t remember what I got when I went to Mitchell’s
Bad or good?
i dont get vegan ice cream, they just dont tast good imo
its a poor subsitute I guess
cleveland vegan might still be around i can't remember
I want townhall rn
pretty sure they closed so rip
i dont even know if west side market is open
I miss west side
i mean just keep your wits about you; don't get lost
emphasis on don't get lost
ive never been
Like honestly if you are bored and don’t want to go bowling
Honestly at this point if I’m bored I just nap because I need to get out of sleep debt
dunno
and how much we need it
i still wonder what caused it
Ew the west side. All my East siders hate em
as if you walk about 15min away, everything flips
It’s like when people move out of downtown and go near the south side and they’re amazed bc it’s not all high rises
I’m surprised that I haven’t seen any major moves for gentrifying the south side
there is some last i checked
but ther stereotype of being "the worst place in the world"
is still alive
Like they tried to get lake shore extensions but gave up
Michigan Ave isn’t a neighborhood
Evanston isn’t even that nice tho
Yea when I went to cle it was weird bc it didn’t feel city enough to me
its cuz we dont have 2h traffic on i95
Well i mean you can drive 20 miles from downtown and can milk a cow. Cleveland isn't a big city lmao
The traffic is one of the many downsides of a big city
Ok but on I-90 there's a lot of traffic between 4-7
imagine that traffic
worse
I hate going downtown esp when it’s warm bc everyone’s on that mile
I dont know why but University of chicago kept sending me stuff to apply there
when i  am like the opposite of what they want
My sister mostly hates it there but it’s bc she’s anthropology in the midst of business and econ
Yea she went in undecided and realized too late that maybe doing anthropology isn’t a good idea at uchi
The mac n cheese bagel smacked hard
Well no the einstein in nord sold Naked and other stuff too
don’t even try and tell me that any bagel that isn’t from ny or nj is good
CWRU is pretty bad
Okay that explains why I’ve never been, not much of a bagel person
I’m sorry but you can’t
I’m telling my parents to mail me bagels from home
That’s so much work
so I don’t really care
Oh snap!
I miss cle
This is a sad day
Cle sucks but also it grows on you
I've lived here all my life and I hate it tho
Cavs games are boring
Owo I’ve never had that before
never heard of them
we dont even have a foot ball thing
Actually tho I went with my friend to a browns game
we dont know how it got there
the browns are the reason i stopped watching football
Is leaving this gc
sorry to be a wiseass but
i need one of those
during school
i just don't like how cleveland has the dolans and the haslams
no tuition, title 1 is for the dumb, poor, and druggies
Mine doesn't
Holy shit
Nope
only if your school gets title 1 funding
but that doesnt happen much
I missed that
bruh i didn’t realize all schools didn’t have free breakfast
they like force us to take it idk why
private schools come from a time where the rich didnt want the "unpure blacks" to ruin their childs education
i dont know for ur school
u need to hit those numbers to recieve the $
cleveland has a long history of this
Yea they gave me a chromebook even tho I got one bc grant money
well my school hates its students so we don’t really get anything 😳
Ugh I hate looking at Chicago maps over time
and why the bus only goes so far
S. Euclid is basically lyndhurst and it's not THAT bad
God that took forever but yea obv my school is title 1
and learned about the scam that is the american school system
My mom is on the lsc so sometimes I’ll hear abt it but I also don’t pay that much attention
school
holy fuck this conversation went crazy
Rip in advance
however, i'd would do it in a microwave u want to use
For all of my supposed brand loyalty to Apple I do not pay attention to or care for whatever they do
I don’t understand why people would want do art with an iPad or Mac but to each their own
apparently drawing tablets are hard to use bc u can’t rlly see where exactly ur pen is at
Because I would’ve taken them
Maybe sold them
personally i would never share anything that went in someone's ears. Idk i'm a germophobe that way
If I happened to find a box of AirPods however...it’s free game
bruh king of finding lost airpods
If someone shit on a $100 bill and left it idk if I could do it
Like I’m not the type the only want crisp bills but plz don’t give me a wet bill I’d cry
/ugh/
Never
damn
and broke their pinkie
It was like, not the worst
wish I had one 😔
you need to get those tail fins
i don’t even think i know how to swim right
i just flail my arms and legs and hope i don’t drown
I learned to swim near competitively but it’s been like 8 years since so idk if I got the moves
My parents wanted me to join the swim team
It sucks b/c my times were so close to being D3 😦
Ew running is bad
I want to die
i tried track but i was too short to do the hurdle warm ups so i had to warm up over invisible hurdles 😔
Awww

I want shake shack

it doesnt seem all that different than mickey ds
ok am I the only one who doesn’t like shake shack 😳
Don’t care for the burgers much but the fries n milkshake are decent
I get so sick 😭
hasnt made me sick tho
thats a rip
I get sick whenever I eat fast food though 🥺
The only time I got sick was when I had the extra spicy wings at Bdubs
eating fast food makes me feel kinda yucky but i’m also lazy
youve never been sick?
Five guys brings me pain, it’s delicious but pain
it was an april thing (and ive already used it)
and they gave nothing
I’ve never fw chipotle
that’s the only fast food that doesn’t make me sick
and its not half bad
and its near campus
I’ll just go to a local taqueria if I want smth
bruh i want me some portillos 😩
bruh i want that cake shake
It’s hard times
Gosh please stop I’ll cry

I’m still trying to understand what this place is
I will cry Right Now

I miss rainbow cone
Dippin dots are the shit

I will die on this hill
Can’t agree w u on that one
We don’t even have in n out
Or west coast idk

why my brain gone fisho mode

I forgot you’re from Chicago mayor 😔

Ok it wasn’t spectacular
I stopped going to five guys for burgers
Hate chipotle
So like CWRU food is bad so chipotle is okay now
When i left we were talking about food and now we're back on it lmao
its not bad
but it isnt a god place
Never had one
Bye all I am going to go work
Bye

Oh

I was almost worried
But I need to do that before I go

Nope

I don’t bother going north unless I have actual business there
if you go down to the vet hospital, across from wade oval, i guy i know sells hotdogs
Sorry beth
Sad times
I’ve been to places that serve xiaolongbao but never got them

But if it’s not authentic it’ll prob suck
Oh lit

like the outside looks strange
I have never gone to a buffet willingly
Bambo garden or grill is bad
I sent the wrong link
i dont know why
I also only went once so idk
I’ve never been to a buffet that I liked
Actually don’t even know if it was called Indian flame but wasn’t a buffet
*why cant we be friends starts to play*
Oh over Luna’s
I have only been to Luna’s once tho
It’s a popular spot for college students
Didn’t know it was a date location
Oh yes, bc it's close to Coventry
Oh
*all i can think about when someone says grog*
I don’t know how to skip rocks
really?
It was sad
Idk how to skip stones either 🥺
y'all need some teaching
I learned but idk if I remember
Anyways there’s a reason why I only went on one date with him
OH SHIT
cuz he didnt teach you how to throw rocks
caveman hours out here
Uhh that wasn’t the main reason but ok
have something you want to share with the class?
Well the majority of the date I was crying because my life was in shambles
Oh I did
this dude seems like an asbolute joke
Then I couldn’t go on the second date
food poisoning sucks
Yeah idk dating at CWRU is rough for some
I think I just had bad luck
I'm already in a committed relatoinship
With my car
this is some my strange addiction shit
oh god, the poor exhast pipe
OH NO I DIDNT MEAN SEXUALLY
Def not a friendship either tho
Food isn't overrated
UGH
Anyone want to go to presti’s during Owen
Like actually tho
Oh during the whole Feast of the Coevenant, I got baddd diarrhea
But i ended up making more money than from my ACTUAL job
I don’t like alc that tastes like alc
Idk
I hate Prosecco
If I drink (which isn't often, only in social settings) I go hard or not at all
Also it keeps away the cold, and boy Cleveland can get cold
eh, we havent hit -40 yet
Oh they do too
i only drink 99% rubbing alcohol, it really gets you moving
speaking of fakes mine is so bad
it literally looks like a piece of shit like
idk how u do that bad
idk
i didnt do the order
Yeah those are bad
then you dont need dodgy ids
Yeah that won't end well
guess im a loser, rip me
I forgot her name
u honestly dont need one.
like it doesnt belong in the same sentence unless doesnt is in there
We don’t know her
Oh
i dont know enough math to know
Isn’t theta also a math symbol?
Ah gotchu. She's a close friend of mine and fellow alcoholic
greek letters werent always math symbols doe
I mean if you want to party at CWRU you can.
If you don’t then you don’t
It’s one of the only schools where you will not feel left out if you don’t
i forgot we have to do that
cuz im down to hear ur ideas
Sadly
Forgot to apply
You don’t have to go some activities
A sudden spring cold
i didnt
Idk if orientation will be the same
and i didnt go to that one either
100% case is not going to announce school is online next year till its too late
i feel like if they announce it it will probably be like in august at least
My brother has decided to live in cle and my parents think he is the shit
Idk? Lol
oh*
I don’t associate with my brother
For 2 weeks
that sucks
Yet my parents encourage me to go clubbing
what did the poor seals ever do to you????
No room n board tho
if the school cuts tuition they will be losing money out the wazoo
Luckily CWRU sports don’t bring in $$
So we don’t lose as much $ as some schools
so we arent losing anything on that front lol
Pros of a nerd school
Except for nursing it sucks
Can’t miss smth I never had
That’s what’s keeping me from the big sad
fair enough
but we aint gonna do labs, so why charge us for em
You still have labs
i didnt go to casino night either lol that was on my birthday too!!
Because of finals
just jokes I would be a really bad gambler
I didn’t want to be disturbed
Don’t have anything to gamble with
I’m very bad at secret hitler, ask anyone
thats exactly what someone who wants to be good at secret hitler would say
im sorry but have u PLAYED spoons
It’s stupid funny
Rip
rip
society aint gonna be normal for a while probs
that doesnt mean quarantine for 2 yrs tho
Idk I was out at Eton (outdoor shopping mall) and there were ppl milling abt without masks
Eton is also 5 mins away from me bud
I want a cle against the world mask
^ok fair
I'm just more pissed about research at Case
cant wait 2 go back 2 my classes in da building that was a surge hospital
They’re still doing research
mad respect for the nursing majors
I’d b so sad if I can’t go
If I already have my cpr cert would I still have to do that?
omg
Rip meg
i had certification but u still have to
Oh fuck yea
CPR do b tiring tho
and u need 2 sems of pe to graduate
Rip
Stupid Ohio
Never thought anything bad abt her
depends on the pe class
Whatever you want
i always wanted to learn ballet 😩
Never again
I have May term tm rip
self defense omg
i tried to do krav maga in hs but i had basketball practice whenever it met
I want to take self defense but I feel like when I actually need it I’ll just rely on brute strength
Because I am also working 16 hours
if you feel like it’s too much for you rn 🥺 theres always next yr may term right
bc nurses schedules r so tight that u cant even minor without either overloading credits or taking summer courses
Oh Fr
Man I wanted to minor in childhood studies
Oh nvm then
I don’t remember
and then i have just enough room in my schedule junior year to take the other 2 soci classes required for the minor
An A isn’t 90+
If you go to CWRU and don’t know a bio major
Booo I really want that childhood studies minor
i dunno whether i should do b.s. or b.a.
Depends if you want to double major
Pre med bio is really popular
Ba you need 90 credit hours in art and science
like idk if bs would look better for med school but the website says that ba is recommended for pre professional students?
music minor doesn’t need the college requirements
none of it matters. Your major doesn't matter (though you do have a higher chance with a more relevant major); BS/BA doesn't matter either (unless you don't get into med school). Think of it like this: pick your major based off of what YOU want, not what you think Med Schools want. If you don't get into med school, then yeah you will have an easier time finding a job with a BS in Bio than a BA in bio.
Yeah idk what bme does to ppl
Except will
sorry that was very abrupt lol
it's possible i think, tho what's wrong with just going biochem lol
Who the fuck is Sarah tonin and why do I need them
isnt that the sleep on
i thought that was the feel good neurotransmitter
who is sarah tonin and why is she never in my head 🙈

oh phew
I hate Mechanics
i need mellon tonic
I still have 25% of mechanics left to review which is the worst part
But idk if it even helps
Tho I guess I shouldn’t be one to talk
Shannon isn’t it like midnight for you
My sleep is slowly getting fucked
my mom wont wake up to feed me
Bruh that looks fucking lit
Good shit

Same because I took them all last year and I am in college
because roman hates me
lmfao im only taking 1 ap exam, which i still didnt study for and didnt give a shit :D
Wtf Roman did you do = tag
It’s okay Shannon I did study for my ap physics until a day before and passed
im taking calc bc tmr
funny cuz im a math major and everyone expects that ik what im doing, but i rlllly dont

i didnt study at all
i feel like it’ll be fine i’m just scared like... they say it’s one/two questions so wtf are they gonna ask
i’m taking an L on my physics test thursday
i took physics 1 alg based last year lmfao
and then literally wrote a note to the exam people that idk what im doing

i hate english of all kinds but that was fun lowkey
i literally have known the discord peeps for the longest time but idk what yalls are majoring in 😂😭😭
You could make some roles so you don’t have to remember😅
The AP mechanics AP exam was BULL SHIT
oh deadass
my school pays for them
(Not me but still)
We don’t have APs at our school. So we can only study for them after our finals are over
So we have like a month to study for the APs(from scratch)
Lol you suck it up. I paid like 1400 in AP’s
Damn
bruh im dead 2 of my friends both took the ap exam
My friend said that she didn’t have to use equations on hers
Like I didn’t mess it up Becuase I had a giant ass study sheet and looked up the answers but I momentarily had a mini brain hemmorage trying to figure it out
I had to use the torque and rotation equations for mine which sucks
My sister says that it’s basically gonna be a lot of harder questions crammed in the time that you can’t finish
My fav AP if you can have one, was bio lmao, easiest one I’ve ever taken
I took mine in 2017 (sophomore year) and that shit was a lot more than an ecosystem lmao
So college board is taking a political stance now 😆
calc is deadass the only exam im taking and ik im boutta fail
How much do you need to pass?
I think even a 4 on BC will get you credits
theyre 45 min exams, there is no subscore
You need 5’s for Case to count it. 4’s won’t get you anything
i took the mechanics exam just now and i couldnt submit either of my responses
i tried pdf as well
I did the copy and paste and I didn’t have issues
yes, but i also tried copy paste and that didn't work either
Didn’t the college board say you had to disable all addons and extensions before you submit ur files?
i dont think i tried submitting images
i didnt see anything about add ons
@.eyc idk but when I turned mine off it let me submit. I also briefly recall my teacher telling me grammarly and other addons were blacklisted
I disabled everything for chrome and it worked a treat. But rip
i had no idea addons were even supposed to be turned off
Idk one of my teachers mentioned it and I followed suit
dude there's no way they can stop math cheating
they just need to bust like 10 rings or schemes for publicity
doesn't matter if they're all on one test
frankly doesn't matter if they're real
they just need a press release
all i heard was don't have grammarly turned on
well, gl, im not taking any aps, so i'm gonna sleep in
i almost forgot i had an interview at 12
Probs gna be online now tho
but they need any help they can get
I stayed up all night when to sleep at 8  and my mom woke me up in a Panic at 12 I’ve never moved so fast
Had to put on business casual and do my hair and not look dead
@mootdoot which hospital? The Vet?
I’m slow I thought you meant local as in CWRU local
Northwestern was such an asshole to me I hate them
the school or the location
School, when I applied
ah, they seemed interested, but i couldnt imagine dealing with week long parties
there’s also a groupme but the groupme is scary
groupme is a cluster fuck if you have a group with over 50 people
Ok fair, I rarely open that chat
is it just left over from a time before?
dunno never tried
However bots can still overflow them and make it worse
and groupme keeps some anonymity like ppl don’t like giving out their number to random ppl i guess
I just suck at snapchat
Fair, also on an unrelated note my snap had the numbers 666 and 69 in it!!! Big milestone
yeah maybe i just suck at snap too
Sarah you send me cat videos, you do not suck at snapchat
sure beth i don’t think i have u on snap tho what’s ur @
i lost a 700 day one with my sister and gave up forever
Sarah I would cry
I suck at streaks
You cry about a lot of things Julia
I lost a 500 one with my cousin and cried so I had to stop doing streaks
I can’t help myself 😭😭
that doesnt do anything
I don't know how snapchat exists
They lose a billion dollars every year
It baffles me how you can do that and still function
its all a bunch of fake internet points to increase ur epeen
nothing more
I haven't gotten a lazy eye photo
ben I promise you, you don’t wanna see it
Eh, She's not alone in that
Fuckin' hate 'em.
i’m just playing with u i wish that would work for me
I have my second exam in an hour
And boarding school
I CANT STOPSNANANJA
IM SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNIFNDNSNJS
I’m literally gonna lose it
fair
Which bond movie tho
i need to finish some coding work
but yt keeps distracting
And need to rewatch like 40 mins of it
isnt there a new bond movie or was it delayed
dunno
oh no
ur braincells are gone
the last name would probably change too tho
isnt jamie a chef dude?
Fuck
so instead of blacklisting a role that many people have
FUCK
suck for u tho
Wtf happened to the server

We're all inside Zucc's head
It didn’t work
I'm still here
I don't use this server?
beth I’m still upset 😭😭
23 minutes until exam time
if u need help, just alt tab over here and we will give you the worst advice
don’t take howdys advice college board knows all
I got a 5 on gov last year
college board is the thought police
they really are
if u for one second have a thought about a shared google doc u will die
i can’t tell if they’re like bluffing or if they somehow know
from a computer perpective, there is nothing they can do
I posted about the ap bio exam last year
I am not dead
the college board be talkin the talk but they cant walk the walk
but besides that they cant do nothing
Don’t confuse me anymore
Man we went from punishment kinks to college board and now to Area 51
ben go take ur test i’m calling college board
arent
Guess I'll go
well you cant argue that
I’ll leave
Well, Ima go take my exam now
Bye bye
i think he could get a 6 tho
I want a -3
a 9! those a super hard
so close to #1 😭😭
wasnt that newton
dude i literally have to take physics bc math major 😭😭
rip shannon
im legit soooo fucking bad at anything science LOL
physics is like math that lies
physics dont seem like science
im so thankful i never have to take biology again
its math with an identity crisis
I feel like physics is just math but only vectors
LMAO IM BAD AT CHEMISTRY AND BIO
math is like it do be... but u have to find it
Bio is by far the best class I’ve ever taken
Ecology was my shit
Too bad it bored the fuck out of me
couldnt be me
I would’ve gone for a run today but my boss called me and said I had to work 😦
I’m running away from the fact that I have 3 exams in a row this week
i'd think they would want everything done quickly
ik maybe it’s bc ppl still getting off waitlists and such
I don’t want to be the only commuter in this
i dont get as much fin aid if i commute
and since im already taking out loans
ik, im trying to get a solo room just to spite them
plus, i dont have a car
woudl be a pain
the saying "its expensive to be poor" is v true when it comes to many things
Except you have to share bathrooms so idk how that works
fuck
rip
Why do people hate on me when I say I like a nickel back song
Ok fair
Nickleback isn't as bad as people say
One of these kids I’m tutoring right now is playing dubstep and I don’t have the heart to tell him to turn it off because he’s jamming out and head banging and crap
But I HATE edm
Music taste isn’t trash, just some artists
I can’t apply my western music theory to my talking drum it just wouldn’t work rip
Music theory is cool but hearing the terms one, four, five seven chords thrown about make my head hurt
I also hate the aural stuff in theory
Major/minor can be subjective don’t expect me to know
you dont always notice it but theres 47 time changes
On the last note
Okay but Mary had a little lamb in a minor key sounds scary
Oh fair, chords are harder
I’m good at theory on paper but I can’t apply it
Oh viva la vida I haven’t heard that in forever
oh and paradise
forgot about that one
Oh snap I didn’t kno those were Coldplay
theyre not that bad, idk why people hate on them so much
Idk if they count as true alt tho they can create some pop shit
like whens the last time you ever saw someone do this
i never understood vocals tho i guess
like imo vocals cant make a song good except for sylistically. like ever never heard someone sing and be like damn theyre a lot better than other singers, therefore this song is good
My music taste is fucking everywhere so I don’t even know
I can like, rank singers by quality, but it doesn’t always factor into me liking songs
the one exception i think i have is muse, which has both great music and vocals, but theyre getting to be more electronic/pop lately sadly
Too bad muse went to the poopy recently
yeah its really sad
same with weezer tho tbh
good for people who like vocals tho i guess
FOB is my shit
Except mania
There’s not a single song on there that sucks
not as many ppl know of them tho
I'm working
I’m watching the last kingdom
oh ?
Bro now that I’m clean shaven
Oh
😳 nothing
But yea sometimes but I don’t rly eat cucumbers Enough for it to be a common problem
i want more
u always havent made enough
well, thats all my trailmix gone
cut it in half
i want
Same tho
Boutta make me act up, damn
I’ve never had one of these
Bro I fucking feel like Ron from parks and rec
You can’t make pizza bagels in a toaster because the cheese melts quickly and can ruin the toaster
clearly u havent been desperate enough for pizza bagels
Never had pizza bagels before
Mom says they’re too unhealthy
then it doesnt taste good
So she doesn’t always win
sadly the aldi brand doesnt have the same spice
Woah I didn’t know aldi had a generic brand
Oh I think ik what
Those never fail me
too much air
However Cheetos puffs suck
i need my chip to have T H I C C C R O N C H
and they arent even considered chips
Man I haven’t had Pringle’s in forever
apparently they're "biscuits"
probably cuz there is no potato at all in pringles
Omg fr
i don't like having beet red finges
also I'm not worried abt the exam at all
@.0.0.0._ wtf i literally wanna hug the shit outta ur pupper
i want to hug anyone's pet
No one wanna hug me tho 😔
just dont be stupid enough to post on reddit LOL
@wuhoo4158 ugh same, i'm so screwed for BC Calc
I just found out that I can't integrate apparently
no cap i have like 2 friends who took calc bc last year taking the exam w me LOL
emailed to college board
time to fail the calc test
and then at the end some complete nonsense
idk i think its for the alphabet or something
I forgot the intermittent value theorem but I googled it lol
ap tests were limited to an hour this year
sooooo jealous
i forgot what the euler’s method table looked like
i think i might have said MVT tho?
One of my friends couldn’t submit any question
rip
rip
all of the sites that google recommends for math questions
damn
oh well tho
i messed up the last part of the first question and i realized it a minute after turning it in
I don't think mine was labeled
oh i didn't know how to do that one
i realized that after i turned it in
ugh
since it was a semi circle from 0 to 8
for 2 weeks
my teacher is SUPER serious abt 5's
ppl that don't get 5's he doesn't talk to anymore
BRUH I AM NOT EMOTIONALLY STABLE AFTER THAT CALC EXAM LMFAO
i thought i could do math, turns out i cannot
the juniors were here trying their asses off, while us seniors were cheating our asses off
i mean they cant cheat
they gotta self study
Imagine all of us turning up to case with 5s on our exams not actually knowing what the fuck is going on in any of our classes
But I also have completely forgotten how to do calculus in the last year so I guess it’s not too bad
Which isn’t too bad
@beckck you should have gotten an email from the fin aid office
Rip cal state colleges online
i’ve taken java and data structures and next semester i’m taking logic and discrete math
Ok cuz I need to decide if I want to try to skip it w college credit
But like the stuff u talked about earlier we didn’t learn
Did you take math 121? Or did you skip it?
Does anyone know if you need to take the math diagnostic test to skip math 120
I think if you score above a certain point on the SAT/ACT, you don’t have to take it??
i didnt have to take it
here’s how to test out of calc 1 if u dont wanna take it at case
im just taking a calc 1 class w my local community college lmao
The thing is idk if I wanna test out of 121 but I definitely don’t wanna take 120
121 seems like poopy
Do I even remember how to math??
I feel like I would fail the test, get put in 120, then realize that I already knew how to do it all and I just forgot
I was helping my little cousin with her math and I had to sweat mentally doing 53/2
Yoo who wants to do a late night vc
I guess not 😔
I can’t talk or I’ll wake my family up :/
I had a massive thesis tho 😦 4 body paragraphs
4th grade me had a head bigger than his body
howdy how do u sleep without ur bones going everywhere
This guy on an electric scooter rang my doorbell looking for work
All these people come from the city and ask for work. Very sad
Idk. I don’t answer the door
why would you go to people's doors to work? like what are they going to do?
IDK???
It’s just annoying tbh but also sad
Like I don’t really mind the disruption but very weird
I thought it was happening all over at first but I searched and realized it’s not
It is nice tho and I am saying I shouldn’t take it for granted
worm in car
I’m studying right now and brain hurty 😭
i took 1 exam
i slept through ap lit exam today
It was monday
Ok I have to go study otherwise it won’t happen 😭
Aw shit here we go again
Is that what it feels like
couldnt be me
I don’t think I’ve ever had black liquor ice tbh
If we can’t get into juniper
but the room u are looking for could already be gone
so if you dont act fast, u'll get a room u might not want
So there’s a chance u don’t get a juniper one in those 12?
I’m honestly kinda worried we won’t get into juniper
and there are 3 (maybe four if cutter? idk)
getting a corner room or a single is closer to 5% i think, but still greater than 1%
Damn
Still juniper tho
yeee i miss my room
Damn imagine that
Couldn’t be case
Oh
I’m nervous already
dont be nervous it’s all gonna be fineee
And how do you know that the room is already taken?
if u dont get the room u want, sneak into someone elses
I will kill whoever takes my room
My roommate wants the pool table
I wanted cutter
So we just went w Taft
i dont fully understand cutter
but now they dont want it
why case doesnt have basic climate control is beyond me
probably the dorms are all so old there isnt enough wall space for it
i cant find a floor plan or anything of cutter
Cuz it isn’t there’s anymore
And case hasn’t put anything up
What if case doesn’t exist
What if case is really just a feeder school for osu
Or know what it looks like inside
aand this is why we cant have nice (ac) things
Damn
60 years holy shit
Def more expensive tho
But I will bear through 2 years of sad boi dorming for 2 years of decent rooms
Turn it into a frat house before we leave
i'm gonna be real though
Rip hawken
that was not that bad tbh
I can’t stop shaking
It wasn’t that bad, but there were 2 questions that just threw me off
But I’m just tired
Like, so tired
Oh god I can’t tell you
We probably didn’t get the same version
sorry @lookingforthegoldenlight 🥺
also, in the same way that its not the cold, but the wind, its not the heat but the humitiy
i hate when it’s sticky out
It’s raining really forcefully here on the East side
rain is so soothing
Ohio weather <<<
I like crushing worms after a good rain #ohiotings
Bruh NJ is bipolar as fuck
yeah I think it’s supposed to be severe weather in nj
Ok the rain is so strong, my satellite TV went out 😦
@stuckinohiolads what were the resources you are using for the Calc Exam?
fuck
brain no work
quick maths
Oh ye
I didn’t think abt that
so, hopefully that will work
I don’t know if that has anything identifying me as a senior on it
it doesnt say grade on it anywhere?
there be mice in the kitchen, and trying to hide the food is a pain and 1/2
I do want a donut tho
then i wont add anything
I added it and it was helpful because I never used my meal plan
But if you have other means like credit card or cash then you don’t need it
Omg
Why don’t we have a Julia command?
because i dont have a sticker 😭
i forgot i have my own role
Nope
I saw the email but haven’t done it yet
I’d call the security office? Idk
if they want us numbers, they selling them to 3rd parties
it seems like it monitors texts
and it seems to ping your location to whomever is incharge
wtf, they made fake news broadcasts and used them as "sources" of why their product is no useful and needed
Bye all taking a social media cleanse break so will leave the server
Actually too much work just going to delete discord app

u should have just told mr apple to change his eye emoji
Damn u rite
isn’t the apple company near u
couldn’t be me
I literally haven’t done shit in a year
Damn that’s true
I guess that makes up for all the hours I’ve spent not doing shit
did i just fucking realize
that you dont
U need a medical condition
Literally no college dorm has AC
I mean, i got sleep problems, but wtf
I can’t 🥺 I’m social distancing with my friends
before i was cut off, rudely, is that a heater below the windows?
medical needs
Omg no water stations?
Someone was posting ads so I removed them and told people to stop doing that
It wasn’t much lol
do any of you peeps forsee any of the labs reopening to undergrads in the fall? I was asked to leave as a highschooler b/c of covid, but is the situation diff for ug's?
Nope
I lost 2 lab positions at Cleveland clinic because of Corona. They said no Undergrads and no High Schoolers
Some places have online research but I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work
a bunch of schools in cali have already closed for the fall
uhhh idk man i feel like its too early to tell if youll be able to go in late summer.. that may just be his hopes but idk how confirmed that is
Aw mannnnn
i guess we'll find out
I already got the haircut lmfao
rip
yeah deleting social media does not work
I have yet to cave to tiktok
But I did have to delete Twitter bc I spent like 10 hours a day on it 2 weeks ago
that would be sick
it looks like it might be able to be done using user id's so, its not outside the realm of possobilities
Nah I looked it up but it wasn’t possible
Guess who had to deal with dog shit at 2am
Damn rip
Idk I just be chillin
Shit it’s 5am
rip
and they annoying af
yeah hella annoying
dunno
@addat Yes, they sometimes coat my car and i'm farther from the lakeshore than CWRU
Rip now it's hailing here :/ rip my tomato garden
Damn just ban bugs
damn it wasn't hailing over here on the west side
Why didn’t we think of that before
we should just ban corona wtf
Smh my head
That doesn’t mean they can’t scare us tho
doesn’t mean I can’t be terrified of them
But there's no reason to be terrified! They don't attack unless provoked
You can drive 20 minutes and milk a cow
I don't live in a city
Doesn't mean I don't live in Raleigh
Boom i don't live in a city
Unfortunately, I still do
yeah okay he doesn't live in a city
There are no car dealerships in beachwood?
I've lived here for oh, 18 years
It was my dad's car
hey it's probably safer than a plane
@spacemanboris Beachwood is a crowded place, you must be talking about Bedford (which is near Beachwood). I don't think there has ever been a car dealership in beachwood unless you're talking about the one in Orange Village (which borders Beachwood, but the only dealership is the Tesla/Porsche one)
I used to work at the lego store at Beachwood Place lmao
capital letters bad
Nothing I just wanted to see which one of u would respond
Damn autocorrect
Autocapitalizing names smhcmy head
computer engineering
close enough
idk most games i play are singleplayer though
I need a Neel now
"neel stop kneeling" *looks of confusion*
awww
I couldn't pronounce my name as a kid
Sometimes I still do lmfao
rip
My last name is hard to fuck up
I pronounced it as "Bay-liss" in my head
@spartan010 mine on the other hand....
kindle's racist apparently
oh

Idk if I should
b/c my parents are nearby
No one wants to vc anymore
awww
When’s ur last ap?
Bruh my phone wanted to correct ur name to parma

@jujulb idk, i think we do?
she's always ok when i write in arial tho
Idk if I even remember how to write
Awww 🥺🥺
and my llama is on the computer
I do not wanna hear abt yet another guy missing his gal and riding a tractor
It’s far from Seattle and my parents
Mainly the last reason, I’ve never seen the campus so all of you people convinced me 🥺
I haven't visited the campus
I'm a bit scared abt the whole East Cleveland thing but it'll be ok :3
Or imma be pissed
My dad's been telling me that if we do have campus in the fall that I shouldn't stay out too late off campus or take the public transportation
b/c post-corona ppl are gonna be jobless and poor ppl will be angry
Yea but even if it’s limited I’d still rather be on campus
so since it's a shady area i'm more likely to get stabbed, mugged, or smth
Damn
I'd just rather they don't
I think coronavirus is probably gonna stop that
b/c it's a waste of money
omg yeah if my parents told me that they were gonna do that
But now they aren’t sure
If both our parents don’t feel safe flying
Nah he’s probably working on his laser cutter
smh guys Cleveland isn't that bad
Personally I've heard it's not that bad
Like ppl apparently make it seem like we're bordering Syria or smth
I've literally walked the stretch past uptown into the residential parts (into East Cleveland) and it's not that bad
And I think u can call for a car or something if u don’t feel safe walking
just don’t look people in the eye
There aren't many homeless in the Midtown-Uptown area of cleveland...
oh jeez
holy shit
Someone tried to rob the bank on the ave too
Which is kinda fucking hilarious imo
But who robs banks anymore
Lame o

Haven’t talked in a while what have y’all been up to
UK ITS MY ACC SHOE

Trying to get done with school
I’m applying to a ton of scholarships as well so I don’t have to sell a kidney or sperm donate
Idk I mean I haven’t done it
I just saw an advert for it last years
what else do I not need
Imma sell my brain, I don’t use it anyways
damn I don’t have one of those to sell :/
also the housing app was due on the 13th and I committed on the 2nd so I didn’t give myself much time
I’m not worried, it’s a big school and I can avoid him if I really need to
awww roshan :(((
That’s fair
It’s supposed to be car
But care has car in it
car car car
oh carp

tbh ive just been wasting my life away though
It sucks having to say no :/
I binged last kingdom
my friends and i took a fat got break
we watched never have i ever on netflix
Oh
Oh
I watched never have I ever too
Shit I still haven’t slept
this shit is so hard to binge oml
It’s not a real shounen anime if it doesn’t run for a 100+ episodes
@spartan010 @wuhoo4158 omg never have I ever
and as someone who is of the same exact background as Devi's fam
but the accents were wrong, b/c those were North Indian accents, not South Indian ones
oh gotcha
oh, your brain does have genes
I feel like someone made a gc but idk
If someone wanna make or add me to a gay chat plz do tho
Never
cuz most of it is shite
i'd never be seen by a crowd
i work primarly in the shadows
the only instument i've mastered is the air gutair
@mootdoot i agree, i hate being on stage
I rented a marimba before everything fell and I feel pure happiness beeping and booping
i tried playing quads in marching season
i’m too short 😔
Awww
mad respec for quad players
or any percussion ppl i don’t understand how rhythms
Try playing two separate rhythms on piano, that stuff hurts my brain
I find 4 mallets much harder than opposing rhythms on piano and it’s weird
Technically it’s less to think about bc 10 fingers > 4 mallets but my brain hates it
Idk my English teacher freshman year kinda cemented what those meant. She was like “connotation, think of a con man. He doesn’t mean bad, he has to make a living, but the rest of the world doesn’t see it that way. So connotation is what the word means outside it’s dictionary definition”
I don’t think I’ve ever gone over connotation since middle school
what if someone steals it😭
Left front
they really do
Yea ain’t no pockets in women jeans
i never realized people actually kept their phone in the front pocket
For me it’s keys and other junk in my right front pocket and phone left front
My phone clunked down the stairs
like the worst spot smh
I used to keep it in my back pocket but I often kept forgetting to take it out. when I sat down and sophomore year I sat down and cracked the back camera of my iPhone
i would cry
I was pissed cuz I’m not fat and it was the new iPhone 7 at the time
I will die on this hill
Never used a screen protector
Ok but real talk, did you ever have a sibling smear chap stick all over your phone b/c you pissed her off?
I have accidentally smeared chapstick on my phone but not intentionally
my sister just be telling me my outfit is ugly when she’s mad
My sister n I don’t rlly get upset at each other
I took my sisters chipotle she got for her bf cuz I was hungry
I WAS HUNGRY
But it wasn’t urs??
IT WASNT BUT I HATE HER BF
AND I WAS HUNGRY
Ok if you’re hungry and you just got home from running a lot at practice and you see a bowl of chipotle, lying unarmed in the open, would you not go for it?
my sister would fight me if i ate her food
I wouldn’t out of fear of getting chapstick rubbed on my phone
But I was given previous permission so not chapstick phone
I drank the rest of her Canada Dry and I left before she found out
Man why is my sibling so much worse than yalls
But I hate ginger ale!
I hate soda 😦
I’m 2 years younger but she really doesn’t know how to live on her own
fr tho idk what my life would be like if i didn’t have a sibling
I don’t think I boss my sister around but I’ll just open her fridge b like “ur stupid” and give her some food
yeah I feel like my life would be sad if I wasn’t a twin
literally life would be so much worse
If I leave the dishes in the sink there’s only one culprit smh
Funnily tho me n my sister never really got along until she left for college
Carly and I used to argue all the time when we were younger, but now we’re really close 🥺
My sister doesn’t know best at all @sar.hh
imma miss her when she’s not visiting me at case 😭
Upsetting that I can’t just crash my sisters apartment when I’m like 4 hours away
ik it’s gonna be so sad seeing them less 🥺😭
it’s cool u guys go to the same college tho
Okay who wants another story abt my wicked sister
My brother is in grad school now
My car is a comp sci nerd/genius (depending on your perspective) so she hacked my car and everytime I used to open the door, instead of the Subaru welcoming sound and display, it used to say the tik tok thing, “the horse c*ck...”
I don’t think we even had a prank in mind before it all got shut down
I forgot senior pranks existed
I was talking to my sister n she was talking about them I was like wow yet another experience I lost
I never planned on joining in but when I was a kid I always wanted to fill a school swimming pool with jello
My school can’t come up with good prank ideas so
But these last two years sucked someone filled the stairs with balloons and the other clogged the toilets with tp
My oldest brother’s year, they parked cars on campus (like in the middle of the school buildings there is a field area and that’s here they parked them) and took the wheels off their principal’s car
Took the wheels off the car??? That’s wild
And they also all started their car alarms at the same time
I know lol my brother was apart of it but didn’t get in trouble. The janitor got fired tho for helping
Our school made the bargain of cancelled all exams in exchange for no senior pranks
the poor janitor 🥺🥺
Lmao seniors don’t have exams at my school 😎
Idek if we’re having exams this year
My all elective schedule requires no exams to begin with but rip to my peers
My last day was the 11th
I still have APs
I pretend I didn’t do my ib test for my health
I don’t remember why we were criticizing him though
I’ve only had Carl’s on road trips so I don’t remember the taste
I don’t eat burgers enough to rank chains
Damn not even here and I still get roasted 😔
If a burger isn’t drenched in sauce and lettuce to drown out the taste of the meat I don’t want it
Hard to mess up chicken tenders
That’s why I don’t like in n out
You can almost never go wrong chicknugs
Oh well I never ate that much red meat to begin with then
Never had pork before
you haven’t??
Nope
i’ve never had fish before
I used to eat fish but now if it isn’t crustaceans I don’t vibe
why can’t they just walk like damn
Yea they can’t even speak
Except whales
dolphins are pretty sick
they go eeee eeee tho
Whales are chill except the ones that prey on seals 🥺
Rip to polar bears
that’s so sad we love polar bears
My homies hate polar bears
but they can kill
boo humans
They’re killing machines
They look cuter farther away
u caught him at a bad angle
mmm so i'm mad at my art teacher
b/c she literally just accused me of trying to copy off of other people's work
bc someone has probably done it or thunk it
but that's not plagiarizing work......
there's nothing wrong with that
I didn't use a human model b/c my style isn't realistic
I can't draw
tho the general style for it is  cartoony
wtf dyno >:c
whenever u type car the lil car emote will come up
car
car
Car toon
Keep calm and car ry on
and it's absolutely terrible in terms of quality
@sar.hh @jujulb this be you guys tho
I just used snipping tool cuz I couldn’t find out how to save images lmfao
dyno doesnt seem to like when its not by itself it seems
Damn
I think the best thing that has happened to this server is albert having dyno auto-add stickers
@spartan010 can the :face: sticker also be added whenever someone says “🧿”
It’s the evil eye
oh
can someone pin that please?
And then Sarah did the cursed face and I was like what’d wrong with a blue ball
idk what the worm is but if you’re up playing with it, please go to bed
Did I do something wrong? 🥺
idk what the worm is I got it from an Instagram meme😭😭😭
“idk what the worm is but if you’re up playing with it, please go to bed”
Is the worm supposed to
Albert idk what the worm is 😭😭😭 I’m just repeating the meme
Is the worm supposed to represent
....oh
no, u are fucked in the head
Fair ig
*im still not convinced these purity things y'all are talking about arent about eugenics*
what happened?
u can't see that tho
so it never happened
WTF
*its a hard knock life for*
i tried nazar_amulet but it doesnt work
WTF
it doesnt likfe the underscore me thinks
it doesnt like it when its in rich text
bruh idk if there's a fix for this
without me actually trying and i dont have time for that
but what julia wanted was for it to react to the emoji
you don’t need to do that, it’s obviously being difficult
discord machine broke
and why do custom emotes work but standard ones dont
it's proably cuz the default emojis are changed so they no longer are in that :name: format
whereas custom emojis are still in that format so when dyno checks the text it still registers
i wonder, i think its cuz the emotes are probably unicode
nope
rip
HAHAH FUCK YOU DYNO
SUCK MY DICK AND BALLS
OMG
fair enough
except when its not
the cleveland subreddit needs to be stopped
I mean a mini version but still
but if you want to go more than 20min out
Oh
this aint new york m8
Idk
Expensive tho
i still have a stack of rta passes from my job, so im set
Hmm that’s not bad
Oh fck
and where the servivce starts and ends has to do with racism back in the day, so it might be hard to get to some of the more boujee places as they are off system
Are buses generally on time and shit
and if you want to go chill with the methheads
the redline runs through downtown, into lakewood and westpark, adn then to the airport
mostly good, can run late if traffic or the bus hits a kid
there aren't that many trains though
and to drive across town it would take 20 minutes
essentially, you can get to urban areas, the airport and some areas around case through public transport
the 45min commute to work took me near 3h by bus and rail
I’m a broke college student I can’t afford shit tbh
how far dollars go and all that
Find someone who wears Canada goose
i got a 69% match on college roomie
Shouldn’t be hard
i didnt realize how much those things cost
they used to be a good brand apparently
i'm out here with no coat (cuz it aint that cold) and these people killing gooses
cold is just an illusion
I do need to buy a coat tho
Parka or some shit
Isn’t it fucking windy
yeah i mean nothing stops it from rolling off the lake
and u will be inside building
Hour and a half via bus
ye, so rideshare or find a cleveland native who got a car
i lack a car
But do u got a license tho
I don’t even have a license 😭
you dont need any classes or anything
Damn
when i took the test, i googled where they did it--like the streets
took the test
the worst they can do m8 is say no license for u
I hate my brain 😡
worst thing you can do tho is get a multi kill from pedestrians
dunno, eat it
all the calories you will need till u die
Can you rent a car at case?
so, if you live in the usa, you dont need a ohio state id, ur state one will do fine
I don’t even have a Washington id lol
hefty, you could lease a car, but if you dont have credit could be hard
i reccomend trying to get a lisense over the summer
Fair
I can’t get a license before I turn 18
big rip
it takes much longer to go anywhere with it
vs a car
Actually idk if public transit is even a good idea considering corona
(and we dont know if they will even open campus yet)
I’m crossing my fingers so hard
I mean paying regular tuition for online school is just stupid
can't work
can't go anywhere
It just feels like college is supposed to be amazing
can't really volunteer anywhere other than a hospital
And the first year would be wasted idk
That’s fair ig
Idk
as i guy i know says, only the military ever checked if he even went to highschool
I’m also just worried about making friends and shit, like it’s not the same if you don’t meet ppl in person
every other place he went didnt care
i just got my car broken into and now i cant sleep
Oof man I’m sorry
and I woke up and make noise so they ran away
Damn you alright?
And your car got broken into
You ok tho?
i got 4 hours of sleep and I want to punch a wall this shit sucks
Who decided I should wake up this damn early
fuck my cicada rhythm
Poor caterpillar
See now I slept, 10 fucking hours
And I feel Horrible
I fell asleep around 3:30am, woke up at 11:30am, and i feel half asleep
Guess who was interrupted midway through their sleep by their parents yelling at each other at the top of their lungs 🙂
aw albert 🥺🥺 im sorry 🥺
i’m sorry albert 🥺🥺
@spartan010 ugh i getchu - my parents argue loudly in the morning and that’d be what i’d wake up to
omg
I hit them wiith some salt before they went into the oven
Honestly ik a lot of people who don’t use their navigator
Once you get a major advisor you don’t really need one imo
So they’re really just for the interim?
idk that imma try to minmax my navigator though
rip
do you mean Aidan, cause i'm Aidan
forgot her name but my friends navigator gave her an attitude for rescheduling meetings
How can I be on the council yet not granted the rank of mod
rip albert
FML I downloaded the free GTA V and I realized I can’t play on a Mac
Fuck
I’m currently near the eye of the cyclone so it’s not that bad rn
But some time back it was realllyyyy bad
I’m trying to
The cyclone has gone ig
o shit
A lot of their “required” things aren’t required
my school is still trying to have a prom in the summer, ffs
my school is too
i guess
nothing is particularly clear, but they don't want to just lose the deposit on the botanical gardens, so it's still "on"
the rich families where like " Its a sacred right of passage, you just don't cancel it for poor timmy over here"
I never went to prom b/c I had pneumonia then ap tests the day after the next year
Coronavirus: the ultimate "leave room for jesus" prom chaperone
ikr, they wanted 100 for mine
damn lol did u drug her
but look tho
Scary
>still charges to print
Does anyone know what category we’re supposed to schedule our meetings under??
I couldn’t tell you because I haven’t checked my mail in way too long😭
Oop I haven’t gotten anything
Mine is still in the us.
Holy fuck
I think I’m dead
well, i guess you dont have to pay taxes then, congratz
Damn did we just find a loophole
In case anyone was wondering classes will be mostly online even if we are on campus because for example weatherhead is only allowing 12 ppl in a class in the biggest lecture hall
do you know how that'd work with labs
Exams online
well idk about freshman dorms
@addat Now you know my pain
If you want, you can pick up some #deleted-channel and write an #introductions👋
no idk
in the fyi, it says they recommend PC over Macs. to any current students, does it really matter, i personally like macs better but if everything is geared towards windows then i’ll get a windows
aint gonna buy a new computer for that lol
i was gonna get a new computer either way
all my math classes were paper only
partly because typing with math symbols can be difficult especially for those who don't know how to use them in those applications which support them
do u need to be able to run windows
still deciding
prolly math or cs
The requirements for mech. Engineering are truly insane, they want you to have a i9 processor
margaux is math and cs and has a mac
if you have a mac, use it, but i wouldt go out of my way to buy one unless you have some serious cash to burn
bootcamp = solves all problems
how does pre dentistry work
so well-spoken, couldn’t have said it better myself
seriously tho i don’t think case has a pre dentistry track like there is for med school i think they just have the PPSP program thing
FUCK
it really is
that sucks
omg that does suck
quick math
what math profs dont want you to know
we need to go back to the time where they gave you hard drugs to knock u out
if u don’t have teeth you’ll never have a cavity
*tooth gone*
flossing sucks
what happened?
i no have wavy teeth anymore
bruh sarah the top too? that must be annoying
but i suck at puting them in
Don’t flex on us plebs like that Ben
I don’t, I’m lying.
I was at the dentists today to get fillings cuz my teeth r ass
Means I get cavities really easily.
My dentist says every week I havent put them on in months
My parents are in their 40s and have never had theirs out.
idk if i have any
That's some big brain shit
i just be terrified whenever i go to the dentist so i never listen
I got a really bad gag reflex so every time I go to the dentist and they give me fluoride I choke
I know someone with 6 wisdom teeth
the government keeps the wisdom teet
I’ve said too much already
During his gap year, Albert through months of meditation achieved peak comedy.
Everyone will hate themselves by the end of it
what if we all went to med school together
but for med school

I don’t have any questions
Has anyone done their SAGES diagnostic? Why is it 60-90 mins im crying
I don’t think it’s long that’s just all the time they’re giving us to do it
Still dont know how they can social distance us in the dorms
lord knows they’ll find a way if it keeps them from losing money
bro im sad i dont get to take the math diagnostic

^ true math major
I’d rather take a math diagnostic than this shitty essay we gotta do
i dont even have to take the math diagnostic

ive only tried vodka and a few other things @beth9746
LOL WORD it smells so fucking bad
russian vodka puts america to shame
cant even compare
bye albert
it tasted so so so bad too
This is why you need a college education
but beer tastes bad too
Doesnt make you not drunk
I am just at my crackhead hours
My face is not red anymore
kosher tho?
Like can someone explain
Idk
i guess i'm truly a fungi
You realize how sad that is
Don't judge beth
But then I realized it is quarantine so actually not as sad
i'm a sad little simp
sorry adams
If I see another bond movie I will honestly cry. I have seen 16 in the past 2 weeks
never say never
I am no longer Albert
Well too bad
I’m still Adam @addat
And I'm Beth's annoying little brother
Damn ikr
did i miss out
What the hell happened last night
Also wait lemme make something clear: a simp is someone who actively tries to get himself noticed by a girl in ridiculous manners, such as money or extreme acts of selflessness. I’m not a simp, sorry Albert
But I do respect women, but that doesn’t make me a $imp
damn
DWA seems more official
worms are inside the brains of FBI agents
rip
you dont notice it, but all of a sudden they be long from like nothing
idk i think there's something
metal nails dont grow
rip birds
and its supposed to be 80s when the sun gets up, why must the earth warm
they want u to schedule a meeting with an advisor right
o yea sorry
When I log into journey.case.edu I am presented with a calendar. Oh scroll through the months
That’s what happened to me, there’s something wrong with the system
the system is borked it seems
Is anyone else other than me going to register for the math placement in August?
And if it’s not in your portal then you don’t have to take it
@stuckinohiolads  is it not due the 29th for you?
Oh...? That’s news to me. Is that in our portal?
When 50% of my words don’t really have to be my own that’s where I thrive
Oh moood
I swear I already sent out declines n shit but I’m still getting emails
Oh
Oh we split
guys please go to #deleted-channel if u havent done so
I never went to nationals
damn\
Oh no
I did OI for 3 comps and I wanted to quit
I never understood how congress worked
So I never tried it
Its so fucking confusing
I heard "Motion to open the floor for docket nomination" and I got to scared
I don’t even know what that phrase means
I miss extemp so much
I miss that level of anxiety LOL
I miss sitting in the prep room fooling around with the boys
I feel like I stopped caring enough to be nervous
But I still feel it a little
I may want to do something more like LD
I want to research, potentially start a FIRST alumni association, shadow/volunteer at hospitals; do fencing, band, and USG (or maybe some type of congressional debate); and I know I'm only going to be able to do like three or four of those max
^I’m really worried I’m gonna have to drop half of my EC’s in college
Yeah one of my friends from Cat Attack couldn't even join OSU's FIRST alumni association (which was even started by a Cat Attack alum) and he's an electrical engineering major
@mootdoot I don't have the math placement but i rlly want to test out of multivariate
And i was on the math dept website and they had placement test scheduling
@stuckinohiolads you dont have this ?
and im not even in it
howdy some ppl don’t have it in their portal
If you score higher than like 700 on the math for the SAT and 30 or above for act then you don’t need to take it
Idk if the 700 is right but it’s def a 30 for act
So for us who don’t have to take the diagnostic how are we placed into math classes? AP/IB/Dual credits?
Howdy I don’t have it
i have not taken an ap test for calc
but im exempt from the math diagnostic
AP Calc is not that hard
probs minimum act/sat score for math too to get exempt
u can do the maths
Also if you have to take the exam do not feel bad
Lots of CWRU students do and lots are bad at math
dude i geek out at math
but legit this morning i was questioning what if i literally hate math in a year LOL
yeah, i just dont wanna have to redo gen ed stuff
You don’t
bc im between data sci cs and math
Still graduate on time or early
i like math
Like so many people don’t even know their major
u could always do like a math minor if u decide to switch right
yeah the plan is math major and cs and data sci double minor
and if i dread math ill switch to stats
Econ isn’t business
Also economics isn’t finance and does not always involve investing.
It would be more work
college is scary man
Lol my short film is about how college is scary
on another i feel like im such a hot mess rn and ima die LOL
@howdy_. sorry i went to eat
Oh man this is so sad I got a 29 on the act 😭😭😭
It’s only your math sub score
Yea I got a 29 on math
Math is always my lowest even tho it’s my fav subject
SARAH OMG
did u take july last year too LMFAOOO
In college no one gives a shit about your standardized test score
Ugh but that one more point and I didn’t have to do placement
yeah i’m sure the placement thing isn’t even that bad
ik asked but i forgot
can we hop in call during that time i think i need mad help
once someone requests u it says “jane doe has put in a rooming request for u do u accept or decline”
mine looks like that
I can’t wait to b disappointed
i just cancelled the request and accepted hers and it still says the same thing
WTF ITS MIDNIGHT 12
couldnt be me
yea cant be u
idk why it did that twice lmao
It’s not too hard to get a single
yea i feel like it wouldnt be
Oh Noice
everyone wants a roomie
how did that happen
Right I was gna say considering this gc alone I don’t see anyone wanting a single outside of me
Oh littttt
rip
I miss smith 100 rip
i wanted a single for a while
but then i realized i dont wanna be alone when im in my feels LOL
Hey btw for you guys talking about calc, I don't know if they modified the requirements for this year (they haven't been modified on the website anyway), but you need a 5 on the Calc AB exam or the AB subscore of the BC exam to get out of math 121 (which I think is Calc I). You need a 5 on BC to get out of math 121 and 122 (which I believe are calc 1 and 2). 

There was no AB subscore on the BC exam this year so I'm not sure how they'll deal with that
I’ll take a single bath if there’s a small dip in quality I don’t mind
But my need to be alone trumps sad boi hours
Idk I didn’t really go in her bathroom
Idk
that seems like alot of water
I feel like that’s so much work
if u imagined clean and neat dorms
i feel like practically all freshman dorms are trash in any college
cause we freshman
lmao im deadass moving off campus n shit as soon as i can
Although probs getting no sleep
rip
I can give anyone a room tour if they want
mtv has so much old programming that they really dont show
Idk
Doesn’t really matter. Just happy to be able to live there
If I do apartment w someone we have to b Close
i dont see juniper
How close is Juniper to University Hospitals or Cleveland Clinic?
no air conditionaing?
its a big rip
which one should i live in if i wanna work with a dentist
Apparently Juniper
everything you need to know about dorms is in there
Weather update: it’s hit 80
supposed to be 114 here tomorrow
weather update: TOO HOT
You’re not wrong
Suck it @beth9746
Dewine sucks
also just bc 'quarantine' is over doesnt mean social distancing is
political conversations never end well 😭😭
No politics for me but he's doing an okay job with corona. I think he went overboard at points but oh well
Corona is serious Neelson
Corona is serious
He has asthma tho
roman having an asthma attack bc hes laughing too hard
how did the ohio gov go overboard tho
bad bugs
Bugs need to be squashed
wtf

cockroaches can go die
I hate those beetles
Volkswagen ones suck
Nope
also fuck stinkbugs
all my homies hate stinkbugs
FUck cicadas
they make that noise tho don’t they
i rememver when i was in australia i was just vibing and then i looked at the ceiling and realized that there were hundreds of daddy long legs on the ceiling literally everywhere
Don’t study abroad
Well we cannot study abroad now
Stuck in cle
Big rip
dont hate on cle
I can hate on cleveland allll day
I can hate on Wayne
I can hate on New York
fuck outta my state
meg I’m New York’s stupid younger cousin 🙈🙈🙈
upstate ny doesnt count as ny
but I don’t hate on it all the time
Meg I never understand that
It’s stupid
I miss your candy wreath
ur not living on south side so u cant get any next yr
rip
u didnt.
1. Our mayor's hair caught on fire. 2. Our major river caught on fire b/c of extreme pollution. 3. One CLE mayor mooned a reporter. 4. One mayor's wife didn't realize the Nixon was even a president and made a mockery of herself. 5. Some idiot dropped a car from the tallest building at the time (Terminal Tower) and injured 2 ppl (they were trying to catch it). 6. CLE is the first major city to go bankrupt. 7. CWRU refused funding from John D Rockefeller and so he took his money and founded UChicago. 8. BALOONFEST (look it up)
what does case refusing funding from someone have to do w the govt tho lmao
If you hate cleveland that much
Cleveland isn't that bad
Bc my parents pay for my college and i gotta do what they say sadly
I lived there for the first 4 years of my life, it wasn't a terrible place to grow up.
Uchicago is where “fun goes to die” according to what I read on Reddit
ppl in cle hate on cle as a joke bc its funny
I’ve never been to one
I got lost in the suburbs so rip
I’ve never been to an OSU party
I don’t know
Is East cle nice or bad?
BAD
bad
Bad
Bad
My friends are crazy tho
East cleveland is the worst part of cleveland
All y’all went BaD
They got a death wish
I feel like Euclid can be as bad as East cle
harlem is a LOT better than it used to be tho
S. Euclid is about as bad as East cle imo
we went to east cle when we took the rta to target
all my friends were being stupid so it was kinda wack lol
Isn’t target the other way
Idk my friend had a car so we all used that
I went there once at 10 pm and this guy yelled at his gf you stupid cunt I will beat you
John carroll is near where I used to live
It was really sad
It's sad but there is WAY more police presence
Then I guess they're synonyms!
I didn't circle it lmao
people make music for hours on end without being able to show anyone and piano enthusiasts spend 60+ hours mastering a piece while never encountering a dinner party to show off
what happened
Ok as someone whose third home is basically Cleveland and University Circle I will tell you I haven't personally had much of an issue but my sister was followed by some dude at a SciOly tournament held at Case
jk i have been in nyc i hate it
I got in the car and cried because I was so disgusted
well some of us just can’t do that sorry
So I went to his car and I was like did your mother ever teach you manners buddy
But then I forgot I was in TX
weather update: Still TOO HOT
i was at harlem 125 and i was w a group of girls and this guy was like yEaAaa get me some of that WHITE ASS and honestly we were all just laughing it off bc idk it wasnt that bad? im sorry that u went thru that julia tho it sucks and its gross
so I spent most of today powerwashing this families deck
like when the dirt comes off in clean lines
They hurt
i dont know if it is ohio
lol, its Michigan apparently
*oh, i didnt know those mansions had beaches*
*they aren't mansions actually*
*my bad*
*oh rip*
*the most silent class yet*
sorry what? i cant hear you. can you speak up
*you need those fast nimble fingers*
I TURNED THEM BACK ON
I don’t hear anything Meg
I don’t live in that Lakewood though, I live south of the tracks
closer that most of us i guess
Location is important near water
Top 5,000 nationally ain’t bad
so the more money in, the higher the budget that can be used
damn, that is looking more like a college campus
damn, this is how my local school looks
oh, so the usual
we really need to stop forcing kids to beat china
near mlk boulevard, looks like this
aparently, they had about 29 school days canceled due to gun threats a year or two ago
We never had a credible threat
Freshmen year there was a guy who wrote something about making columbine look like a joke in the bathroom, so like half the school didn’t show up
Is, he’s not dead
So Anthony posted on his Snapchat story that he wanted to blow up the school, and then the fbi arrested him, and then 2 days later some rando pulled up to the school, yelled something about bombing the school, and then took off down Franklin at like 60
oh i c
Yeah I mean it was just a stupid threat, but this kid regularly makes racist remarks in class, and yells slurs at minorities
Any1 wanna hop in vc and work on the road map?
😭 I guess not
people are bad at listen
Like 2 weeks ago
Okay but seriously, even if WE get covid, we aren't going to die
It's moreover like the flu for us
tis not like the flu
shit ok dont kill me
I'm really sorry neel,
Yesterday I called you a fungus
while apparently it is much more painful and a much worse experience than the average flu, a lot of kids are also dying from it
well ok we arent AS likely to kick the bucket as older people, but its still a nasty-ass disease
like how kids dont get the lung issues that adults get from it, adults dont get the inflammatory problems that kids AND younger adults get
so while im not super worried, i def dont want it
Okay but we're not kids...? right am i missing something
Idk I looked at stats for ohio at least and the lowest death rate for covid is the 21-30 group
still deaths thou
u maek my pp sad
we definitely dont die as much as older people with pre existing conditions, but we arent immune to dying from this virus lol
I mean we aren't immune. But using marginal analysis it maximizes my happiness by going to the beach and take the risk of getting covid rather than sitting cooped up all day
and if you have it without knowing?
neel you are so smart don't listen to doctors and scientists who clearly don't know what they're talking about
By that logic the whole f*cking world is a carrier and we don't know it until we test them
this some shrodinger shit
Actually marginal analysis is a marginal way at looking at problems and socially optimal when MB=MC
and thats why we need to social distance
except you
neel, u need edumacation
our president told ppl to inject disinfectant into their veins.  u rly want to listen to him?????
bad idea
no politics but death to slave owners
Okay so when does quarrantine end? In january when there's a vaccine?
JOHN BROWN DID NOTHING WRONG
quarantine will probably end soon (if that). social distancing, however, will not
be realistic people don’t wanna fking die
i am though
It will end like in August but even if we have school we are wearing masks
sorry this worldwide pandemic is inconvenient for you @Fungi
oh nooo
dont spank meeee
:XMARK6: **shlyf**, you can't use that
:XMARK6: **christian**, you can't use that
now u can all go outside

“Yet”
That's not how this is supposed to work
Ben want to be in my sorority

while i still have like a month of school left 😭😭
When did your school start why it ending so late
starts early sep
Lmao do they still hand u ur diploma and shit
Where did u end up committing
didn't i tell u this
oh
Idk
Idk if I can take living w my parents for another year
Yea idk it’s not rly ideal
I don’t want to say I’ll take my chances but..
oh why'd you ping me earlier then
@bhrisbopher almost four years, still haven’t unboxed
omg anybody in pre med, the animal farm underneath the med school is adorable
Yea I didn’t add any extra
yes? Idk
can someone change my role? im tired of being the lonely neon green
I can offer acceptance into @Souper Cewl Dood  if you want
I need code help can someone provide tech support
how would I go abt making it so the code doesn't run until a keystroke is recorded
If it is a keystroke then a listener is what you need
I just want a way to manually start it
this is terminology i need to look into
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {} i think is the method you need
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {} and then this method to take the boolean value from the keypressed and do shit with it
uhhh, would I have to put all the code I want to run in the key event thing
in keyevent all you would need is a statement (which u can look up) which takes the keystroke and if ANY KEY is pressed, it sets a boolean value (global value) to to true. in the actionPeformed method, you would need a loop that reads that boolean value and once its true, whatever shit you wanted to happen, put that there
the actionperformed method runs in the background 24/7 and you don't need to explicitly call it
can u believe that i hate comp sci lmao
||I love ur work in race to witch mountain, it was absolutely horrible||
||smh my head||
✨💕🧚you tried your best💕✨🦋 now stop trying💕✨🧚🦋
Fr omg
Any1 do their math placement test?
If case uses your skills in high school-level math to determine whether or not you should take a placement test, I would think it wouldn’t be very bad
ye i know it won’t be bad i just hate tests 😩
Treat it like a homework assignment
I think you need a 25/30 or above to place out pre algebra
also, Ik you're not supposed to use notes or anything. But if there is something YOU KNOW  you know how to do, but literally just need a glimpse at something, I would do it. Not saying I did or you should, you know, as it says not to
Oh then I think you need like an 80%
but idk what Im doing yet entirely, one of the 2
It could be lower tho
Idrk I didn’t take it but I remember ppl in our groupme did
Yeah pre med doesn’t matter
But you should take math 125
121 is harder and is for engineering, math, CS etc
and 121 is hard
is is the hardest class, class 0
Well idk I think it is easy but I tutored someone for it
or class 1
these naming conventions are going to be the death of me
Cause you said you need at least an 80% to test out of pre-alg
I have a question about class registration— I was told to use rate my professor to see what I should sign up for. So how long does class registration last?
It doesn’t
In college you will learn to accept this how things work and stop questioning why
well, here i go to fail the placement test then
I like answers though
But im in the SIS looking at math classes and seats are taken
We register last I guess
So will the math placement test restrict us from choosing a class higher?
And then you can add a class if you want
I heard that we shouldn’t take too many pre reqs in a year?
Otherwise you are legit stuck
I took sages, math 126, thtr 110, and Econ 364
However freshman really shouldn’t take Econ 364
Or if they have ap credit Econ 309 or 307, calc, sages and an arts and science class
But the prof doesn’t like freshman to take it because it’s a harder than other electives
The prof just doesn’t think freshman should take it because the exam averages are 60s or 70s and feels taking other electives prepares you
But no I am actually dumb af... just like work hard ig
Yeah if you have to take it but if you get ap credit it doesn’t
I don’t love you. I only love my bed and my mamma. I am sorry
mine never did so i contacted my navigator and she fixed it for me
But don’t our score reports send until we get our senior year AP scores back?
they should be automatically sent if u put in a school to send them to when u took the exam
but i did that and they still didnt
alright, my fate has been sealed, the math test is complete
maybe, or im already dead
I was gna take the test today but instead I took a 2 hour nap
idk if the shopping cart is open for u guys??
that seems like a huge waste of money if its payment on a per class basis
sorry im a little late
but who takes a math diagnostic and who doesn't
cause i just dont have one
Then you don’t have to take it
oh pog
It depends on your math score on whatever standardized test you took
@beth9746 guess what? today police at edgewater (the beach) stopped people from coming in
do I have to take placement tests if I got 'usable' AP scores in higher level math
If you have the test in your portal I would still take it for the formality
"Housing is closed for the 2020-2021 year"
yeah I know 😔 my friend got really sick the beginning of the first semester
I haven’t written it yet 😳
I feel that
I haven't uploaded my photo yet
I just took what they wanted and sliced it
I forgot I did it
I mean this letter isn’t like the sages essay we can fuck up in the letter
I still need to write mine
they want us to suffer
i mean, i havent read it yet, but this is about to be so boomer, im going to die
we had an article last year that was absolutely terrible. i spent my essay completely destroying the article
its going to be phone bad
I don't even want to look at mine
how bad is it, i'd rather not die from my eyes rolling so far back in my skull it squishes them into pancakes
i laughed at her studying the internet before it was a thing lmaoo
it’s not bad just some facts and study’s are wrong
Even just getting the results from the math placement will destroy me
""Daddy," she said, "stop Googling. I want to talk to you.""
So bad
"A 15-year-old boy told me that someday he wanted to raise a family, not the way his parents are raising him
(with phones out during meals and in the park and during his school sports events) but the
way his parents think they are raising him — with no phones at meals and plentiful family
conversation."
So, is the boy upset that he’s on his phone too much to communicate with his parents??
remember phone bad!
He has to raise himself now bc his parents are googling “69 urban dictionary definition”
I hate it
I hate it so much
I don’t have enough people to text so automatically that’s wrong
for our fucking classes
If anything this reopened my eyes to the fact that I can FaceTime my friends when I don’t see them in person
I was so used to seeing them in and out of school that I didn’t even think abt texting or calling them until now
"Students were not developing friendships the way they used to. At a retreat, the dean described how a seventh grader had tried to exclude a classmate from a school social event. It’s an age-old problem"
One can never fully trust nyt but damn that’s low
Please tel me it’s full of sad parents
“My son hasn’t stopped forniting this article is soooo true”
right underneath of it tho
Like even if you believe it ruined us the substance of the article seems like completely tomfoolery
and out of left field
We would converse but miss rona said f you
I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DO TAXES FUCK OFFFF
oh ffs
Imagine if someone accidentally said turtle
these comments tho
“The teat of a smart phone”
That’s taking away our CoNsTiTuTiOnAl RiGhTs
But what’s so wrong abt a phone in crowded places?? Like jaywalking sorta makes sense bc you might get yeeted but what’s wrong with texting in line
THIS IS SO SAD
Our teachers aren’t allowed to talk politics to us
The youngins dont kno that one
I’ll probably never use poetry ever again so I wish I didn’t kno it tbh
Phone = wiskey TIL
I think op is mad that everytime they pull out a flask they think they have a whiskey addiction
And when they can’t call 911 because they refuse to be a slave??? What then??
dead slave lol
Is that no longer possible??
I guess I understand that the availability of it can force you into using it when “unnecessary” but also, turn off your fucking phone
“I’m bringing out my phone because my friend wants to know if her nudes are good enough to send. It’s terribly important”
"Here, want to verify?"
“I’m bringing out my phone because you are extremely boring. I would not like to leave, as you are paying the bill and I want to buy more food”
George Orwell’s dystopian nightmare is a bad government
This entire comment dive brings up a point, if phone bad, how did they read this article
ye 1984 was about government, corruption, and the complete controll those in power want
I'd like to file that under, that 100% happened
That was on camera, and all the joys that came with the internet seeing it
Phone = Hard drugs You heard it here first
I got mine a few days back
Phone make u lose IQ?!?!?!
I wonder if they considered that they’re lonely due to being old and the only person that talks to them can only complain abt their habits
When I went to camp I hated not having my phone
I remember almost nothing from those moments in my life because I couldn’t take quick pics w my phone lmao
never been
any overnight camp was far too much $$
My phone has made me more talkative as an introvert
the 2nd one has nothing to do with phones
Okay idk if this is an American thing or nah but why is everyone expecting schools to teach everything to their children
Yea I mean America can only be as best as their lowest common denominator and uhmmmm...they don’t even have internet
or what if each person was calling their dying mum or something
the reason we are so desperate to test the hell out kids is cuz https://tenor.com/bkKGc.gif
we clearly want dinner with our phone here
But howdy on the flipside is countries that are considered "highly educated" such as S. Korea, the competition is sooo stressful that kids end up having higher rates of suicide/depression/mental illness
So it's not education we need to fix
Well we do need to fix education, but it needs to b fixed along with literally every other system in this world
america want to be number one, and they are trying to get us under that same stress
Eye contact? Glen Lerner is the lawyer for u!
after the iphone
Gotta hate that teen pregnancy statistic falling
Stupid gen zs, not having kids
teen pregnancy isn't the only thing down, pregnancy in general is down all over the world and we're getting into the problem that not only are populations contracting in size.
and when they shut down, so many people lost their jobs
it’s a shame really
Yea it is a shame
its the way of the world unfortunately
I go to toy stores to buy shit for myself why do I need a kid
Brick and morter retail is dying overall
Well China stopped their one child policy so they’re hoping for a baby boom
*China has this cuz of some 1 child policy and being hell on earth*
which may cause them to end up sorta like Russia geopolitically
I like brick n mortar places which is rlly a shame
They’re mad that people translate?
Rip
neel, if you cant fix it urself, microcenter isnt the place to be xD
“Unfortunately did not get the results I wanted”
*you dont say*
Also who has their volume on except for old people??
nah i have my ringtone on when im in the car
But all the time?? That would be so annoying for me
"i don't care" by FOB
My phone is always on vibrate 😩 ringtones bother me
but i never get called so...
the generic alarm sound is terrible
I changed all my ringtones bc the generic sound sucks
I also don’t get calls
you start to hate it after people have random alarms go off in classes
But if I have to hear a sound everytime someone sends smth in here I’d go insane
ye, no point with a notification or ringtone if you never get texted or called, just leave it on silent and call it a day is what i went with
my alarm noise is the sound of wind, but it gets progressively louder the longer i let it run
That’s horrible
But illuminate is horrible too
they’re all horrible
My mom hates when I don’t pick up the phone bc I’m always on dnd
All basic alarm sounds sucks
you should be able to set it so each contact has a differnt tone if any
There is no worse sound then the iphone default alarm sound.
I just tried to think it and my mind blanked
*hears car noises and beeps*
Why would I listen to wind sounds when My sick walking playlist is right there
Also who listens to wind sounds on their phone when they’re outside
He just boots that shit up in his car and jams out
Why is everyone saying dystopianscifi when all dystopian sci-fi’s are abt how a horrible power uses tech to control masses and not abt the existence of tech on its own
but they arent true
they clearly need more "face to face conversation"
The point of 1984 was to show the dangers of power hungry leaders.
Wasn’t it written during that time or am I trippy
That doesn't exist
Idk sometimes I think and I see an ad abt what I was thinking how spooookyyyy
who doesn’t wanna go to the gulag?
the year the prc took over mainland china
According to someone I’ve spoken to, normal is relative

oh
what ever happened to him
I still have those vhs tapes of the clown n crew
Sad that they got rid of them in the 2010s
sent from my iphone1
and this is why we hate users in it
@stuckinohiolads it doesn't
all that I needed was a way to manually progress the code, like turns in a card game or something
oh my bad, i didn't know thats what u wanted
i used the keylistener for my game for CSA (it's an asteroids knock off) and yeah scanner didn't work for me
I do blame parents for their inability to raise their children without tech
Wtf
I didn't get my first computer or phone until freshman year of hs, so i meannn
I had a DSi in elementary school
An iPod touch for part of 5th grade and middle school
I still have my ds
I wish I got  a ds
I need to get an SD card
Parents never let me get one
My teachers aren’t teaching anything worthy of taking notes
And my teacher told me to end it
and working
rip
Except for my AP classes
Those damn comics
Masks don’t work
WTF
I only have like 10 internet friends
So they’re wrong
I have internet friends
I wanna upload shit
does anyone else feel like a smuggler when they get paid in bound 20s?
Idk my Minecraft village has plenty of crime
my dad thinks my phone will get me corona
It’s because of that damn phone!
Your phone does carry a lot of germs
Omg I’m in the hall of fame
I saw someone do a really bad pun with Karl von Habsburg-Lothringen
Regardless I’m staring at something like a zombie computer or no
well shit
cuz i opened it and i've been complaining about it
A terrible horrible example
And you completely missed me because I was 100% just thinking about lesbians
Oh no
Can’t fuck a phone yet so I’ll always be looking for at least one person to connect with
when the Butlerian Jihad begins, don't expect me to save you from the thinking machines, we only have so much melange
Don’t want my own biological ones tho
sorry ron 🙈
with how poorly roads are marked half the time you need gps
Waze do be detecting cops though 🙈
So i stopped using it
cops can suck it
also i drive slow anyways so it wasn't a big issue for me
I drive the speed limit, but my dad does not, so he needs waze 🙈
Waze is the shit
Oh
I’m sorry about that 🥺
That really sucks
Ah fuck drunk drivers
oh i was in a T bone crash
Scary shit honestly
Ohio police SUCK
It’s hella annoying
My dad hates driving thru Ohio
Ohio police don’t fw the speed
Ohio sucks for driving for that reason
near the citiy
and they want to fill their quotas
don't drink and drive
This was my car
Don’t fw snow
rip
I’ve slid on snow so much don’t ever fw snow
Pretend I didn’t say that
Yeah since my subaru had some 4wd shit it tried to get grip on the snow which caused the car to like slide even more and i spun around and smashed into a tree
his car had a SCRATCH
I mean i wasn't okay after it
I had 5 broken ribs and a broken shoulderblade and a bruised kidney 😦
all my ribs were broken on one side too so it was extra bad
I’m so sorry that happened
That really sucks
They didn't, my kidney was bruised and was bleeding a lil but they said i would be fine
So yes PSA Cleveland roads suck and drivers suck here
I hate quarantine drivers
richmond rd had a 1ft drop that wasnt fixed for like 6months
Can’t commute from where i live 🤪🤪
It’s like all the bad drivers are taking their opportunity to get out now
"there is no one on the road, i dont have to be careful"
-quarentine drivers
Me except I was such a clown the other day
They’re either extremely slow or terribly reckless
Uh oh
Because I didn’t have one to begin with
lmk if you find one
i've been without
its helpful given that there is really only 1 highway nearby
I only either stay in my suburb or go downtown
Once I’m out the city tho I’ll just Perish ig
but the traffic
Chicago traffic is ass
ur light traffic is our heavy
Someone should make a tiktok about that. What you can do while in Chicago traffic
I wish I took a video
Still won’t cave to tiktok
They won’t get me
If I was in Chicago traffic
like made them while in chicago traffic
It never felt that bad to me
I’ve started to just do that in heavy traffic like why waste the energy of staying on the break for 10 minutes
I don’t know why but driving makes me sleepy
Like after I get out of my car
I feel soooo sleepy
The first 5 minutes of driving makes me super sleepy
idk i play rock music in my car so im no way close to feeling sleepy
some people say they could never sleep in a car
I play music too but still I’m sleepy
I don’t know why
and my car has the stop start feature so everytime i stop it literally jerks me awake
Oh man my parents go to thing for when I was little and never slept was putting me in a car
"dont drive like my brother"
well, that was one of the famous lines from car talk, and i used to listen to them alot when they were on air
(and partly cuz dr kazdan said he would be down with testing me)
When I got behind the wheel I just did what he did
I think my mom is decent but I don’t wanna drive like her
okay besides my car accident, im an amazing car driver, after all, how many teen drivers do you know how to powerslide by turning traction control off and using the handbrake?
My in car teachers praised my driving not to flex
oh noes
I only know how to start, stop, slow down, and accelerate
so rip
i picked up some shit
My dad likes to pretend he’s a race car driver
Learn car fixing stuff from my dad
I learned abt a resistor yesterday and how when it’s broken the ac Will Not work
rip
bigger rip
He didn’t give a shit
Except
I don’t know if cbus has any
of dont speed down 90
when near downtown
Oh you guys don't even KNOW LA traffic
I don’t remember LA traffic
Last time I was in Cali was 2011
LA traffic near the stadium is much worse than chicago traffic could ever be
However I love the scary sanfran roads
never been, too far away
too scary
tho if there is that much traffic
Oh man I did a road trip to cali one year
Never again
We did a roadtrip from San Diego up to San Fran and that shit scared me
i always wanted to drive down route 66, but its closed now qq
but soo scary
I want another popsicle
I remember we were driving down from Flagstaff to Tuscon (idk how to spell it) and we drove through a desert thunderstorm... my best pics i've ever taken on my nikon were during that
But I feel like my mom would judge me
idk
i hate simps
im from cbus so that's always the worst part of the trip for me
Oh
no u r tho
What Dublin school?
I would ask which school in lewis center but i sadly don't know them haha
Wow someone should simp me then but only thru cashapp
Howdy the link doesn't work
i tried going to it
He wanted to throw some cash
You missed ur chance
they must have realized im not a big tiddy goth gf and deleted the account rip
shame 😦
Can’t have fake big tiddy goth gfs
Nope I’m the only one @beckck how about you?
I don’t know anyone else in my district though
i feel like I've had that conversation like 50 times
OSU is horrible nooooo
NO FUCK
you didnt specify
Thing is half my class is going there
And I wanted to leave
RIP
Even then you don't see them bc it's so big, but like I also wanted to leave so i did the same thing haha
Is osu a state school
OH
Seriously???
Y’all suck
i almost went to michigan rip
I didn’t wanna go there
Didn’t apply tho
I didn’t wanna apply lol
Boo sports
I need answers
neel, simping wont get u another extracirrciula on ur app
Only a few hours a day
Idk im not a math major
You can’t win this one
ron never accused u
i need the quote channel
that quality suck
what happened there
It shouldn’t b a crime
i wanted to fly a drone over it, but for some reason thats illegal
I mean I guess bc of all the ppl
honestly, people suck
just the worst
really is
A shame they still exist
there were a few who tried standing up against their existance
but aparently the asteroid came too early
tho i hear they are tring something called corona
Never tried it
Sure it’s delightful tho
It’s like that video The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon
never seen it
i just looked on google maps, i didnt realize how close my dads place in chicago is to UIC
UIC and uchi are in terrible locations because now they can really only build up
they turned the crack shack into a mueseum
And then they turned it into a museum?
dunno
I just sort their videos by comedian now bc it’s rlly hit or miss if you watch it all
i wonder how working from home has changed it, given you cant exactly do skits
wasnt that like some nick horror mocie
Unfortunately
No one seems to get the brand of social media horror right and I doubt anyone ever will
its cuz the old execs see phone bad
where phone bad
Never seen it
I can’t remember any horror movies I watched
dont be scared of the dark
be scared of whats in the dark
I’m never scared of the dark actually just the inability to see what could possibly be there
which is what they wanted to do with that blindfold movie
Oh ummmm
cuz well
I thought they just went to a school for the blind or smth
im the worst tho with movies cuz i hate plotholes
tho u should watch shaun of the dead
That’s the one w zombies isn’t it
rip proper dave
didnt even have a chance
I wanna rewatch the series but don’t wanna go thru the work of pirating
i've watched some sites before when i dont want to torrent anything
cuz he can and will fuck you if he gets the chance
for me its 10, and companion is either donna, k-9, or martha
martha cuz she is the only one who knew when to stop traveling
and not die or get lost, or have memories errased
especially the dudes, since you know, the writers want the girl to have a crush
cuz as a dude
i know im dead
As a female companion I’d hope I go Donna and quit while I’m ahead but I’d probably end up in some crazy shit like Clara
tho the new one
i dont know why
Oh I didn’t watch
but the writing sucks
I heard the newest ones suck
Capaldi also got weird bc of Clara tho
Season 9 ending was really good tho
The episode where he’s stuck in the fort or something
*spoilers*
||aparently, the doctor is a god and can never die and all the established lore was thrown out the window in the new series||
Oh Bruh
I doubt they’ll be able to make a comeback from that one
Like 10th doctors idk which seasons those r
Oh
oh im dumb
I couldn’t watch thru all of eccelston it just seemed too old for me lol
Bc it’s so focused on his companions that you lose the man
No the 11th doctor sorry
Oh
I don’t think I’ll ever finish old who
cuz that scarf tho
doctor never had a limit
Which season are you taking about?
I heard it’s really bad
i dont anymore
hard
Yea I get why they don’t want a limit bc infinite series but eh
I got off the board when I was told the doctor wouldn’t b w Clara
cuz it keeps the mystery
They could’ve just bsed another excuse near the end of his next set of regens
it sucks for eccelston tho
he ended it with bad terms
ye, he quit cuz the upper management was treating the workers like shit
so he tried sticking up for them
which makes me give him mad props
most stars dont stick up for the little guy
like the series was dead for a long time
with bad wolf, the ood, and a whole range of villians
Rogues gallery of bad boys
Some of their better episodes are the ones where they fuck with history
well, i have no reason to believe this didnt happen
cuz u need that 8h o sleep
I do get 8 hrs
idk if i'm reading it wrong b ut that doesn't look like 8 hours it looks like 11
I guessed on like, 10 of them and got over that amount wrong ffffff
the math on
Def need the refresher anyway it’s been too long since I mathed
But on the bright side because I’m over that shit I can now focus all of my energy on writing why I hate that article
i forgot everything
Why work hard to have brain when no brain is a perfectly valid option
but there will be no changes to tuition cost regardless if online or not, so big rip
she also mentioned that orientation is still being figured out
as u dont want crowds of people
cant be me rn doe
dunno, it probably depends on ur classes and stuff
cuz if ur taking multivar, and get a c, they are probably more understanding than if u were in precalc and get a c
mine went all p/f
im surprised more places didnt go p/f tho
What my school did was oddly specific
Didn’t do anything at all is a fail
my district cannot fail a student
so you can do basically no work
But they can’t fail you this marking period
I don’t think that’s fair but I digress
Yea the way our district had it is so you’re encouraged to do work but if you can’t b at full capacity for whatever reason you’re not penalized
In my district for 4th quarter you can’t get a lower grade than what you got in Q3
god I wish
Idk
Also that awk moment when your head in your photo ID card pic is ever so slightly tilted when it’s technically not supposed to be😳 how tilted does your head have to be for it to be denied 😂😂
You can still see my whole face no doubt but like
Idk how stingy they are with the requirements
My senior portrait background is dark so I couldn’t have used that rip
It hasn’t been approved yet
Idk why
Cuz it’s one of the few photos I was wearing a tie in and looked awake
is my hair naturally straight? nope 😳
My id photo was accepted but I just realized my afro was uneven
And I never took senior pictures rip
Oh that’s not bad tho
The other one I lost in the street then I got it back
I think my photo is zoomed in idk
I hated not being able to do that in middle school and high school
i took my with a close up on my face so all my acne is on there 🤢
cant be me
im not that close
I got mine 2 weeks ago? And I live in this shit hole
I just got in this school lmaoaoa
god damn it
So cold
I’ve spent the whole day in my house
my mom doesnt believe in ac
"the air is cooler outside"
My mom says we should have almost the same temperature inside as outside
cuz no ac in dorms
My ac broke last summer
Worst thing ever
It broke TWICE
i litterly have a fan about 2 feet away as its too hot without it
isnt it weird how ur foot is aslong as ur forearm
wrong chat
how... have i never noticed
he'd be dead
and u can digest razorblades, tho i wouldnt reccomend trying
too late
Wtf you all can register for classes
that would be wierd, since i havent even finshed that sages thing
it’s not i tried
can’t
unfortunately
im sorry meg 😦
i went to go wash my face
and instead of putting soap on my face
brain doesnt like us clearly
on another note, whats the possibilities of a #quotes channel, i have a few saved up from yesterday
say this brain broke
:rip:
oh
cuz context is very evil
i guess that’s what pins are for tho right
i wish anyone could pin but that could be too much power
gotta win those league games tho
i dont think so
so what im hearing, find some rats and live forever :P
isnt it the year of the rat tho
indeed, tho our future sucks in comparison to others
they might be mice i can’t remember
*sad time travel noises*
that and camera trickery
and delete the stupid ones i made
idk how to delete channels
they arent stupid, just served their purpose
rip general 2.0
i've never used mobile, cool to know
YOUVE NEVER USED MOBILE
no, i do most my stuff on pc
if u need to contact me, feel free to call or text, i dont really have social media
go a head
a head
go 4 it, if u dont wana make 1
when roman tells u to be a head
he didnt get head, thats why
cuz quotes r memes
idk how to rearrange them
u should be able to drag
i tried to do the sort channels thing but it wouldn’t let me smh gonna have to get on my computer
don’t tell roman
just u gotta hope it dont kill u
well u shouldnt
cuz well
there is a way to prepare it so it doesnt
that shit slaps
idk who came up with it but it really hits different
tho i've become lazy, i put some pb on cellery and then get a handful of rasians
but rhubarb itself adds color to the food, correct me if im wrong
rip my mitchells ice cream
too tasty to last
howdy did u know mitchells sells their ice cream in tubs at grocery stores?! I didn't know that until v recently
cuz the store adds more charge for holding
That's true but see, mitchells is closed and those tubs are available...
mitchels isnt closed
i got the pint on monday
I'm confused what ppl kept telling me the mitchells in beachwood is closed...
so i never went...
rip
coffee and alcohol couldnt be me
idk my ochem teacher gave us a recipe for his spiked coffee
haven't tried it yet
sorry, not a weeb, whats the translation?
dont search it up
To each their own. I'm a PC guy and if I were to get a Mac I'd run Windows on it. XPS 15 gang 💪
Also has anyone who has requested to join any of the snap groups of Facebook actually got in? I haven't and I only found out today that I'm not searchable by people without my contact info
couldnt be me
SpaceX is tomorrow can't be tired for that glory
My dad is taking half the day off from work for that LOL
it's why I'm not on mobile rn, my phone exploded...
rip
Nothing much. Hby?
might go to bed soon tho
Whoops, can't ever remember if it's plus or minus 11.5 hours to india
and i wake up 3 hours later... after albert says gn
How can anyone sleep more than 8 hours a day?
I can sleep a decent 8-10 hours anytime
i havent slept yet
Shannon has gone full nocturnal at this point
I just go to sleep late and wake up at 8
my parents are still trying 😞
closer to college
i just did 4/7 missing stats assignments yeet
I just did not sleep much in college
Shannon I feel like
Asian parents step off the gas once u get into college
That seems to be a common theme at least from the ppl I’ve talked to
My parents let go junior year
But it’s different since my older sister was already in college so they felt like they were basically done
My mom is the only one who genuinely cares about my sleep. Once I was up til ~2 am~ studying for a test and she came in my room and gave me a long lecture about the importance of sleep and how she doesn’t want me sleep-deprived
i called them but he said he would’ve called me if i didn’t call him
bc theyre able to look at ur application so they have your number
This isn’t loss is it
I don’t think so
I didn’t know how cute my next door neighbors were
But everything else is chill it’s even raining which is great
I have never had poutine outside of like Quebec
i don't like gravy
I have yet to eat a poutine I liked but I don’t hate it as a concept
Awww ur missing out
i don't really see it that way
Fair
Ppl always say I miss out on hating cheese
you're not missing out on anything if you don't like it
because i'm allergic to a lot of shit
"oh you're allergic to peanuts? you're missing out"
I don’t think I’m allergic to anything but who knows
Nah peanuts aren’t much
I could easily live without them
i mean i've literally never eaten one so it's no loss
Yea can’t miss things you never had
i always just get "damn that sucks"
idk i outgrew my allergies so i have both experiences and I've always gotten "you're missing out" or "damn i wish you could have this"
i developed mine so pizza's a pretty big miss
but other than that it's not that bad tbh
Agreed. I lived like most of my life until middle school allergic to most shit under the sun and like after middle school it like went away but i don't think my life is better off now that i have no food allergies
Sorry I meant pollen
Yeah all my food allergies migrated into the worst seasonal allergies in the world
That's a big rip
i've never used it
oh
idk i'm anti meds
I don't take meds?
Like when i have a fever/cold I just kinda suck it up
Oh dang
Well cuz i mean i have a body and i don't want to make it weak by taking meds
Ohhh so you don’t take meds because of your preference?
Oh no, i just dont believe in taking them unless im dying
I usually try to avoid medication too unless it’s really bad
catch me popping 4 advil every time i get a headache 🤪
I just pop some motrin when I'm hungry for a snack
I don’t taste the medicine
One time I left an Advil liqui-gel in my mouth for too long and lemme tell you
I hate the artificial cherry flavor in those cough syrups though
Everyone hates that
Artificial cherry or grape makes me sick
can’t do it
The cough syrup though
I like the cherry and grape flavors tho 😩
Cherry is shit
I just pinch my nose
That I can still taste it
nah fam my parents used to have to pin my bitch ass down and make me swallow grape medicine
Don’t even get me started on the aftertaste
That shit tastes like aids
I’ve never had cough syrup but is it rlly that bad? It just seems like thick fruit juice
I don’t even know who came up with that flavor
Some is bad
The artificial cherry flavor is bad
i hated my life when i couldnt take pills
I could not live without Tylenol.
Why couldn’t have we stuck to the regular fruit flavors lol
My headaches would kill me
^^!! Except my mom told me a home remedy that works like a blessing
And boom in less than 15 minutes the cramps are gone
Oh apparently the English translation is ajowan? Idk
The only cramps I ever got in my life was when I had to down a couple burritos at Taco Bell for a fundraiser and the next day my stomach was literally vibrating
Taco Bell has sooooo much sodium it’s actually bad
same reason i cant eat ramen, 50% of ur daily salt intake in one small thing si insanse
tho, for survival reasons, the reason it was made, its real useful
lasts long, can be eaten with or without water
Idk how to eat processed ramen
Because they both do not work well so
Yeah I didn’t have chopsticks
But I had that from like the ages of 7-13 and I hated that shit
rip
Surprised you would be on it for so long b/c of the addictiveness
Then again others are worse
i cant swallow
In the Dayton Ohio more ppl died of an overdose than COVID in April
My daily meds is like 8 pills I would hate to take that all in liquid
Idk why some ppl from my hs go to university of Dayton
isnt that a religous school
It’s like Marquette but worse
my friend who wanted to join the airforce went there
his peanut alergy said no tho
well too bad ron
cuz we get suckered into joining the draft
when we apply for college
Yea rip to men
Couldn’t b me
Like the one time it sucks to be a guy
I would be exempted anyway but the idea is bad enough
Idk I think unwanted erections suck
I just think there’s probably more than one way where being a man would suck
But still harder to be a women than a man
Unwanted elections suck
Man I was really searching for an acronym
That’s for the most expensive housing tho
oh duh
beth, its cuz the apartments
It ain’t Harvard
But still
dunno
english is boring, u heard it here first
Sophomore dorms are apparently worse than freshman
rip
u get bad dorms freshmen year
even worse dorms next year
Hilarious that they expect me to stay after 2 years of bad dorms
Isn’t that a podcast
it doesnt
The bad parts grow on you
CWRU has private security at night tho
Oh yeaaa
i repay for all the stuff we didnt get this year qq
WHY ARE YOU EVEN EMAILING ME, I NEVER APPLIED THERE
I don’t remember how the Mitchell’s I had tasted so I need a redo
Omg I hate getting emails from random colleges

frick, i still havent done that essay, i need to do it
Those sound great wtf
I need to staff a list of restaurants I want to hit up in cle
Rip
You’re missing barrio
Aw noice
Texas de Brazil isn’t good tho
I’ve been to it cuz it’s near my house and it’s not gooddd
How far away is it from case?
I feel like terminal tower is a very long walk tho
i wouldnt reccomend walk tho, cuz its west side
if ur feeling real exercisy, u can bike
I’ve only done divvy in Chicago twice and it wasn’t bad
go for it if u want, i just dont feel right paying to rent a bike that kinda sucks for a bike
bus tho
And idk biking laws in cle not gna risk it
K so if anyone wanna go to the Market w me within like, the first 3 weeks of school I’m totally down
if they dont  close down everything again
Man what’s the point in even being on campus if almost everything around isn’t open
i kinda want to watch
I’m not much of a rioting person myself but it do feel a lil cathartic
cuz i like food
Except bibibop is overrated imo
Or I just got sick of it
its nothing more than asian chipotle
but are tired of burritos
But the last month of school I went there once a week
And I got sick of it
And this drunk guy was talking to my friends and I.. super sad he was like talking about his mixtape and how his addiction prevented him from pursuing his dreams
6’1 in shoes b/c I got flat feet
Lol rip
But still
Do not wish to be tall. It sucks
its fat people than are generally more disliked
short (says 6'5)
My grandpa is like why aren’t you dating
short kings
Which is bad... don’t date based on height
Yeah Meg wtf
i hate being short but at least every man ever is taller than me
wish i could
That be bad
isnt the average height for girls 5'8 tho?
So short
Julis I feel you
You will he short compared to me
Omg 🙈

Carly is 5’5 yet she still bullies me 😡
Oh I didn’t kno there’s an Ideal

which means, beth, u gotta find some more 6'5 people
We will find out Tuesday
oh noes
I feel like basketball has a bunch of tall dudes
with not even his full hand
I want to improve my shoe collection
But idk
it’s a never ending cycle
rip
I was really hoping for yeezys
We can’t be friends
But it’s a joke... I don’t like Stan smiths
fair
I legit am far from expert but I ordered both and tried them on
$200 for shoes rip
lmk when u  find some $20 cuz thats about in my budget
I am sponsored by kswiss tho

I just work as a tennis instructor and the place is sponsored by kswiss
But I want a Wilson sponsorship
vineyard vines is more boujee tho
not as bad as the goose coats
but bad
I haven’t played tennis in 4 months because quarantine
So rip
Yo I want to fence
well dont u just need a long stick
I was thinking about getting another epee blade so someone can use my old one 😳
Ron that’ll work
So my friend got this terrible smoothie and I was going to prank her by saying I got a gift and give her that
No I don’t think that’s too mean
how does one mess up a smoothie that bad
needs more ls
Omg insomnia cookies??
Mojito without alcohol is like orange juice without oranges
Like it’s bad
Also meg scared me once
oh fair
Like wtf because I couldn’t see their face
Also didn’t recognize the voice
But also like I didn’t really talk to them 1st sem
But we aren’t that close
Beth don’t feel bad, whenever I wear shorts ppl remember me as the guy with the calves and hairy legs
Yeah idk
Being tall sucks
Sorry I had to
I don’t have hairy legs so I cannot relate
Literally being tall isn’t that bad
I rarely grow hair that isn’t on my head
Being forced to not wear shorts is worse
mostly bad thing, but things nonetheless
Nah u don’t want this hair
Shit I misread that and I was about to say that was very sexual
beth, u need to go to switzerland or something where the average height is like 6'5
Study abroad maybe
Sorry some trauma
So it was so annoying
Like wtf
i was like, dont normally people see ur head, its kinda there
Also my favorite of leggings got stuck in the door and they ripped
Rip
rip
I was sad
arent leggings like sweatpants tho
Which idk was a thing
I don’t ever use it unless it’s hot and I’m out for awhile
I wanted ultra boosts since frosh year hs
I got them frosh year of college
I just want some sturdy fashion boots
Timbs don’t fit my fashion much
I hate their logo
Idk like ppl stomping boots, that’s what I like
I just don’t think they’re practical
They aren’t
Yea docs r expensive tho
You will never see me in them
they are winter and rain boots, for temps to -40, very nice
I wanted to buy oxfords from doc for prom but thank goodness I didn’t
tho starting to wear down from like 5yrs of use
big sad when they are done for
I hate converse
The first pair of converse I threw away did make me shed a tear tho
I don’t like wearing them personally
But I don’t think of ppl differently for
Oh mine aren’t doin too bad
Idk quality is important
Why you don’t buy nmds
im assumeing is cuz people think "counter culture"
I don’t do anything so my converse last forever
I need to bring white shoes to college rip
I hate my white dress shoes
that seems much to pure
Public school too
I miss the coffee from there tho
Pretend like I didn’t say that
Idk but I woke up and I was like I miss this
same, if i need energy, i eat something
Energy drinks suck
An ineffective form of caffeine and apparently doesn’t even taste good
College
tho no caffine for me in mine
I can’t drink black teas on an empty stomach
I barely add sweetness to my tea anymore
I’m trying to get serious abt my tea
tho the beachwood mall is starting to fall from the boujee place they pretend to be
so i wonder how long it will last
I haven’t been to one in years
well, not so much anymore
given everything is closed
I hate buying online if it’s not already for something I know I need but some ppl just do it all online
cuz what if they dont fit
yet chipotle
Shit time to cut my hair and superglue it to my legs
I think there’s hair on my legs but it’s not enough to be noticeable or cared abt
You can have my leg hair I don’t want it anymore
feels bad man
If I lose my hair that’s a wrap
I spent too much money on this bitch for it to leave me
My dad just shaves his head to maintain pride
Maintaining waves is a whole different type of stress tho
Arent they technically...both the same thing...?
or u cant handle spice :thonk:
idk my parents just said "want thai thai for dinner" and i said sure
Yeah you totally just disappointed all the Asians on here
Damn I do be disappointing my fellow Asians out here 😔
rip
Is it bad I haven’t done work for my job yet
i havent done anything
I haven’t done anything
imagine still being in school
couldn't be me
I am taking summer school
I don’t think imma be able to handle it tbh
Idk I haven’t had another TA meeting
i have a class that starts on monday reee
damn, they pushing it back a whole two months
Oh shit that’s no good
They can’t do that
Cuz how’re they gonna choose who doesn’t stay on campus
But the bathrooms tho
Ik it isnt good
Honestly, i wouldnt care though if we had to take another year off
more relaxation and not giving a fuck about school
senioritis hit me hard
its probably going to be a 15/85 for off/on line school
its probably for those who dont have a stable internet connection
So that you don't pull out the cash
The school can't run without tuition money
cuz i feel there are going to be drops after this
They will still charge the same price
You guys were already in school
Yeah I mean this is really bad
But its NCAA, so im hopin we'd get a year of eligibility back
I mean, per the head coach
everything is still moving ahead
but he said its still evolving, and that it could change overnight
i’m about to get an apartment in cle just to feel like i’m on campus in the fall 😩😩
Want to be roommates
Jk, im fuckin broke
okay true but if they don’t charge us room and board
Margaux Greek life is gonna die if we go online lol
idk your situation tho so, dont mind my opinion
truuu, but if you're not going to be at school then..... idk :cursed_flushed:
ya idk i prob wont do it since id literally be alone
just feeling like it is worth all dat money? I mean, you could save that money for a fuckin carrrrr
if i were by myself in cle then im just... lonely
Yeah don’t do that
lmao, find someone on here and split the rent w them
Cuz ur classmates aren’t gonna be there
Bye Margaux
beth that’s only if we don’t go back
i just need to leave my house lol
No I feel you
I probs going to visit my brother if we don’t go back
Because it would be 6 months
Also like I miss his best friend’s cat
Gatherings larger than 5 tho is risky
This fucking sucks
Anyone take an antibody test yet
ahh, I see, but i saw on the news, it has like only a 50% of working
lmao, what if u dont got the antibodies
then you cant teach?
Is that still gonna happen
but knowing how most administrations work
I mean it’d b a pretty big loss to cut room and board like that
Hope they don’t find my white collar crime
they wont
they never do
I was already pretty set on not being on campus for health reasons as long as it doesn’t affect whatever they’re doing for nursing clinicals
how can u see if ur eyes arent real
I mean I use glasses so my eyes never see anything to begin with
and then u have fim who wants to see it all
the 3rd one looks like annoying orange if they took serious amounts of drugs
Is the annoying orange still a thing
Never could watch more than one video per sitting
Aw man I forgot all about him
there were still some games
well, they clelebrated 10yrs last year, so i consider 09
Fair
the wii was probably one of the biggest things tho
Might just buy one and fuck around
i still have mine
Oh shit
Nintendo really peaked with the wii
the wii is their 3rd most sold console
I missed the whole ds period
Will never forgive my parents for that
and everyone wants or has
The wiiU apparently sucked tho
Which is sad bc that rlly nerfed any chances of a new wii product
the wiiu is a much worse version of a switch
ye, nintendo tax sucks
tho i do have slime rancher
So this poor Xbox has been sitting here for like 3-4 years collecting dust
wtf is an "enriching game"
They for sure don’t bc they gave up on all of that when I hit sophomore year
its probably not compatible, but the two game i still play on xbone, is Lovers and slime rancher
vtech, isnt that the leapster stuff
the one thing i miss is my white lightsaber
That’s the one I had but I didnt scroll far enough
but it was still the kid plastic hit people with it
i dont know what happened to it, but that was the coolest lightsaber ever
Oh I used to watch a family friend play 64, he never let me touch it tho
i want to make one at thinkbox that is an rf remote
till everyone is dead
Until someone changes them for personal preference then I’m fucked
I am half asleep
Oh I heard you went to the same school as them
well ur in luck, they were popular, cuz i couldnt tell u most of who was in my class
its kinda hard to listen to 1st 1st world problems
why, they no longer popular @ case?
Howdy you have yet to still guess which Hawken person I went to prom yet lol
m8, they wanted .like 100 for prom
some rich kid is my guess
US was 250 cry me a river
which doesnt narrow it down
cuz covid cancelled senior year prom
Society has evolved past the need for prom
why would i go pay money to stand in a room of people i dont know
would rather sleep in
and given i dont know anyone
they dont know me
The fact that I didn’t take senior pictures is big brained bc now I’m not in yearbook and no one will remember me
i had a photo freshman year cuz my mom wanted one
but since then, nothing
imagine existing, couldnt be me
next year, all that will be left is the stuff in my locker cuz school closed down
I have nothing in my locker
Leave no trace
Rip
we got to go in to school today and take everything, so nothing remains
Aw man imma miss the kids selling chips n cookies
and since i can tip the vending machines
Oh snapppp
u didnt hear that btw ;)
Dang I’ll miss gas station culture
during a class last year
the teacher let us out cuz everyone wanted sprite cranberry
My school has two gas stations across the street the floodgates opening when schools over was the worst
I’d just walk out the school 5 minutes early and go bc wtf are they gonna do?? Tell me to go back to class with 5 minutes left?
The best thing is a designated person you just hand them the money and they get what u want
There’s dds and those who bought in bulk and sold them during school hours
Will take a hot Cheetos and cheese if available tho
fair
All my taco needs is onion and cilantro and both salsas
without cheese
wtf
I’ll probably gain intolerance anyway due to my talk of ingesting them
ron, are u sure ur not, cuz u gotta hate all dairy for a reason
what i didn't know is that ppl pronounce syrup rlly weird sometimes
and the hard r vs the soft
I kno someone who says sigh-rup
rip
Hate it
that's the worst
how tho
Apparently gym shoes is like a midwest thing
I can’t talk to you anymore
Idk the difference
sneakers seem to imply more of the soft padded shoes
that are breathable and u dont mind getting trashed
so neel, what are we ohioans supposed to say
that's fair
i feel like everyone around here alternates between sneakers and tennis shows
Internet has made it sorta obsolete
i think im technically listed as undecided though
Wait I cannot add roles on my phone rip
ye, we're much to close for him to act like some form of gangster
ur friends probably have inside jokes tho
I like when a term will get taken like chile and then it’s taken back but only used in the sarcastic way
well i dont :thonk:
OH
Sorry instinct kicked in
we're trying to break that stereotype
Idk bruh go wolverines
bc NU SUCKS
Want to throw hands Neel
Okay howdy just bc my school makes me wear khakis and a button down doesnt mean i like wearing it
liberty is really nearby me
Just cos i go to an all guys school doesn't mean we're weird
Idk the catholic school by me has a similar dress code
Single gender schools still exist??
HB isn't tho
Big rip
US isn't weird bruh
Ur just mad cos we beat u in sports
No gas station culture tho
Oh boi
no we didn't
and ya'll be so far into the woods, the poor cant even breath on ya
what the fuck
Oh god a single gender school in the woods??
There’s mountain school
Island school
Fights were part of the Vibes tho
Howdy one of the kids in ur school stuck their dick in a trophy
yeah so don't even talk fam
cuz they sued the school
cuz they rich
Oh mygodddd
Man I wish I was 17
Decided not to do shit thinking I could go out w my friends more
Yet, alas,
big rip
Idk why that was a pic but ok
yeah bruh his school is 100 times weirder than mine
Nah furries don’t stop with fox tails
Need the whole suit
what really happened
Okay that really happened dude.
I just left out some details
cuz doxxing
So i mean u don't have to tell us
No sticking dicks in trophies anymore : (
the head of our school is a lesbian
ur saying that like it's a bad thing
what the fuck
that didn't happen what
lied and said it never happened
That’s gotta count as some form of harassment tho
never heard of it
Omg folklore
My friend who left junior year told me about it
the theatre girls tho howdy are straight snacc's tho
and neel, i wouldnt know, i've never seen a show
cuz they cost money
I just went for the experiecne
Oh
And I hate saying no to people
I mean it’s not a boarding school is it
Yea that’s just math
We don't prevent dudes from getting it on with dudes if they so choose
rip
I’d say big mood but I can’t
isnt there that meme
fair enough
The shop in which u work on things
I feel like I’m witnessing the warm fuzzies section of the camp experience
tho our chinese department
fair enough
1st teacher left substitute left put us in online classes but I think everyone’s failing it
ye, our school cant hold on to any of them
alot of subs and teachers who cant teach
Bc if u can’t help someone w Chinese in English you won’t get anywhere
it did the rounds in the school, but im not sure outside ofit
But i didn't see any dicks
no, there was a parody film make, i guess it didnt breach the school
a what school?
before this i never had this kind of drama
oh governers school
What did I miss
It is a public school technically
nope
But also worse
There’s too much
I need a week to read all that
I really dont know why I read that shit post
Okay *ahem* so this kid in my grade junior year decided it would be a good idea to bring bread into the middle of our commons area. He then claims he's going to make "homemade mayo" before our very eyes. In the span of a minute he begins FAPPING against a wall (teachers were on their lunch break) and he does his thing between two slices of bread in front of all us juniors (and some seniors looking at us like wtf you all are doing) and we can SEE the white goop and he takes a bite of it
I do hate that very very much
I mean thats the most scandalous thing howdy but it doesnt compare to dick trophy
That’s p bad
I think cum sandwich is worse than dick trophy
That’s so gross tho
Yea I’m eating dinner but I’ve seen worse
Though the intention behind dick trophy for lesbian principal is probably worse
I think I’m gonna smash my phone and bleach my eyeballs now
i mean the cum sandhwich must've been yummy cuz he ate it all up
if cant take the eat
Someone wanna talk about candy or some shit
Sorry this is a bad time
when we dont lose it at 11pm
My day was good, but now idk anymore
I don’t remember my day
i now know i need to show ron the wonders of dairy
I can fw any dairy that isn’t cheese
couldnt be me
@gabriellefinnegan lol I wish that was ur nickname tho
she brings us the left over from time to time
thats we all need to find a trust fund kid
She had a kid during one of their summer weeks who left an entire keurig
Imagine 1) buying a keurig machine bc u want a specific coffee during a student week and 2) leaving it bc u don’t want to haul it anywhere
Didn’t even bring it
Just wanted their keurig coffee fuckin bought one
I want a disposable income like that
I like what bezos exwife did of divorcing and then left with as much money as she could
My sister has been trying and failing to find bill gates son on campus
But the gates don’t seem like the type to give all their money to their kids
doesn't she go to a music conservatory now?
Conservatories seem like hell
I think the only videos I have abt/from my school is our black history month presentation
oh noes
oh
my school is as mentioned before
Oh yea our school is 98% black u cannot fail bhm there
if they arent well exucuted
Yes they go all out I’ll miss it
there was the chick one year who had moving wings in her costume
thats sucks
Never did trick or treating
Wanna attempt in college but idk how that works
Religious parents do take away fun tho
thats a rip
Howdy I don’t rip
Rip
Im Bored
Just go to sleep
I can’t I still need to finish my letter to my advisor ✊🤪
Idk if your advisors read the letter tbh
probs dont
When’s the letter due?
The letter is due midnight at est right?
expect for those who have no internet
or bad homes
So there’s nothing opening this month end?
seems nothing special on the 1st, just things throughout the month
case doesnt want to say online school
probably hasnt been updated
case doesnt want to say online classes
with no reduction due to online
not edge tho
what about internet explorer?
I get too bored to want to take a gap year
as some people will not have internet
buffer rooms won’t make a difference tbh
wtf is buffer rooms o.o
how substantial would it be at reducing bathroom cooties? idk, just an interesting thought
we need some stats people
math majors wya
sorry for being a bit critical btw, I just always feel weird about whenever people make corona assumptions
im trying to base em off as much fact as i can
i think it’s too far away to make any guesses
as they still are deciding
and wont tell till they have come to a complete agreement
i dont think any firm decisions will b made until july
True, but do you think it's really possible to determine accurate reductions in cootie spread based on dorming plans?
we could adopt purdues model of no fall break, classes end on thanksgiving and online finals
housing isn’t much of an issue for everyone but freshman
as i've spent much time there already
we talked about current plans
this is true, they are probably calculating the most students that can take a gap year without hurting their paycheck
apparently national guard is attacking people
i wonder how much manpower they will be able to combat
and when it does happen. this won’t just be a riot in one city
well, i guess we found out what happens when people go stir crazy
Really?
Damn
it moved up to columbus last i heard
Chicago hasn’t tried too much we’re all scared of Ms Lightfoot
That’s too much work
Go hit up a target instead
I haven’t been to a target in ages
Forgot nyc
rip
looks like they broke into the police station
I can’t go out but I have my bailout piggy bank for my friends
Esp since the police r claiming that none of their weapons were used
the police will claim whatever they want to claim
Wouldn’t put it past some creepy Americans just discharging bullets tho
D homies said they aren’t doing anything yet
i wish i had a good camera, footage of this would be nice
thankfully, im already near invisible
Oh yea I’m just wondering how much damage we’ll do
Oh my godddd
Oh
I cannot believe this isn’t scripted
damn
Nah it’s just 3am they still sleep
it was 4am the other day, when i was desperately trying to not pull an all nighter
The worst part is is that I need to be up around 9
So I can attempt to force myself to sleep m get 6 hours or see if I can last
not 6hrs, but waking up at 9
If I can’t hit up the stores right after the boomer hour I don’t go
fair tbh
my mommy instacarts that shit
I can’t find it in myself to online shop groceries
Lol I get it tho
Even tho I’m not buying any fresh produce this time around it doesn’t feel right to just order it online
four years of funky textures doesnt sound bad
I need to consume all of the cereal within the first 5 minutes of adding milk
I still need substantial Cronch
Oh I used to
Not much anymore
Don’t eat Mac n cheese
Used to put ketchup on rice tho
I feel like there’s weirder combos than ketchup and a starch
Peanut butter on pickles is like veggies n dipping sauce so I can’t be too critical
Ooooo that gave me a bad imaginary mouthfeel
I don’t like peanut butter but I get the appeal of peanut butter + crunchy veggie
Aw geckos
today i walked like 1.5 hours to take a conspiracy theorist photo in fromt of a cell phone tower, with a tinfoil hat
the only exciting thing that happened today
@rainbright8 isnt it morning over there?
I made the wrong decision of trying to sleep for 4 hours
Is housing not opening on June 1st anymore??
Nope it’s July 21st now I think
I haven't shaved in months now, my beard is getting pretty long at this point
I’m with Gabrielle, mine still shows June 1 on the roadmap and my portal
Probably didn’t update it
They haven’t been doin that already??
i just looked at the news
In Louisville people were shot but we don’t exactly know if they were cops or not
My guess is undercover ones that they won’t claim
oh, there was some video of cops shooting from inside their armored van
i really wish i was a artys person who knew how to take photos, cuz this is prime realstate
took it on her iphone
yeah but i mean she isn't either
I dont know why but boredom hit hard today, even tho i have that essay to write
also beth how u feel about me visiting u one day
As long as your 6 feet apart
The other one hurt my ears
Although I haven't made the ear thing specifically, the NIH has an online repo
Pokécord Is Shutting Down

Hey everyone, I'm sorry to announce that effective immediately, Pokécord is shutting down.

It's been a wild ride, going from a project I used to learn to code to one of the biggest bots on Discord used by millions of people in almost 1.3 million servers. For this I'd like to give a huge thank you to everyone who made it possible by playing and sharing the bot with their friends.

Unfortunately this unexpected growth also comes with a lot of added work and stress, and after two and a half years of maintaining and updating the bot, it's with a heavy heart that I've decided to bring it to an end and move on to other projects.

Thank you all once again for joining us on this journey.

For any problems or questions, the support@pokecord.com email will remain active until July 1st.
this is the worst day of my life
Idk if my parents will let me come back rip
I wonder how many people won't come back though? I'm guessing like...all of the international students will stay at home/in their countries
Also if there’s an option a lot of ppl can save $ and/or for me my parents said depending on my class material why would increase exposure unless I have to
Same but I highly doubt my parents would let me live on campus in the fall since I don’t live terribly far from it
My WiFi is killing itself
Idk what that means tbh
rip
what my friend saw after the riots ended in cleveland
then the cops started shooting, and chaos broke
so it was hard for people to leave in less than 5min
yeah they even lifted the bridges so my friend is stuck in downtown still
that's what he's worried about, so he's debating swimming across the river
there is a strech of river which is very short
tho i dont reccomend swimmign
His car is on the other side
careful, ships are able to go down that river for a reason
he said that at the Foundry (the crew place) the river shouldn't be too deep
will do! rip Gabe
i was working
I stayed for the first hour of mine got tired n went home
i cant believe they raised all the bridges
that is trying to keep people in to arrest them
I think it was his bad, he stayed back to survey the aftermath
I mean there wasn’t much of a point in shutting things off idk abt cle but we were basically done and ready to leave when they started to close everything
and i assume the non moving bridge is swarming with cops
There are apparently no boats right now on the river
I don’t think theyve raised the bridges
I mean if they’re not gna restart transport or lower bridges it doesn’t matter how much time they give
HE MADE IT
BUT HIS CAR HAS A BOOT ON IT
RIP
he might be able to pop it off
This shit is crazy man
he drives a pickup so he straight up just started driving and it popped off apparently after they kicked it
its 12 hours
Columbus’ is 8 hours
One of my dad’s friend’s store’s windows were broken
he should be able to go south
and then cut across
near slavic village
was he able to take 90? or going down to 480?
He was able to get onto 42 actually and he's merging onto the *interstate*
sorry i have to use correct terminology
idk but from the snaps he's sending me there is quite a bit of traffic considering it's curfew and 10 on a saturday
wtf
Wtf
What’s up with this Anonymous shit tho
I wanna be a first gen iPhone
It didn’t say July 31st
whoops 😔 sorry everyone
setting it to be july 31st tho
that’s probably the worst idea imaginable, that would be the case if we were moving in in, like, October
Or at least I heard that from someone
Anyone else just feel so tired for no reason
fair
heres hoping
I don’t see the July 31 housing date anywhere
Lmao I didn’t click on the right thing, ok
iPhone keyboard is too small
It’s too much work tho
@everyone please someone dm me question or something I am bored as fuck.
Isn’t that why they deactivated the ping
cuz some people dont know
tho chips and salsa
we're out of the hot stuff, so im using medium, but still a tasty thing
Idk anything abt transformers
I wanted a yellow chevy camarro with a black stripe for a long time, just because of bumblebee
cuz its straight 80s right there
tho speaking about cars u want
No the second picture isn't G1 Jazz, that's from a newer cartoon that I don't know the name of because I gave up keeping track of Transformers long ago
The car was never street-legal
Even though I know they’re not as good as the competition on paper, the interior just really appeals to me
Oop just got banned on Snapchat for jailbreaking my phone
Rip
seems sus
Idk I wasn’t even using any tweaks that affected snap
Oh well rip my streaks 😔
@spartan010 aye sick did you do the new 13.5 jailbreak?
Also if you all did NOT (my life hates me) get one that is not good
Oh f
u mean if u didnt get one
or someone was mugged
or when u need to avoid buildings if there have been lab accidents or something
Yeah that’s why I was trying to say it’s not good if you don’t get it
But my autocorrect hates me
Almost forgot bc of everything going but let’s go gays 🥳🏳️‍🌈
we still straight over here 😔
M sorry to hear that 😞
but ur no longer a child so rip
sadly it works 😔
Yea but there’s so many variations for some flags skittle doesn’t want that type of fire
Ya hate to hear it
shit u know ur up late when the sun starts rising
it really does ()_()
all it needs is a few flowesrs and its there
They’re supposed to have something in October but I doubt it’s happening still
wheres everyone tho
damn
Does that not scream Pitch Perfect when Fat Amy (aka Fat Patrica) got hit by a burrito
anyone have their meeting thing yet?
dont you have to meet them?
i dont rly want to
I see it as, if youdont have more pressing things to do, it doesnt hurt to talk, and first impressions and all that. However if you are swamped with work, its not the highest priority
It's a nice chance to get to know your navigator. Mine at least was swamped as soon as classes started, and our meetings were pretty structured and short. In our summer call, I was able to get to know her without really any restrictions on time.

I also was pretty sure what I wanted to major in, so it was quite helpful to get her impression on my (first semester, at the very least) course plans and suggestions on people to reach out to for more info. And then after that call, I felt a lot more comfortable emailing her questions and such 🙂
i rescheduled from last week bc i slept thru my meeting 🤧
this sucks
It’s there if you want it but it is not a state school
I never knew how much I needed sports until they were gone
My fav comics store is back in operation yeehaw
What’s wrong with cognitive behavioral therapy?
Are they delaying or starting early? Do you happen to know that? 🥺
They’re starting on time but they won’t have in-person classes after thanksgiving for the rest of the semester I believe
What about the second semester tho
Do they have plans for that yet?
dont think so
I didn’t see anything in the article about it
Because we closed for COVID a few days after osu did
> They’re starting on time but they won’t have in-person classes after thanksgiving for the rest of the semester I believe
do u mean until after thanksgiving?
idk how else to interpret
Awww hell nah
It’s bc they don’t know how on campus learning will affect infection rates
So they won’t confirm whether or not they’ll be back on campus after thanksgiving till they find out
they dont want ppl going home thanksgiving break and then heading back to school again
no breaks, rip
They just don’t know if they’ll be in person second semester so they don’t mention it @spartan010
No breaks do suck tho
CWRU still hasn’t announced their plans for the fall yet either
I have a splitting headache
Idk I’m trying to sleep but it’s not working :/
I feel that
are the birds out yet?
like, I can't sleep if I hear birds
No not yet
My brother and his friends are yelling in the room next to me though
I told them to stop but nobody really cares
headache source?
yo dorms arent open yet rihgt
nope
Mine is scheduled as a phone meeting
I had a phone meeting and my navigator called me
mine sent me a zoom link this morning for some reason even though I'm scheduled for a phone meeting
mine was a little late to the zoom
Ok apparently she forgot it was a phone call and she joined in on the zoom link
Didn't learn much tbh, but I already did my research
isnt that just the botanical gardens :thonk:
clean ur inbox pl0x
if long island university stopped emailing me
even though i pressed unsub like 10000000 times
u should be able to set a filter that sends emails from a certain address to trash immediatly
I don't want their actually important emails to go to my trash
I'm surprised you have that much drive
i dont 🙃
would be pain
and still tho
Tru, there is a alot of bad unsubscribe emails
that's sick
Sometime i want to get a proper server and domain
cuz i have tons of bits and pieces everywhere
near 800gb in google drive
damn
Did anyone else here get a weird email about the work study program?
i didnt get one beck
I have a 4tb hdd, but no sata cables to try and see if it still work
ye, my school was decomissioning a server
since it failed
since they were gonna throw it out
yeah, my school switched to AWS a few years ago and the servers are just sitting there
IDK anything about servers, but I'm sure they could be used for something
but i figured the tech guys there would not appricate me trying this
oh, for wifi?
without me having to pay for the internet connections
*tho tbh, if im paying these prices for rooming, its the least they can do*
cuz thats where u need it the most
that would be very annoying
i cant verify it
tho i will say
the lab i was working at in glennan
had no service
tho i did get to strap a gps module to my bike and ride around
i was working under a professor there
i flew some for school
tho the burn through battery like nothing else
if your idiot brother takes it from you while you are on vacation
goes to fly it near a bunch of power lines
and wants to "see how high they can go"
do you want to go into academia?
nah, tho being refered to as doc would be funny, i dont have that kind of money to support that
yeah, I could rant for a while about why I don't want to go into academia
I really want to learn how to weld tho
i've never had a chance
tho i hope i dont get any profs that are only here for research and could care less about teaching
yeah, seems to be a problem everywhere tho
and if what I want is there, I'm chill
but yes, the whole professors that don't like undergrads thing annoys the crap out of me
if someone tells u they like it
they either are lying
I don't care about your advanced black hole research when I'm trying to pass physics two...
it's a bad habit
parts of academia need bashin tbh, dw
im tired
arent u a mod :thonk:
might go clean my gecko's cage, has to be done
its a pdf tho idt alexa can do that
its a pamphlet from the 1700s i dont think itll be on sparknotes
that’s mine tho julia wtf
my memory is fungi i cant remember mine @spacemanboris
Does anyone want my cell phone number?
Neel, what's your social and the last four digits of your credit card
I can’t give up my social security
My mom said I shouldn’t give it to ppl on the internet
Thus im not on the internet
Only elon is on the internet
It’s ok neel you don’t trust us? It’s not like I’ve broken into *that* many bank accounts before

But we can’t
Damn that’s a long one
not hard to dox

Oh gotcha Sarah
Birds aren’t real tho
I couldn't afford a pigeon
we don’t speak of meese here
Sadly it turns out ostrichs can't fly

Its just I can't call you
This is too much work
this is why u need to have simple forms of communication
If I need to call you, I gotta buy gary a long distance bus ticket to wayne

there is a bus stop right by my house so the walk to my house isn’t far
I almost dropped my address jesus fuck
Gary might be able to outrun you Julia

didn’t you buy a mule on roblox?
oh my ||gromit||
I think this is all I need to say
^ they have a staggered start and aren't coming back after thanksgiving just like case
but am i wrong
Isn’t that the rhythm game
Idk about anime girls
it’s like some people move in two weeks early i think
so someone hates ohio here
i dont hate ohio
biting ur tongue sucks
Oof rip
so howdy won’t bite his tongue
You’re wrong one of us needs to evolve a brain. Me
atleast it isnt 9/11, cuz that would put a damper on ur celebrations
omg that would be so tragic
little plane cupcakes
oh noes
don’t mess around with brownies on the line bro
i’m so tired all my brain cells are gone
its only 10pm tho :thonk:
tho my sleep schedule is non existent
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US
rip if i become bald like my dad imma just cry
quarrantine birthdays suck tho, like i was getting food with my friends and apparently there are no more tables for 8 anymore
rip
u could have tried 2 tables of 4
We ended up doing 2 tables of 4, but it was so strange because we were all so spread out
you need the aluminium can with string to communicate
and the ppl at the table next to us were like "don't you guys need masks" and rip my friends ended their lives with the comebacks
Okay sorry but I can't eat with a mask on
do like the people in china do cuz the air is so bad, just raise em and lower them
rip in any case we got the waiter to laugh
i hope that one isnt u
huh, the arrow didnt save
I wish but alas, it's not
wtf is "business owner at business man"
oh god, literally by reflex i almost went into the "why mathnasium speech"
Mathnasium is a math franchise tutoring thing akin to Kumon but less weird
I get paid 11 dollars an hour to verbally abuse and demean children while going on my phone
RIP chuck e cheese pizza hit hard back in the day
I hate Mathnasium. I interviewed for a job there and they asked if I knew an employee there and I did— my friend. Test was easy money and I crushed the interview but never got the job. Turns out this other person got the job instead of me because she knew the freakin owner of the branch
it still doesnt sound real
like math + gymnasium
People on school math teams are called mathletes lmao
some sophmores tried an esports club, but since its school, no shooters or games with violence were allowed

Words can’t describe how stupid my class is
my class wanted to meetup at school
no, that was also told no, but the dum dums didnt listen
My middle school principal told us that we were the worst class our middle school ever had
probably due to the high concentration of rich brats
and stupid idiots
jeez, we only had 2nd worst

My district hosts diversity workshops and they don’t do shit

I’m talking single digits in my school
and there were 2 hispanic kids last  year
I don’t know what’s the breakdown of Columbus
Oh same here
I can’t find the pic rn
Jons Hopkins did a study or something and called it a "drop-out factory"
not that redlining isnt real but these things are sometimes not due to redlining and can just be due to natural causes, such as POC naturally preferring to move into areas with people of their same race cause they feel more comfortable there, especially with mexicans who have a strong shared culture
and obviously its often due to gentrification too
shit lmao
Oof I’m sorry
i have 200 notifications from the groupme wtf guys
Otherwise my phone goes bonkers
i just turned on my phone (it was dead) and now it's having a stroke
Bruh I was in another college groupme. Worst thing ever
Omg
I got added to a USA ‘24 thing and I left IMMEDIATELY
I got added to that without my consent
and the guy was like “pls don’t leave”
and crying
I didn’t even see the point of it
Guys my navigator was supposed to email me my course recs this week
Sorry I meant last week technically
I don’t know if I should email him 👀
did you ask for them to do that? 😳 because mine didn’t do that at all
discord is a better groupme tho
Absolutely horrible
Wtf
so u guys don’t wanna be added to my Earth ‘24 groupme?
tho it would probably crash groupme servers
Groupme is terrible
discord is better tho
I never used discord so much until this year
Also is it bad I planned something that’s 3 months away
I feel guilty whenever I procrastinate a gift
It’s something that’s supposed to be thoughtful so that stressed me out
oh dang
That relate to stuff that really only I and them know (inside jokes)
I want to respect the other ppl’s privacy tho
dont stress tho
I wish bro i dont know why i cant fix my sleep schedule
i went to bed at nine and now im awake
i dont think i go to sleep for the night anymore, i just take periodic naps
I'm worried that if school is synchronous online for stuff this fall, I'll be absolutely screwed when I have to wake up at 6:00am for 9:00am classes
i havent rlly spoken on this server in a hot min LMAOOO
they havent released anything formal, but the prediction is we are goin back, since Corona is getting better in Michigan and because other big public schools are opening as well

My home screen wallpaper is one of the basic iPhone ones
i feel you man, i also hate people who hate ohio
OH
Oh
As a native I will ensure y’all love the state I ‘hate’
ohio is not shit
If you’re in the city/suburbs of Ohio cities, then it’s fine. I hate the countryside though
jk i can’t wait to leave
I can’t wait to leave either. My area is diluted but still a little more conservative and I can’t afford to lose any more brain cells
Need to protect themselves from all the corn surrounding them
I’m so sorry that happened to you
should just end it all cuz of that
and find out
i thought my reddit app was broken
i do feel bad for any actual amish who leave and ddont realize the joke
i cant say i have
It’s in Dublin Ohio and it’s called Field of Corn. I’ve never been there though haha
if covid wasn’t stupid we could have an ohio meetup 😔
but it would be hard to settle on a place
cuz most of us are cleve, cbus, or cinci
I want to go to campus again before school starts
I’ve been there but I wanna know what it’s like since I kinda forgot
well, there were some protests there last week
and the city turned off all the lights so people would assemble there
i wanna go it looks so sick
im not sure if it was still there, but there was a miniforest that we used to hide in
there are also wade oval wednsdays, but last i heard they started to go downhill which is sad
OH!
Oh
cuz the last time i was there, i was standing next to it when i won 5k
stupid government
Damn what contest was that
my bad
Netflix is now boring to me
I don’t know what to do anymore
Everything is boring
Except I played tennis today and had a zoom call with my boss
Honestly that was fun but now I am bored and might work for fun
Franklin plays tho
But I did play tennis during the school year but not at CWRU
Nothing
Anyone want to play game pigeon
My boss told me the plans for cwru
Can’t say until babs announces
Cuz it was her choice to leave
Technically she is getting replaced but only cuz she’s deciding to leave first
There’s some parent things but idk
Sorry people Julia’s taken now
Too bad you have to livestream it because of corona 🤧
oh shit you’re right
well what governor Murphy doesn’t know won’t kill him
And I hate Ohio
But then they took that away
I still have zoom premium
i still have it
The google version of zoom is so bad
sorry i’m having too much fun with him
omg and his lil head can peek out 🥺🥺🥺
is he fun to hug though?
he kinda feels like a small child
and when u pat his tummy it’s like patting my chunky cats tummy
I wanna boop his nose
his nose is very boop-able
I’ll leave
Cuz he gromit
u make a fair point he is adorable
His head be a pear
Yo corona virus tho
He needs a mask
I feel so old
Like I am almost 20 it’s sad
I am 20 in 8 months
That’s no longer a teenager
Damn I can’t believe ohiohater69 didn’t give it away
I did know yesterday but forgot
has the gromit obsession gone too far
i feel it beth
You need a gromit shirt
I don’t want to bombard on that roommate bonding
I can’t believe I haven’t gotten them yet
Julia I am disappointed
You can no longer be my fake little for legal reasons that’s a joke
Because I am a bad influence
I don’t put milk in my cereal
you don’t???
true but milk makes my tummy hurt 😩😩
I don’t think we can have it in the dorm
the mini fridge i got has a freezer sooooo
i can't
oh to see without my eyes
no adam hates gromit 😭😭😭😭
that I need you to see
I haven’t in awhile but I say start college with a bang
Then I outgrew the costume and didn’t get a new one
bad bad bad bad
oh to see without my eyes 🙈✨
Ima head out before the CIA gets here
I work for the cia Ben
Shit!
is this because you work for the fbi?
I work for the NSA
You work for the FBI
I’d be such a bad FBI agent
One of my friends used to work for the NSA
I’d apologize for arresting someone
She doesn’t work for them anymore
That’s what they want u to think
Damn that’s why they can’t attract candidates tho
Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value.
They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves.
To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.
So don’t buy Albert an koala stuffed animal
how the living fuck
sarah how the fuck
No we haven't i swear
Psychic shit
ok but i never said it was my FAV in that encounter
i assumed since u talked about how u did a report on them or smth

Excuse me is someone shit talking Ohio
Oh god oh fuck its @spartan010

sarah it’s been one day, and I already want out
And for some reason the last couple days I’ve gotten a bunch of pegging TikToks lmfao I don’t know why
Don’t google that
and someone said something related to it
Oh that too
I don’t get why everyone is obsessing over those two protesters
You don’t know what they look like
I mean the riot gear looks kinda hot ngl
all we know is that they’re tall and they throw shit 😭😭
It’s not rly serious
Idk why
I just want to be forgotten 😩😩
To never exist
hard to steal his social security number if you don’t know what his name is
Bipedal appa tho
Smh my head
I’m smhing my head so hard rn
Idk if I’ll watch korra tho
i don’t even know how i find new music bc i rarely go thru an artists whole collection but maybe i shoulf when i’m like getting ready or cleaning or smth
I don’t know where I would be without music
Long car rides would last 5 years
Podcasts r for car trips music for everything else
Sometimes I’ll be about to go to sleep but I don’t want to cuz I don’t want to pause my music
Sometimes I look in the mirror and feel bad for people who even look in my direction
fuck i cant even spell
Sometimes I feel bad for ruining pictures
I also feel bad for ruining the view
Holy shit a moth just tried to fly up my nose
going to bed soon tho
Damn identity theft isn’t a joke Albert
I hate ohio
Tired hbu
it was a very generic conversation— “why case?” “what do you want to do?” Etc
Honestly imo navigators don’t do anything
That moment when you have 40 words in your essay because you procrastinated the last 2 weeks
had to get mine done earlier because I'm going out of town next week and then I'm getting my wisdoms pulled
Don’t turn in papers
i dont think ur allowed to retake if youve passed one before
Woah I even forgot abt the sages essay
Which isn’t bad
But idk what exactly to take so
I don’t think so either but I’ll just make a schedule and see what my navigator thinks
I’m also thinking of double majoring and the website said you could add an intro class for another major but I don’t know if I wanna do that yet
i was trying to make mine earlier but for some reason sis wasn’t loading 😔😔
Yeah someone else told me the website was down
& yeah idk when additional majors/minors come into play so ima just hold off on the first semester 💀😂
Guess what National day it is today as well oop
that makes so much sense i didn’t even make that connection
This class choosing this is so confusing?
Or maybe I just need another nap
But also I need to feel Productive today
I have done nothing but gone in and out of sleep and watch YouTube these past 3? days
I graduate on Friday nothing matters ukno
u wont
i won’t hesitate b i t c h
Oh the finger pointer
are u waiting for someone else to finish it or
Even more of a mood
if at first you dont succeed
do you guys think we’ll still have orientation week
I think we will but family won’t be invited
I guess everyone’s asleep 😔
don’t want 🐊  or 🦏
^^ I didn’t know they had recommendations
Like they have dell laptop suggestions and laptops but I just wanted to ask if anyone had anything better
Damn it I use a MacBook
dont do dell
apple is even worse
miss me with overprices aluminium
I just find MacBooks easier to navigate than PCs
so, you dont need a heafty computer, probably something to take notes
I think the argument between macs and windows are arbitrary, both can get shit done
you could easily get away with an i3
🤷‍♂️I’ve had a Windows and Mac in my life and my Mac from 2010 has outlived my pc in terms of speed and reliability
if the mac cant do much from the start
and is anti fix
I’ve used both windows and Mac
The Mac can do much more out of the box than windows can
And Windows has waaaay more problems with it than Mac
I’ve only ever had one problem with my Mac and that was when the hdd died
With my windows, literally I accidentally dropped some water on it and it died
The only problem I had with Mac was that it froze. All I had to do was restart. My mom has a Windows pc and it wiped out all of her data for a good 15 minutes. I don’t even know how she got that data back
I wouldn’t say that, the processors are actually not as good for macs, you pay more for the same processors as a pc, it just feels like it runs faster because of the way Mac is coded ig
Wish that were me
Crazy I haven’t asked this yet that’s so important
I had a Samsung laptop that had a faster processor but it was slow af
How much SSD/hard drive space do you have?
Boot camping is annoying because you have to always restart your Mac
Wine is pretty slow rn tho, one of my friends (coincidentally he is going to Case as a class of 2024 student) tried using it on his Broadwell MacBook Pro
he wanted to get FL Studio running but had to buy Logic
yeah he doesn't want to
My dad has his personal stuff on my current laptop so I may get a new one
I am considering because it’s likely my dad might need the one I have
I’ll probably transfer my stuff onto a hard drive so that way I still have stuff but my dad has extra space
But it could slow it down
that's why I haven't tried dual-booting macOS or Ubuntu, never thought I would get anything out of either given the programs I use and Linux distros on Windows
and no I am not using AirMessage because Buckeye "Broadband" isn't reliable enough and I don't have a spare computer lying around to host the server on
You laugh but that's literally exactly what is sitting in the radiation room of my dad's office at the hospital he works at
it's also missing a key
Oh and that reminded me case apparently has discounts or whatever for Apple so ig if u wanna try that when ur buying @sprinkles2108
I didn’t bother reading much bc I wasn’t buying Apple but yea
Don’t worry when I got one freshman year of high school they honored it even though I told them I was in high school
Idk much abt laptops to have brand loyalty
I don’t know how
It only happens occasionally though
i get people want slimmer and slimmer
Oh my
See that I don’t fuck with
Yeah I’d rather have my laptop a bit thicker so that I know what’s going on
rip I just screenshotted a macbook pro
bad
ok so Air shouldn't be much of a departure
I hate the air
It sucks
like the one that just came out a few months ago?
well, if you want some new air, open up some windows
Do they make any notable laptops anymore besides the x360?
those aren't repairable
The air is more janky from my experience
Maybe it’s just her laptop
Unfortunately I don’t 😂
they also get rid of that stupid butterfly keyboard across the entire lineup
Especially for Apple products so I need Xcode
you might want to get at least a higher-specced Pro 13
I’ve ran Xcode for 4 years on my current one
I am sorry that you are forced to use Xcode
I’m gonna probably stick to 13 since I don’t want to carry so much weight around
i gagged what would you ever need that for
like at that point just get a Mac Pro or build a PC
who needs 8 tB??
probably people shooting many hours of RED RAW
I don’t even take notes like that my laptop is 99% for personal use and entertainment
Man I hate that
It took me forever for me to upgrade my phone bc I hated that they took away the earbud jack
except no USB-C is a deal breaker for me personally so if you are crazy enough to live with microUSB go for it
still dont know why people just rolled over
I just stuck with an iPhone 6 until this year
like i hope to never upgrade my phone for years, it has usb c and 3.5mm
now I need 2 headphones bc I refuse to buy EarPods
ron, with headphones, it once again goes to price, type, and looks
I'm going to have to upgrade next year because I'll stop receiving security updates next August and Samsung doesn't allow you to unlock the bootloader in the US even on carrier-unlocked models so no LineageOS for me
Yea get another tech thing idk shit abt
cuz earbuds are smaller and more practical, but sound quality suffers
i'll poke about, i've used earbuds on my phone cuz all i do is watch youtube tbh
very shoddy manufacturing tho
Yea I prefer wires for my phone but Bluetooth for laptops
I never really invested in headphones so I go through them so quick
my brother is the same, he gets the $10 headphones every 5-6months. they work for what he needs em for i guess
It does, but if I can find a pair that actually lasts a year+ I don’t mind dropping more money at once
nothing worse than the feeling of have to sneeze
and then it doesnt sneeze
I'm trying to put more work into the essay
i just lose it
okay i hate to bring up the mac vs pc argument, but the only thing i hate about mac's rn is the touchbar. it's annoying
How is it annoying
Does it just not work sometimes
Oh ew
i miss that tbh
After that idk wtf happened
harder to fix
I mean yeah when they came out with the iPhone 6
I need to download my pics on an SD card lol
I never had it but my friends did and man 3D just hits different
and then they went to the 2ds
I just want the original wii back
My Xbox is dead to me
Do they even sell Wii anymore
Aw
That’s actually sad
tho look at this site
The copyright 2010 makes me feel old
looks like amazon is still an option
Oh snap
didnt they have a pink one
That was the shit
Wii sports and resort though
Imagine getting to the end of your sages assignment
work backwards, its how u do it
oh howdy you completely tore apart her argument
Damn that’s Literate
Is there any reason why anyone would want integrated?
if the ra doesnt catch me
Shit guess who forgot to take their allergy meds
rip
what happened when yall met with navigators
if you dont know much about the area
My navigator just tried to get to know me better than what my application offered
The only time after freshman year you need your navigator is if you’re sick af and want to be excused from class
Howdy is sick, please give him an A++++++
Ok but which doctor, on a college campus there's probably like a 50% chance that any faculty you run into has a doctorate
I mean we will be near a ton of hospitals too
tru, but  i dont need any hospital bills
dang it, foiling our plans
Rip ppl living on magnolia rn
the one near wade oval?
isnt that museums and home restoration projects?
cuz tight circles would get u dizy fast
Idk he is creepily looking at kids
Ew wtf
Idk I had a tennis racquet so I was prepared
Idk what was going on but then a parent came over before I could really react and the guy went away
bonk him over the head with the racket
I’m dead😂
so i cant filter them all
This happened throughout the school year
i wish it wouldnt
notifications suck
Except when there was shots fired
And then some ppl left
cant say i've been tbh
But they sold us lemonade but were out
that doesnt seem possible
you cant exactly make that non acoholic
It’s really a bad photo
Honestly tastes bad
well, beer already tastes bad
I hate beer
Idk I liked to prank my friend who was an ra with it
But she was never there when I brought it back
rip
Still am but
better weird than boring
I didn’t actually know about the keg until afterwards
Still kinda pissed about that
Because I should know about that but didn’t
wanted to snag somebefore it got drank
cuz isnt it usually 2-3 a room
But the thing was my dorm was really exclusive and most ppl didn’t associate with others outside
oh man
was there 2 people from opposites sides who fell in love secretly
rip
Most because they go to too hard
Like still CWRU kids
did you guys get the email about the schedule? cuz i didn’t but apparently people in the group me did
oh i see i thought maybe things got messed up and i wasn’t on the mailing list or sum
that would be bad
I just got mine a few minutes ago
oh
final exams being held remotely is going to be odd
yeah :// maybe they’ll make them open note tho that’d be lit
I mean I never had issues
But I felt bad for others
the unable to submit cuz erro
Yeah and the submit button not working
you dont be big brain
i just didnt have a final exam
Idek why I took some of the exams this year
It is nothing new tbh. Just says we have on campus school
i don’t think they’ll put freshmen in hotel rooms
Oh to space out more?
Idk
i think they’re doing this stuff so we won’t have roommates
Rip to upperclassmen housing
bruh id cry
I want you to live with her
seriously 😔 being in a single would be like ok but it’d probably be so lonely
You need to live close to her then
we won’t tell them we have a 3rd roommate
What they don’t know won’t kill them
that’s a fair deal
Also can they stop you from sleeping in another room
i hope they just make us quarantine for two weeks and the hotels are so half of us can stay there for two weeks or something
Unless they find out
honestly i feel like housing half of the student body in hotels would take a huge amount of money
I mean the dorms r shit
i wish bro
I feel like Clarke would be the biggest issue when it comes to social distancing—isn’t it the largest dorm?
its college
You can always siphon money away from the school
Idk about that one chief
Why don’t we all just quarantine in a hospital
Nope sorry it’s the rules, that’s what I read online so it must be true
So we don’t even have to leave if we get sick
i've been trapped inside this cage for ages
ugh, I love gromit
I would rather live in Clarke than at home
tru, they would need anti espionage protection
and i dont think dorm insurance covers that
I used to have so many webkinz 😭
never got it online
Wtf is a webkinz
You don’t know
I once tried to name one “goddamnit”
“Damn my computer has webkinz I gotta see tech support”
the site still exists
Even tho I am Jewish
I wish I could remember my username and password
You can still play
Without a webkinz
wasnt there also the hamster pets
those lowkey scared me
those bitches ALWAYS got stuck in my hair
All I got for my childhood were math problems
rip
I should’ve gone bald then, then I could’ve kept the trend going
Looks the same in the end
What happened with moo and the raisins? 😳
they were supposed to be like a treat for him but my mom gave him a bunch everyday bc he loved them and i think he stopped eating his real food and depended solely on raisins
poor moo 😭😭😭
albert are u still mocking zhu zhu pets
I can’t believe I sent that
It really looks like guns
Idk

Why am I the only one who doesn’t get it

Omg the vasta nerada
Sadly my doctor who knowledge only goes so far
It’s part of the reason I have such a bad fear of the dark
you shouldnt be afraid of the dark
her ending was so sad
Yea she’s one of the few older companions so you didn’t have to deal w weird romance
Yo howdy when we were talking abt dw last time I forgot abt Martha

i dont like her
Like they just took her plot too far
i wish i could rewatch but it’s only on like UK netflix 😔
She didn’t have to be that op
its on uk netflix?!
Pirate life tho
Honestly I should just pirate but that feels like so much work
I used to do it for anime bc it’s easy now but I don’t even watch much anymore
i havent watched that idk how to get access
the writing sucks
i feel bad they had potential
We gotta find some illegal sites
They were sorta on a downturn with Capaldi bc ppl didn’t want an older doctor but the newest one kinda tanked it even more
I really liked capaldi tho
evan omg
im not on discord much idk how that works
My intro was lame it was basically: "Hi! I like philosophy here's my insta and snap"
I didn’t even realize you said that already 💀
I’m pp head
Franco you can’t leave me hanging like this
but idk how to do the bots
Discord is annoying if u don’t use it on a regular basis

> Franco you can’t leave me hanging like this
@mootdoot SORRY i didnt read it
Econ is close enough
someone said they were philosophy
Omg
Really?
evan watch that someone be yourself

Imma be in a class by myself
I forgot ice hockey is a thing
Whether that's a good or bad thing
I want to major in philosophy and evolutionary biology cuz I'm "quirky"
RON OMG
I'll have to check it out recently i've been studying the origins of morality in relations to evolutionary biology so I haven't had time to look at nihilist or existentialist texts
that actually sounds so sick evan
I used to have her school supplies and Christmas themed decorations
Oh sickkkk
I want to get back into my cringe child years
Aren't all memes people and words lmaoooo

I played one campaign every two weeks for 4 months that’s all I got
Yo I’ve always wanted to play magic
I bought a set of cards to start and never did idk where it is now

I used to know how to actually play the two games but I lost those important life skills
if you dont know what ur doing
I need help
I just don’t remember the rules
Do stocks actually work?
he's legit a millionaire tho
True to my nickname all funds will be used on my tech wants
Franco just told me that he wants to invest all his money into Inner City Youth
Omg my Stonks
but i dont have moni
i totally would tho
No one should have money in college or ur not doing it right
But I cannot maintain my current technolust levels without a soul
He signed a contract already and everything
voting in WA in november is utterly useless with the electoral college
All general elections r useless bc of electoral college
Bc my vote literally doesn’t matter cuz we’re gonna be blue no matter what
Go to school in Florida
do they make it hard to register in ohio?
Yea having a big city really skews things more left
Cleveland is relatively blue isn’t it
The idea of everyone moving and spreading out is in theory but a terrible practice
Yea I mean even though Illinois is almost certainly blue once you leave Chicago locally it can get way less liberal
Isn’t that most places
This is why my parents want me to live on the coasts
It’s either that or the south and I think my body isn’t built for that type of heat regardless of ethnicity
Ehh snow is cold tho
I dun like cold
I rly went from Seattle to Cleveland
Wow I really hate myself don’t I
stop saying cle is worse than sea
Both cold rainy/snowy
I meant I should have gone to like la or someplace warm
I got nothing against Ohio
Can’t get good bbq tho that’s a deal breaker
Oh yeeeeea
I haven’t rly had authentic deep dish but ny pizza slaps
I don’t think I’ve had real ny
Gosh I suffered with Hawaiian for the first 12 years of my life I cannot like it anymore
WTF
I’m sorry but we can no longer communicate
I just cannot like Hawaiian due to 12 straight years of it
Ok fair
The school?

I went there
Oh noice
u cant tell me im wrong
i want some deep dish tho
What the fuck happened
crackhead hours 😔
I guess I’m not a crackhead ☹️
Did someone kick me from crackhead?
I mean you don’t have any roles so maybe?
It’s not very active but idk why I got kicked lol
Oh yeah wtf someone added me to that
I said hell no and left 😂
Oh same
I was like nope, bye !
Idk who added me
Lmao I just realized I have no roles
No pls don’t do that 😅
Shit
Oh
Ok it’s gone now
Lmaoooo I’m not bold enough to give out my Spotify either
There’s a reason I made a 20 hour long death metal playlist and named it lofi beats to study and sleep to
I’m sure I’m missing some
I just didn’t know what it was called for some reason
I thought it playing through my phone speakers
I get so scared of that too
Oh
Fat fingers I guess lol
Or too small phone
I have an iPhone XR
That’s why I didn’t get a XS or XS max
Oh yeahh
I wish we could make them bigger
I don’t know if it changed my keyboard size though
I never understood, but somehow all my female friends who are very petite always have the biggest phones 😂. They always complain about how they can’t hold their phone properly
Yet they still buy the biggest models of phones 😂
I wanted a bigger phone than the 6s
And the XS wasn’t much bigger than the 6s
Yeah and it didn’t have any new features
She doesn’t really
Yeah that’s true, idk how it has a bigger battery tho
Oh
iPhone > android
I feel like High school was honestly completely useless
I’ve been in school for 15 years if you count preschool
I wlda learned more sitting at home fucking around everday
I wish I went somewhere else
They were awful people
Speaking of the vc last night heehee
I don’t know what incels are
Nah nvm I’m referencing last nights vc
Oh
I wasn’t on the vc last night

You mean it wasn't pulled out of Franco's butt?
Oh I think it’s basically some guy who looks like shit and can’t get girls so he becomes a misogynistic domestic terrorist or something
Hahahaha wtf I love it
English has become so much more expressive since 2000
Idk you can look it up
... h.u I need to pull out a dictionary
Sigh
Must be hard

Last day of in person classes is 11/20
Natural selection will work its thing
corona isn't cancelled, it's just overstated in ohio especially
if you claim it doesnt exist
i don't
never said that
we need to check u into the mental hospital
Under 20 deaths in ohio? 0. Hospitalizations since onset from Cuyahoga County? ~20.
*we will need that hospital faster*
I have an article too if anyone wants proof
we need a facepalm emote for everytime this happens
that will work
Yes corona isn’t bad
i just don't think you should shame them for wanting to socialize...
Okay and i wish poverty was 0% and child hunger was 0%
you can't have absolutes in life
there are still ppl getting ebola for gods sake
you can't eliminate a fucking disease
dont u deal in absolutes :thonk:
still a sith
Ebolas alr known tho?
Babies get what they need despite not knowing language
i wish u could resize emotes
Ig for readability but it’s lowkey annoying
oh shit i thought i did something
i thought by adding a space, it would work
Yea I don’t like supersizes emoji only messages
@stuckinohiolads want to date a furry

i like to be treated like complete and utter shit
it's what every woman wants
i thought we went over this
cuz no girls at school for him
don't even think about continuing that
Oh my
GOD DAMN
oh no
rip
i dont even know what music crackheads listen too, but im not eager to find out
probs anything with base is my guess
But when u trick out your car for it I’m a little less inclined to like it
what, you dont like when the car and the 5ft circle around it is litterly shaking up and down
found this on minecraft skindex... rip
Meg is p scary in person
huh, i never thought how difficult ears would be
im dead
Oh hell yea
I haven’t heard the slide in forever what a vibe that is
Cupid shuffle though
I wonder how awful life must have been before they released
Roman we’re twins except I’m at 15
it still looks terribble
fuck science bro
Dark mode hurts my eyes actually and gives me awful headachex
and when it’s late but u can’t stop messaging on discord
But then as someone who wears glasses I get more of a headache wearing them and looking at light objects
all those problems will go away
If u want productivity help that much just get those blue/white light lamps n call it a day
No need to stare at it 24/7
Well I never read the Bible so
doesnt mean i should believe it
my teacher straight up roasted every religion except rasta

"cold"

i am the guy with the cold disease
when they can't even take care of themselves?
this man hasn't even started college, and has already burnt out
I like how we’re STILL attacking him for that
fuck
Y’all need to chill
Damn lucky
Go suck a fat one
I use intellij light mode cuz I can’t see the contrast colors in dark mode
I hope you choke on a fat juicy dick bro
Jgrasp is the worst insult in mankind
But that’s the worst
And it’s funny I couldn’t find any credible article or scientific paper saying that light mode kills ur eyes
Ok fine you couldn’t find an article
But it hurts
It doesn’t hurt me
In fact dark mode hurts me
IT RADIATES MORE BLUE WAVES WHICH IS BAD FOR YOU
How on earth does dark mode hurt
neel, if it hurts
back me up tho, he needs dark background on white text
It HURTS
That’s bull shit
*and they usally arent very good :(*
Howdy don’t do that rn
but in the day i need bright white
also it's such a pointless and petty issue that no one gives a fuck
Not on phones though
everyone clearly gives a fuck, neel
and if you go to the living computer museum in SEA, just about every vintage computer is dark mode
post link or it didnt happen
THIS RESEARCH WTF
you can't just say pseudoscientist when you don't agree with the point
Oh boi
im still surprised neel can even see what we are typing given that this is him rn
sorry for bullying u neel but that’s hilarious
my dad said that "i've been using 'light mode' since the first modern pc came out and my eyes are just fine"
u dont even have to switch
and idk he's an opthamologist
rip
Dark mode tho
he's a fucking eye doctor
coconut = worst nut
worst nut = ur dads nut into ur mom
oh to see without my eyes
The tweet doesn’t lie
did i miss something
Omg I’m edgy??
now u need those big braclets
and have dyed hair covering 1 eye
I want silly bandz
i  guess so
THAT WAS THE SHIT
i still have some i think
u need black vans
I don’t know where mine are
some eye shadow
talk about how life is pain
we need full edge
dunno
isnt anime just high pitched screaming and neck beards
that doesnt seem very edgy
Dang I hate it when the neckbeards take the fun outta things
Can’t enjoy any one of the spider-men/beings without running into them
what happened with spiderman?
Don’t get me started
couldnt be me
Of someone saying that they hated miles bc it contradicts the message of “anyone can wear the mask”
I wish I had no apps
Are you texting us on a laptop howdy
that sucks ron
The issue with Spider-Man fans is that they hate diversity despite using it as a front as to why he’s one of the best
Yea if they make a Spider-Man skin for the ps5 my money will be even more gone
like most fandoms, u have a vocal group that doesnt like anything
Everyone’s so worried abt what happened to peter like who cares it’s not abt him lol
Lol I forgot the ending of the first game
Mans looks so old tho lol
which to be fair
the super hero movies were the worst, and comics were for losers
Idk how anime got so popular these past 5 years
i'd still classify is as more out there
too much internet makes howdy a dull boy
Actually anime rap just becoming a thing is weird bc nicki Minaj has been using Japanese and Chinese themes in her rap since forever
Someone who unironically uses techolust
i still dont believe that was written
completely seriously
I have yet to even look at that essay question since I first did weeks ago
everytime i get to "daddy, please stop googling" i lose it
its how schools work
They’re trying to take us out before we even get in
They missed the timing of school to prison pipeline and they’re trying smth new
Case will try to take me out bc I didn’t submit it on time little do they know the raven will arrive next year
you need the fancy the
cuz it looks like handwriting
but they didnt care
so i usually just stuck with that
Yea either that or I download as a pdf
hmm, i think ur supposed to do this to prevent dry skin
never happened before
Yoooo it took me forever to find a chapstick that worked for me
that you shouldnt always put it on
cuz then ur body wont deal with it
The body sucks like that, so lazy
and chapstick should be saved for really cold tems
I will keep buying bath and body works and complain everytime they don’t help
Ok I never took German so
I dislike languages with so many consonants, like why so serious
Really? My friends from school told me that German is hard
idk for me i think english is easy
spanish is hard that's why i stopped asap lmao
I did Chinese for 4 years but I’m so bad at it bc I can’t get the sentence structures down
Dang my school didn’t offer Chinese
idk but german is a prettier language
oh no
Big sad
i can say "fuck you" in diff ways to mean diff things
god that caused my phone to flip out
And I literally just got this phone like 😭
I can’t even imagine what the whole us is like
and it’s horrible
I just don’t know what we would talk about yk?
it's an election year and it's the entire country; there's someone with a differing opinion
I just reread that stupid sages article to attempt to write at least a sentence and I am brimming w so much Anger
I lost brain cells while reading it and had to read it again because it was disorganized
especially since for the past 3-4 months
think about it, without cell phones, you'd never be here
> I just reread that stupid sages article to attempt to write at least a sentence and I am brimming w so much Anger
@mootdoot  what sages article
We need cell phones
Still it was hard to write
well, it was supposed to be a response to her
I ended up not even applying to GT lol
I couldn’t comprehend it 1. Because I haven’t read anything academic in a while and 2. It sucks
Mostly cuz it sucks haha
It was hard to formulate a response
I have so many dissents bouncing around in my head I can’t just pick one
and she clearly didnt try at all
couldnt be me
I know don’t writing
I want ice kweem🥺
I haven’t had Mitchell’s lol
Guess I’m in for a surprise
Isn’t it a franchise?
even neel cant say its bad
its a hard knock life
You know, those unspecified math problem units
I didn’t even finish the show I was watching smh
rip
you always get so hungry at 5am
much too late
Lol after she got married to nick i fell off her
The age gap I CANT
I never watched quantico
thats how all good shows die
execs wanting more money
Isn’t driving over 10 the actual speeding definition
but no one really cares till its 10 over
Rip
they want as much money as possible
Pennsylvania sucks more imo
Pennsylvania doesn’t suck
Ohio and Maryland suck the most
Oh I haven’t been to Maryland in awhile
I heard that texan drivers are the absolute worst tho. Is the stereotype true?
Maryland sucks
Oh
I don’t remember Cali drivers so
damn yall really just leaving out connecticut like this huh
Ohio drivers are SLOW AF
its cuz of the police
Driving in Sanfran was the worst both bc their roads are terrifying but people also don’t care
no one wants a ticket
Oh snap Connecticut
Police want stonks
I don’t even know what to say of it
Nothing
*atleast we arent gary*
Indiana do suck tho but those gas prices 👀
Damn Neel
I don’t what
But who doesn’t like robot strippers?
I don’t like u
But like I still love nier automata the most tho
Nah just on bias alone Spider-Man
But like nier automata tho
I wish I could play those games on pc tho
I'm a pc masterrace
I’m a die hard Xbox fan but some ps titles are a run for their money
true, we need monies
The main reason I want a ps is for the titles
Need for speed??
need for speed is not xbone only
Y'all be ignoring the switch tho
My mom just wanted it to play fruit ninja on kinect
Need for speed rivals is only an Xbox title tho
Switch is vibes tho
I do want a switch tho
switch is that cross of a phone gaming
arent we 12h apart
Or I could just play doom eternal on my laptop
The master chief collection for pc was good tho
I got a gaming laptop instead of a pc specifically to play doom eternal on my plane ride to cleveland
But why do then when u can buy pc?
Because I hate PCs, they always break on me
Bad luck man
cuz i have yet to break a computer
Not really, most of my fam agrees. Also it didn’t break
The hard drice just quit
i have a 7yr old laptop witha spinning disk still chillin
well, when it cant do anything to start with, no wonder it still chillin
I think the only game it hates for some reason is the new far cry
Like when I tried playing far cry 4, it hated me
Ah shit I gotta sleep now
damn
It’s my only computer tho, I gave my sister my old Mac
And my pc is just lying in a dusty closet somewhere, I haven’t used it in years
it seems both asus and msi
as someone who does repairs on both
they both suck
I’ve never had to repair my Mac other than clean the fan
general pc maintence
Uh howdy you’d hate my house then. My dad still sometimes uses his laptop from 1998 that has some janky ass gpu and PowerPC cpu for medical stuff
My dad uses a computer from 2008 sometimes
So like I know how to take care of laptops. It’s up to the company to make a durable laptop that isn’t a piece of shit
Not rlly tho
tho might get bogged down by the internet
God I hate that
oh, an micro display port
couldnt be me
no, its cuz apple wants to charge for adapters
Like if you can’t charge your phone in a way that isn’t wireless or usb why change that before you change the charger
Usb c isn’t very common though
Nah it is but ur sucks esp for companies that do phones too
Ugh my phone charger is normal usb
I just don’t get it like if you can’t give me a usb c cord for charging don’t change your computers
Z is just, Nothing
than we can throgh the early usb cables
Howdy helped me narrow down computer options
ron speaking mad facts out here
If you need to
But doesn’t it slow it down
Why do that when I can get a laptop
Yes, it’s so clean and efficient
Nah my Apple loyalty doesn’t run that deep to get into anything outside of phones
I run windows on my Mac and it’s still faster than some windows laptops
I hate windows
Slow af
If I gotta spend nearly 1k on a phone I’m not buying anything else
A lot of things are still based in windows tho to my knowledge
more software, more choice, also the ui needs an overall
Apple products can run windows shit tho
🌈🧚✨you opened windows! Now close them 🌈🧚✨
But why do that, when I don’t want the Apple software to begin with
I’m dying at my own fairy comment
I don’t need both so buying a Mac to run windows isn’t necessary
I’m just saying if you need windows mac has a solution
no need more mac
Windows any number sucks
Case closed
neel why tf are you trying to fight everyone today. just let people vibe ffs
Someone mocked me using a Mac
Yes but I don’t really have enough issues with windows to switch
I need to fight back
its manhunt hours
The only thing that sucks about macOS is that it can’t run SolidWorks
I only like Apple phone because they’re simple
its for people who want to pay more
Yea I don’t mind spending more on a simple phone but not computer
Howdy I need to enlighten you in the fall
the ones with the worst issus
Yea still having redownloaded it so if someone wants to fill in any fun news from there...
tho skype is dead
been dead
I thought zoom was bad
Rip
Our district said zoom was bad n unregulated so we could only use that since we had to login with our district emails
fair enough
Considering the fun things I’ve seen happen with schools using zoom I’m not upset that I had to use google meet
Oh wasn’t that in the groupme or something
Like a few weeks ago
i was gonna do that but i got scared bc it started asking like “what did u like best about the on campus life?” and stuff like for ppl that actually went
OH i didn’t even notice that u right
or just answer what you wanted to answer
But why do the work of a company if im not getting paid
this is a sad day
that really should be the description of #quotes cuz it accurate is it not
I got on the authentic tiny taco train and never looked back

IN THE LAST 3 GAMES
and I was so sad for 3 days
I've never been so sad in my life
That shit was sad
but I've never felt *pure sadness*
never heard of it
I'm turned off already <_<
I can assure at least up to like ep 7 of the 2nd season there are no terribly sad moments
sad moments are what make tv shows good tho
Arima: "Maybe my symptoms are an emergent example of my unsolved childhood problems."
Kaori: "REEEEEEEEE DONT LOOK UP MY SKIRT" *stabs Arima*
Your lie got me emotional but I felt like they didn't focus enuf on music
but still I cried
over some stupid anime
I mean that anime didn't focus too much on music rather than the drama part
Damn bro
oh & rn I'm... so obsessed with Liebesleid
I've probably listened to at least 120 hours of Liebesleid at this point (I'm including my piano practice <_<)
Can't believe I didn't appreciate symphonies that mucj before
Though they aren't that bad to listen to either if I do say so myself
compared to korea its gonna be slow
ethernet  isnt wifi tho
you cant ban me
i won’t hesitate bitch

@Deleted User anyone in a competitive eSports team, anyone with a computer gaming minor, and the eSports exec. Since I don’t have perms, for the past 2 years I’ve been knocking on the door and let in. That’s how ppl typically get in
Some schools have it yeah. I don’t know if case does but my high school has one
computer gaming minor?
*sigh, it looks like the rich have won once again*
Is that for your school?
si, the rich famlies were throwing fits that the school wasnt having an imperson graduation
and for their credit, the school was able to withstand for a bit
but i guess too many of them said they might remove their funding
I mean yet they’ve been doing it for the past 100+ years
We tried so hard for an in-person graduation but the county health officials wouldn’t budge. So we had a walk and then a dumb virtual ceremony
My virtual ceremony lasted about an hour though
oh we have a "smoking cigar" moment where the school gives us cigars with the school logo on it among other traditions specific to my school that happen during our graduation/commencement
Aw man I was gna send that
i want to snack on something
but i have nothing to snack on
Rip
They had an extensive smoothie menu tho compared to the other things
It’s like real mint leaves tho so I’m not that upset
If it was mint extract I would’ve been the Big Sad
rip
We both deserve it tho
tbh, i didnt believe it
but it’s just as bad
costco’s don’t exist in these parts
no there isn’t adam 😔
im not sure where bj's fits in tho
Omg there’s aldis in the uk??
tho switch in n out with 5 guys
it was pretty short tho, that probs hurt the ranking
we need a fashion expert
Tic tacs and jelly beans at D is sad to see
tic tacs are not rlly candy tho
Lucky charms doesn’t deserve
When 90% of it is sad unflavored cereal bits
why am i awake
I often found myself sleeping at 3 am and waking up at 7am for school
now it's kind of stuck that way
But my eyes hurt with a mostly-white screen. White radiates more blue waves
Can you do that on iPhone too
Doesn’t night mode reduce blue light?
Idk about iphone but it should have such an option
Light mode doesn’t mess up ur circadian rhythm
Don't light from phone screens inhibit melatonin release
That’s a weak mindset, when has light ever stopped people
Guess I’m weak
Sorry to hear that
I usually stop using my phone 30 mins to an hour before I sleep and I use that time to shower n stuff
Like I’ll already set my phone up playing my podcast and leave it
I stop using my phone when I’m tired
Think that goes for a lot of ppl tho
@Deleted User there are a few bands, but it think its just friends and not an actual club, could be wrong tho
couldnt be me
Sleep is boring
always happen when u have something u need to do but u cba
My body’s just given up and that’s fair so have I
if i do sleep its like from 6-11, which is v bad for me
Oh same about the school part
i tried everything to not get an 8am class, but aparently, thats not happening 4 me
big sad
cuz its tbd for me
i wish we could see that before hand
8 AMs don’t seem too bad tbh
God if I have to do a sages on Thursday I’ll cry real tears
cuz if there is a class that i really like
8am too early
See for me I can’t learn squat past 3 o clock
Man the school system got to u bad
I adapted to the school system and I guess a 9-5 mentality cuz of my ccf internship
Rip
I went to sleep at 2am today but that’s bc I napped my 6-8pm
Major thonking hours
I think I got a majority of my work done from like 9pm-1am
I suck but I like it
tho warning

we need it l o n g
some communities have bad nets and paddles though @sprinkles2108

As a tennis player I’ve NEVER heard of long tennis

See I’m not wrong
Never heard of that before tho that’s wild
I still play tennis 😃

It’s 3rd and 4th years that can actually get apartments isn’t it
I have nothing to do for a whole year might as well go to school however that looks
Cause I don’t wanna do my first sem sitting at home
Well you’re on campus unless you can’t for visa or health reasons
We just go home earlier to finish the semester
I mean if you wanna defer then yea but there’s no guarantees everything returns 21
Plus COVID situation is really bad
if only US had epidemic experience then things wouldn't be so bad
So probably I’ll be able to attend in spring
Even if it does get better idk if they’ll lift all restrictions internationally
lol, fair enough
The feels bro
big rip
I don’t know though
it won’t be for freshmen tho
Goes to show that test scores actually don’t mean shit
I mean I got into college with a shit sat score so
Scores don't really matter
I mean if scores don’t matter bc they pay more attn to essays n stuff just delete them no needs to make students nervous
Honestly fuck college board
ABOLISH COLLEGE BOARD
But they make bank still so
and their services still suck
They couldn’t hire good programmers for AP testing
i feel like nonprofit is pretty clear but not-for-profit suggests profit can be made though it's not the *focus*
Fucking made me take the ap test at 3am
Fuck em
I felt so bad for internationals
I also stayed awake till 5am to take my last ap test
it's not as bad as the students that have to be up at those times for class @Deleted User
Feels sad for them

I don’t listen to much rap though
I hate jazz
I’ve never listened to kpop

Why do we suck
It’s maddening how good that shit is
I’ve never had kimchi

I've never tried those beyond meat burger before
i dont know tho
Almost every fast food places has it except for mcds I think
aren't the fake meats unhealthier than actual meat
I don’t think so
everything is unhealthy in the long term
they say it wont do you in
Yeah soy releases estrogen or something I can’t remember
Have you all tried cocunut water before tho
Lol that’s not bad for dudes
No I think like the estrogen causes men to lose hair and develop breasts
also isnt that what they pump u full of
Someone look it up before hell breaks loose
I don’t want breasts so I’ll pass with the soy
Oh
Gosh imagine being Simpo who’s scared to eat soy bc he thinks he’ll grow boobs overnight
i need hair
Idk I’m hairy to begin with
I want more muscles
Objective for summer: burn fat get abs
Muscles are irrelevant I just want strength
Girls wanna lose weight
I want hair
Nah fuck losing weight
How would that work
too late neel
Shit
Sorry sir
Math puzzles
math? couldnt be me
It gets you to stop worrying about that ever encroaching student debt that you'll never be able to pay off
Use math to stop worrying about math
i used the math to destroy the math
Cuz you teach math now

Phase 4 do be a lil confusing tho
I have watched every single marvel movie in the theaters up to end game except for captain marvel

Recipes i'm saving for college
its the "social safety net" that doesnt work
Maybe I should work at a soup kitchen for community service during college
Soup kitchen is a horrible name
I just think they need to pay more
As much as I see the importance and necessity of taxation. It still fucking sucks tho.
But a fair amount are paying taxes
I think it needs to be skewed more right
thats taxation without representation
My dad paying 55% in tax rate. The actual amount he loses in taxes is probably higher than that tho
Damn
uncle sam wants ur money
it keeps the poor poor
Kids don’t work in India
Oh nah u can legally work at 16 I think
Death
Taxes and death
Just death
Tbh tho I can't blame the rich for not wanting to oay taxes
Just constantly rip
No one wants to pay taxes in general
Nah we don’t
Why can’t paper money go brr for me like it do for airline companies
Okay but like how much is too much? If the income tax rate becomes too high the rich are going to take their money and leave the country. So whichever dem said 50% or higher is like nuts
Then leave rip
Offshore assets n shit
and it still applies
New gen doesn’t always mean change
I hate that guy

I don’t trust his stuff
So far his shlps have been doing pretty well tho

Rip to nasa for having to take his help bc they don’t got much funding
its big sad
Everyone has $0 except military and what are they doing successfully anyway
get next to nothing
imagine space jets tho
we need a plan
and i couldnt imagine an america without hte interstate
I want interstate trains that go zooom
We could however use some roads without potholes
Nah then that’s no longer America
Can’t have America without potholes
Well atleast your road culture isn't as lawless as korea's
While driving on the road today I think i've seen atleast 50 different traffic violations in the span of 15 minutes
i mean it can't be as bad as some other countries
And it's apparently worse in busan
Imma miss ultra fast korean internet speed
Fucking comcast and at&t
Sigh
i never fully experienced ultra fast korean internet sadly
But I can’t conceptualize fast internet
Like it doesn’t seem possible to me
See I just can’t imagine that, that’s utopia
Are just so damn convenient
Imma miss you korean subways
Always clean, with wifi, and ac
I mean it's not all sunshine and rainbows here tho
Ah fuck
I just realized
The worst part about moving...
Fuck
Apparently case has student insurance
Insurance and healthcare tho
Goodbye cheap korean medical costs

Oh hell yea
I had a chinese friend who heard some korean curses he was like "oh shit that sounds aggressive lmao teach me"
bye
"I was heading to a land of oppertunity, a land of promise and hope, but i ended up in america"
The thing is tho, for a lot of places it is
My dad came here broke asf and so did my mom

I had 2 kindergarten graduations which is lit tho
Bc late bday
Unless a sugar father would want me
I give the services of doing Nothing for the low low price of 2k
if you want a child for strickly doing nothing purposes
i am the king of doing nothing productive
Oh
What would they do without those precious chompers
I feel like u missed my joke but that makes it more enjoyable
Cuz when I’m stressed out I grind my teeth in my sleep
We don’t need them to b that sharp anymore
i think mine 2 still p sharp

idk what flat canine means
> idk what flat canine means
@akumaenjeru  I just looked it up haha
isnt it weird how ur house grows and shrinks with the weather
Really?
ye, like doors open and close easier in the summer
cuz the door frame is slightly larger
Isn’t contraction in the cold the reason why things go creak in the night?
Hope is believing in things that probably won’t happen
For all we know 2020 is so jacked up it won’t be a surprise if a meteor hit us
Meteors are constantly trying to destroy us
We’re more likely to die of nuclear warfare
i want to live long enough to establish contact with alien civilizations
See now I would like to die before then so just give me a heads up when they’re on their way
Lol I forgot that exists
oh
I don’t have time for that
dis is some big rain
*heavy rain*
I don't get it
it's raining heavily rn in cleveland
Swift isn’t bad
nope and now neel doesn’t speak because he’s scared
Swift isn't being treated differently
i've never heard of ruby
i'm trying to make a website crawler that can extract certain data from the source of html/js/css thingies.
but i don't want to use either
ye the rain succed
i forgot there were clothes outside
okay well ruby won’t help
the only problem is that js doesn't have parallel computing and neither does java do it without extra code
ugh i hate coding
I hate coding too
i'm coding bc im bored
why trying to pull data thou
'i hate coding' but doing it bc im bored
i mean i've already done data pulling.... jquery isn't hard to figure out.... so i'm past "basic"
im bored
do you want praise or something
NO I JUST DONT WANT TO USE THE LIBRARY
and i want a lighter altenrative
u already use light mode what more do u want
i dont want to use it
idk what u are expecting
like if you just want the data then don’t change it
I want the data, but i want to traverse it. & i also want parallel processing which isnt supported in js nicely
i don't want to though
that's why i need tons of power
wtf can you do with that
i’m assuming you are either doing shady shit or you are just talking shit
I'm bored
what words are you scared of
as i said, i'm bored
first amendment? i don't know him
TBH i've never purchased a plane ticket so idk if it matters when I buy.
It’s cheaper to purchase tickets a month early than a week before you intend to leave
idk why I cant find the date on their website
a few weeks earlier i think
but why get a mac when you could get a pc :P
We aren’t going over this again lol
switching from pc to mac, i've never looked back
Ew PC
apple is never the gamer move
correct we aren't gamers
we are college students
who says college students can't be gamers
I can’t imagine a college student having time to game
ran doom eternal at 90 fps
But in college you have more work
And they take longer to complete
STEM majors have a lot of work
I genuinely don’t know about humanities though
I don’t know why
maybe he didn't like accounting
I don’t know he said he wanted to dedicate his life to working in education but now his administration is ignoring those who are voicing their experiences of facing racism at school
I don’t know but I wouldn’t be surprised. They don’t do anything helpful
I don’t know what his beliefs are
idk what i want to major in so besides the math class idk what else to pick
I dont think so,
Do you want me to get you a link?
Do you want the link?
i got unluckly, the only math i can take is 8am mwf
Plus I wanted large chunks of time to study/do ec’s
8am start time, so i woke up tossed some clothes on and got out the door
Even earlier if I needed to finish work
Damn
See I can’t. I need to eat lol
Snacking ain’t it for me
I don’t know why
I just don’t
so i could get away with waking up round 7:50-8
I really hope the walks aren’t that long since it’s a small school
I just don’t wanna be that one cringey freshman that runs to each class
when u could sprint cuz ur already 10min late
it does look im having a noon lunch tho
but idk if this specific one
oh
You just indicate (I don’t know where) what type of sages
yea, we cant view those yet sadly
Flavortown, OH
thats worse than chaz
nah it's not a debate if there's only 1 correct answer
it's not a debate if i kill my opponent
nothing out of the ordinary, but will he be using "facts and logic" to destroy his opponent?
9/10 it is tho
i mean for starts they ran out of food on day 2 of the "experiment"
considering i took a whole english lit class on utopias and how they have failed and will fail i think i know
ic, cant say i've used that flavor of spyware yet tbh
i've only stuck to the more vanilla flavors
'merica, land of the free to die how u please
Sometimes we die bc Government
cuz 1.7mil bill for rona treatments
okay ppl don't have much food to start with in that zone, it's in the heart of Seattle. they're attempting subsistence farming to no avail cuz the soil in the park sucks. so the seattle municipality is giving food to the CHAD's which is just dumb
That’s not dangerous tho
When has violence ever stopped a movement lol
violence wont solve violence
they aren't autonomus
And I doubt ppl will die but I guess we’ll see
People didn’t think ppl could die from protesting yet here we are
i just know that if someone declared my backyard an "autonomus zone" bc of its proximity to a landmark, say city hall. I'd be pissed. In fact I'd want to do everything in my power to shut it down. Even if it means hiring a private police force to remove them. This parallel is the same for those independent shop owners who have their shops BROKEN INTO and used as quarters for these anarchists.
i don't stand with ppl breaking the law
regardless the cause
cuz they can have my 5sqft "yard" as a zone, kinda small zone
FUCK
NOPE EMPIRE
Wait hold on breaking the law isn’t an issue bc there’s probably a ton of laws we’re breaking that haven’t been repealed yet
not that i want to enforce
Laws you want enforced
that WE want to enforce
Aw okay ion count as part of that
So you want citizens to hold each other accountable?
Like I said, laws you want enforced
isnt that ur thing tho
rip
So is murdering but, law enforcement still exists
have you seen the thing where a company tried to sue a dead guy
they didnt realize he was dead
I like it when they still tax dead ppl
taxing the dead
ofc u can sue a dead person
Taxation without representation
someone made a biz out of 3d printing houses
t u really tho?
i'm living the 7 seconds of my life flash before my eyes before i die
thats how the recession happened
It could solve homelessness though
Not if the government doesn’t allow it
why solve homelessness tho
I hate the government
If they already don’t allow tent cities no way they’ll let something like this in
tell them, its ur fault ur poor
I can’t wait til Gen Z takes over
But in capitalism it’s so hard to move up
Don’t put too much faith in us lol
It’s hard to go from rags to riches
pri, hate to burst ur bubble, but when "we" take over
The come up do be hard
nothing will change
cuz the people who are ruling now
Anarchy the country to nothing
Also apparently chaz has renamed to chop for Capitol Hill organized protest
i dunno
Oh wtf
That was late
My bad
*it looks like you are trying to talk to a webpage, would you like help with that?*
Oh
I'm a fucking boomer so
I've been on discord since it came outb
I just can't understand 10% of gen z slang
I'm not a fan of zoom either tho..
I hurt
Fuck you got that up so quick htf
OMG WTF
well, i am a bad example of that
Damn
but i dont use my phone
Damn you must game at least
havent tried wolfenstein tho
Mm I hear everyone in cod these days can fly and run off walls n shit
Used to be so damn simple... Lol
nope, the went back to boots on the ground combat
Minecraft.. still trying to get it lol
It seems to do anything in mc
You could get into the telescope after hours
And then you could always drop majors like it was nothing
A lot tho
shame they changed it, but probably too much abuse
It was a whole big thing w me and the deans by the end tho
It's weird now tho
Yet a different major that needs two more advisors
I left finals week of spring 2018
Sry I forgot to ask
did you manage to avoid your finals?
Did someone in your fam go to case too?
nope, i'm gonna be the first
my mom went to school in her country, but i couldnt pronounce that name
i know a bit, but i never tried real hard to learn it
I feel so bad whenever I c my advisors who are polish
Mmeh it prolly won't hurt you
Idk how to pronounce half their names
Which is sad cuz
They get upset
but damn
Ouch
Mm I didn't really speak any 1 until iwas 4 or 5
My dad spoke to me only Spanish my mum in Italian school in French and my cousin's only in Portuguese
It wasn't too confusing
Very slow progress
I'd been going to school in the us since I was 3 tho
So 4th grade was LATE
I can't remember how to speak Luxemburgish at all tho funny enough even tho I was born there
So I got stuck w obscure stuff like latin and ancient Greek
ouch
Those rly helped tho
fair enough latin is like a root language
You started so early
well, according to my mum, it was when i was in poland and did something to a vcr that got it working again when i was like 3
i snip all neel, some not to be shown to the public eye
You sold yourself down a little howdyy
Wt were you supposed to snip
yea, plus it allows you to look back and remember events that u might have forgot
aka fat cats
Fat cat*
Oh shit wow
O can't believe that's a real squirrel
Rn I'm working in Cambridge till the end of the month
they get fat over hre
people leaving food about
Damn
I just ate cereal rn
i dont hate the smell
don't they say like 80% of taste is smell?
honestly i don't have a disposition to monday
I hate tuesdays
You can still be optimistic come Monday
fair enough
Because after Monday is over I’m so tired Tuesday morning
Plus usually my bad days occur on Tuesday’s
bad days?
Like I did bad on a test or have a conflict with someone
Or things just go wrong
except w/ neel
Sorry I start skipping words when I'm tired lol
Uhhh I don’t know?
Oh
Oh
cuz u didnt seems to reconize the name change
Sorry I should say role
I’m a discord noob I didn’t start using it so much until this year
It's not Tuesday yet
well, status update, couldnt tell what exploded
but its not exploding anymore
Oh
And the sky turned bright neon blew at like 3 am for twenty mins
It was so damn pretty
damn
and afaik no ones dead
so i guess it dont matter
Aren't most of us here gen z?
I guess most of us here will be making memes even when the world is 3 seconds away from ending
What's the biggest difference between gen z and millenials tho
You're not wrong
Is that actually boomer age tho
I’ve read in various places GenZ is from 1997 to 2012 but I don’t know
I feel bad now
Yeah I don’t know what the actual cutoffs are though
Math1 and 2 are  required for bio major?
I place out of math 1 , but I took ap calc ab like year or more ago so I don't rmbr shii
So idk if I should go straight to math 2
If you don’t remember anything then you should retake it
You don’t wanna struggle
Like is math 2 just a continuation or separate topics
Bc if it's separate topics then ig It doesn't matter
Idk. It's just Th at I gotta fit all these other courses and idk if I should waste ma time takin math.2nd
Hold up I forgot y'all r freshman too
Idk I was just wondering what any upper class men did did u jump right to mAth 2 or nah?
many didn’t make the jump from calc 2 to calc 3 thou
is math 224 hard
@mag3is most people don’t start with calc 3 if they have the credit?
some people i know didnt
Unless Calc 2 feels super easy to me in the first few weeks but I’m taking things slow first semester
Has anyone’s navigator enrolled them in their courses yet?
they don’t enroll you
But tbh I had the same question if people already started enrolling now bc on SIS some classes had like seats taken... ??
Also apart from math 1 and 2 anyone skip from chem 1 to chem 2?
Yea bc I got chem 1 credit from ap exam but idk if I should skip to chem 2 (chem 106 ) anyone upperclassmen done that?
> @sprinkles2108 I think that we can put courses in our shopping cart now and then later in July we can actually enroll
@Deleted User  oh yeah I added them to my cart but I don’t want to lose my spot which is why I was wondering if any ‘24’s have officially enrolled yet
Idk bro I didn't add anything to my cart
Oh same for the larger pre med classes there’s really only one time
But I don't wanna have a clsss in the middle of the day
Yea premeda don't rlly need calc
And idk maybe some med schools
Bruh can't I just stay in hs
the mermaid con thing wants payment
im kinda scared doe
yea, math is early in the morn
My math class is at 10:40...
But I’m taking Calc 2 so it could differ for other courses
@stuckinohiolads nah math 224 is the easiest of the calc sequence
Um 224 isn’t calc tho
@Deleted User math two is mostly advanced integration and applications
Fuck
I don’t want to take anymore calc rip
Oh
I already took linear tho
Oh
And my major only needs 224
Sad
If you want an ez A in 224 tho take prof Zhao
Is so bad
J a bad, bad class
Differential isn’t that much for multi variables
Math 307 is a bitch
@stuckinohiolads are you a math major?
wait a minute I have a 5 on the bc test and took a calc 3 course last year, what math should I take?
I’m not a math major
and since my multi class took the 2017 cwru final for math 223 he let me skip it
since i got a passing score on it
That’s what I’m doing with Calc 2. I took bc this year and while I think I did well on the AP exam I’m not confident that my skills are solid enough for Calc 3. Also, I want to first get accustomed to how teaching is at cwru so that I know what to anticipate in higher classes like math 223
i may be wrong but for math 224 (diff eq) besides knowing how to take partial derivatives there is nothing from math 223 (multivariate calc) required
so couldn't you hypothetically skip 223 and go to 224?
But I haven't seen that too commonly used
At least they used to. Idk if they still take it
Oh ok. Is there a list on the website of who accepts case cash? I couldn’t find one myself
It wasn't maintained
Oh
At the end of 8 semesters
So I had 300 on my card when I left
And when I left
I j got sick and left
*shrug* at least it was just one surgery nd gone
It's an ez class to ace if you have experience
And I don’t wanna have bad grades
J go to office hours often
Uhh I don’t know who my prof is but it was all the same
Idk about w covid anymore
He doesn't wear shoes to class
And they come to office hours
They're some very basic dif eq at the end
mosquitoes need to slow their roll
So based on what I read, it seems like you need a legit reason to not come to campus. Is that true?
well if a student says i cant come bc of travel issues and theyre from cleveland im p sure admin will be like. excuse me
I don’t know if I can be like sorry no
I wonder how they’ll hand disabilities tho
But someone nearby would probably use the health excuse
and health u probably will need like evidence of a covid test thats positive
Bc I was gna say that most kids who actual need it are already talking to office of disabilities
who need what
Bc I have a valid reason to not be on campus but I’ll force myself to go if clinicals and labs are still going on this year
labs i imagine will still happen
last yr lab was like 20 so theyll prob half it
clinicals i mean. i know that ppl in my year have already been given their placement so i guess theyre still happening
i can't sleep when it's light out 😦
so my school uses parchment to send final transcripts, and parchment says my final transcript was received by case on june 2, its now june 21 and my portal still says my final transcript has not been received yet.
wait on mine it says that final high school transcript  is received but not the leaving exams one
bc some ppl dont take final exams b/c of covid
yeah i didnt lol
at my school seniors don't take final exams
I didn’t take final exams as a senior
optional final exams might be the dumbest thing ive ever heard of...
i mean who would take a final exam if they didnt have to
I'm really struggling with that
@beth9746 i did email my navigator, she said to email admissions, i emailed admission twice in last 2 days and they stil havent responded
Oh they don’t check emails ok the weekend
sorry not last 2 days, last 5 days
Hmm idk
the processing time shouldnt be this long, dunno why it still shows as an X
I requested to have my final transcript sent to Case but I can’t find my confirmation number. So I emailed my counselor to confirm if it got sent and well, she’s officially off for the summer so now I have to call someone to ask!
how tf we gon have a pe class if we have virtual clas
I don’t know
it was terrible
u arent going to get one anyways
@stuckinohiolads well both arent checked 4 me
they all closed
imma go fucking nuts
Super comf > Topical
“Ehhhh” > Foundational
Tf is stupid American English? > non native
The questions at the bottom of the sages placement are supposed to help you decide which is best for you
so i called the admission office and no one was there bruh
all the PHED classes are gone
well all the ones I wanted atleast
Yeah most of them have been gone
so phed isn't necessary during 1st semester?
Nope. You just need 2 semesters total over the course of 4 years to graduate
I wanted to take a swimming class but I think they’re for beginners
Apparently there’s also a yoga class too
one of my hobbies is boxing and I use it to burn fat
Wanna know how I don’t gain weight
I have a bad habit of overeating so I just exercise to keep my weight in check
trying to fix it
longer than I want to admit
and I lost 25 kilos over break
I don’t eat when I’m nervous and stressed
damn it worked the opposite way for me
But I can’t eat when I’m stressed
I thought freshie 15 came from heavy drinking tho
I don’t know
can't eat lots of food when you don't have enough money for it
the poor man's diet
Usually they’re still listed as op/ed
am i the only 1 that doesnt like smash ultimate?
nahh smash 4 too slow man ultimate #1
i think smash ultimate skill floor too damn high
they need a smash ultimate m
Cajun or nothing
hoes mad
i swear man english too hard
i didnt do that
is the writing hard
so u dont have 300 ping
love cleveland weather, it was raining yesterday, it's raining today and here's the forecast
haha rain  go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I'm crying alrdy
Fuck me
I stopped watching In btwn a long break they had
And now I can't understand where I left off
H.o why can't I remember made In abyss sound track imma play it rn
Shit.
I hope the nether turns into Dimension W [the anime] type shit
i feel like ours is gonna be trash compared
I’m hoping it’ll still be somewhat fun even with social distancing
you can only orientate so much, i wonder if they will just redesign it completely and not try to push a half working one
I will be sad if they make it completely virtual
for us tho?
I’ve been to campus a few times and even though it’s small imma get lost
cleveland to the west tho
But we’re still in Cleveland
and then it kicks back up round the hospital and we have case
im hyped for that shit
Idk lol
OH YEAHH
tho i got 2 nerf revolvers
i wanted to do hvz so bad when i got super into nerf like 5 years ago
*tho i may have taken apart 1 of them, oops*
nerf has really dominated the market
their slogan nerf or nothing does ring tru
you either get nerf, or u get nothing
uhhh some of those darts aren’t allowed
never heard of waffle head ones
everyday i wake up i lowkey hope to check my phone and see like a corona cure in the news even tho i know thats not gonna happen for awhile
people are working on it tho
bruh what if they already have a cure and are holding it until as many people have it as possible
You’re not that wrong tbh
A mentor even asked me “I’m surprised... have you used a drill before?” Yes mike I watched bob the builder now leave me alone
ur telling me first is worse than vex
cuz i have doubts
I don’t know how vex is
I’ve never heard of it until I joined this server
I don’t think FIRST rules are that bad
Shoot I didn’t intend to put it that way
"New single use sensors" 
I lose it at that
I have a feeling you’re purposely attacking me Neel
i don't attack anyone on the server
unless they hate straight ppl @mag3is
straight people suck
i mean how do you know you are straight if you’ve never tried?
I mean as a straight guy its major soft if I see another so that is my sign. idk for girls. dry? (I am have joking and half serious)
I’ve never felt attracted to girls
Just don’t be straight smh
It’s not hard
Just, don’t.
ok i was getting worried since i submitted my shopping cart on the 11th
ugh your straightness is against my religion. like why would a man and a women be in a relationship?? like how does it even work??
idk but khan academy (our lord and savior Sal Khan) says "Organisms have goals. The short-term goal is to self-generate and self-maintain in a given environmental context. The long-term goal is to pass genome copies on to offspring, a goal that succeeds only if self-generation and self-maintenance succeed."
What are you even trying to say
YOU CANT CHOOSE TO BE A SEXUALITY
i mean i don't choose to be straight
Sorry I’m naturally attracted to men
I mean I can’t control that
Hell it is I guess
I’m sorry but the Bible says that heterosexuality is wrong so
I don’t follow the Bible
"The American Psychological Association (APA) takes the position that a variety of factors impact a person's sexuality. The most recent literature from the APA says that sexual orientation is not a choice that can be changed at will, and that sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors...is shaped at an early age...[and evidence suggests] biological, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality (American Psychological Association 2010)."
🤦‍♀️ i mean seriously do you guys not like understand what i’ve been saying
straight ppl bad ^
And I’m probably gonna die alone
i don’t want kids seeing it and getting the wrong idea
The only idea they’ll get from me in public is that it’s ok to be lonely
There are some idiots who say you can't commend a man if you are a man. That is the far side of the spectrum. a little less far are the men who can admit "Damn bro you lookin mighty fine today" then there are Bi, confident women, and conservative women.
bi doesn’t exist
it’s just wrong to like the opposite sex
I want a mans
And if no man wants me then I have Clifford
StRaIgHtS sUcK ok Mag we get it
i want a high gpa
issa joke oml. y’all don’t get it obviously
i want to pass:(
Gay men are so much nicer too
Like I’m scared I’m gonna struggle to find a nice straight man
I don’t know
she's not wrong
that would honestly be the worst
bi people aren’t cheaters
if i may, in the last of us 2, this happens in the beginning
sorry for the spoiler
Oh
pls don't kill me
i see i missed another battle of the dumbasses
Shoot I can’t afford to get any dumber
Can’t get any dumber when you don’t have any brain cells to begin with
I on the other hand apperently cant spell brain
we already got enough
rip revolution
Jesus wtf is going on
Me not knowing how discord bots work and watching all this happen👁👄👁
or just a boring one
I never stuck around too long cuz they were always hosted at 3am in korean time
Would enough ppl agree on a movie tho
fortunatly for us the communist revolution failed and were left with the dictator Roman
Aw man I miss watching Barney
And Barney was the man in the suits pedo dream
Rip
WONT YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME TOO
Sorry I don’t find pedofiles dressed as purple dinosaurs attractive
99% is still a fail
Shit
Sad to hear it
nope
Not the new age shit tho I’m talking about the 90s stuff
I was supposed to do one for my graduation but Rip
I’ll get it whenever I can be in stores again, just won’t hit the same
Aw🥺
Aw
Scare away intruders
We need a formal intro for him
still a cwru ‘24 server guys 😔
@.0.0.0._ you have officially lost your privilege to play with Clifford
Damn u really got me
Hey does anyone know where I can find that article on how school will work next year with social distancing? I’ve been trying to find it but I can’t seem to.
> Hey does anyone know where I can find that article on how school will work next year with social distancing? I’ve been trying to find it but I can’t seem to.
@hisoblivion  https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/health-serviceshealth-updatescovid-19-campus-communications/june-21-message-faculty-and-staff-fall-planning-and-reducing-risk
And someone brought up Clifford
And people wanted to see him
and, who doesnt like the big red dog :P
Haters don’t like him
thats what they say, but they actual dont
ngl when you wrote you had a clifford toy i got really scared that it would turn super weird
but yeah u cant hate Clifford, hes cute:)
(im really bored rn lol)
now theres 2 of them idk what to think about that
we got enough roles already
Oh to see without my eyes
Neel why don’t you realize that howdy is too fast
or dont be a weenie
Don’t be shy delete them
oh oops wrong chat
bruh corona already fucked up my senior year man
dude i'd rather them do nothing ngl
thats not gonna work
Oh
Well yeah can’t do that
i agree with sam online wont work
I feel really bad for internationals rn
Are you still coming to campus?
rip
I want fwends
oh then why not
My mom is still uncomfortable with sending me off to college in general
like even if we get coronavirus we cant really spread it to old people so i dont think thats a big issue hopefully
Like she never liked the idea of me living elsewhere for school
i mean id be hard to isolate though
since you have a roomate
I’m hoping so
Oh
since some people may not want to come this year
damn dude ur 18 they cant make u stay
Age doesn’t matter
but still
I want to come to campus
I need social interaction
i mean everyone at college is gonna be feeling the same type of way yeah
I probably won’t be nervous
its fine everyone will probably have spent so much time alone theyll be craving interction
rip
I can’t imagine being color blind
soi know how it feels
nah scam ass shit
Couldn’t be me
And they start crying
i saw logan paul do that shit with the sunset lmao
Aw doggo 🥺🥺
oh dear
OMG DO IT
haha nah he hates baths enough
Aw:(
well he hates getting in baths then he loves it afterwards
Awwww
Aww:)
Well guys I just lost a 1050 day streak on snapchat
i stopped using snapchat like a month into quarantine
also RIP
I don’t talk to many people on snapchat
did u lose all your streaks or just the one
Except case people cuz we’re getting to know each other
I somehow never sent them yesterday
rip
Eh whatever I’m probably gonna lose them all when I start school
i dont have snap unfortunatly:(
ik i was supposed to create one like 3 years ago, downloaded the app and then just never got around to doing it:(
honestly i'm just so used to procratinating it ill probably never get around to it now lol
nahh im even greater, I didnt start most of my corona school work until after they were due:)
Oh sir
Because I still got most of them in time
lol I abused the pass fail system lol
We did. We just couldn’t get anything lower than our quarter 3 grade
Senioritis was bad for me this year
This fall I’m probably gonna go back to being a try-hard freshman
try hard until november, collapse as winter aproachs, try hard jan, collaspse before feb, and then I never recover until sep
Thing is we can’t collapse before finals
Ik its gona be hrd though
Id much rather be at school prepping for finals
See I liked distance learning because I didn’t have to see toxic people anymore
Now I wish we did distance learning for another reason
But I think with cwru I’m not gonna wanna leave campus
yeah but hopefully it wont be to toxic:)
I’m reallyyyyy hoping I don’t encounter toxic people
My class was full of awful people
and some classes where nobody gave a shit
I just want a positive change from high school watch that end up being too much to ask for
honestly my HS was lit idk if college could live up to the crackheadiness of my HS
Maybe you just need to find your crackheads❤️
They’re still allowing roommates
It was sorta up in the air whether it’d be only singles or nah
i found the daily temperature checks stupid tho
Isn’t that what friendship is all about though
Everything else seems okay but the dining situation
Mm but then kitchen traffic will be much higher which is more dangerous
Oh
You don’t transfer anything yet. You register for classes based on what you think you’ll get for credit
do I want to know?
... if this feeling flows both ways @jujulb (pls know the song)
I've heard that it isn't bad but you get tired of it
What’s wrong with the dining hall
Feel like that’s true for any sorta of college dining
so idk
Bugs do be in fresh things tho
No kitchens like that tho
i did not want to know this:(
Asking this since the class bs is due tmrw
Idk
I think there’s only one biol 214 class
Math122 has like 4 listings with the same teacher same time and same everything except I think its
I saw that too I don’t know why that is
because math 122 is a smaller class size
Oh but the timings are the same ?
Diff teachers doing the same class probs
They have yet to determine the location tho
Well you can’t change that lol
Ok but why don't they have variety like cmon man.
It shouldn’t affect your scheduling
Huh. Like their timings suck
My timings seem to work out
Ye the timing should work out
Just probably not the times you want
Yea lol. I didn't wanna take 50 diff subjects in one day
They haven’t put the actual profs in each slot
Bc what if we choose one slot and don't like the professor
Bc we still have to buy the classes I’m sure you can go back
But maybe for the smaller math classes we can pick
I mean u do get what I'm saying right. like if we choose one time slot and the prof changes then we r stuck with then and can't choose
Rip
That’ll probably only be a first time issue though because after that we don’t have to go thru this whole approval process
Oh for freshman
Yo there's only one time slot for math 122 also
For the core classes you don’t really have a choice
Lol it’s due tomorrow
It's due tmrw my g
Due tomorrow as wel
I have like 340 words and i'm so stuck
i did mine at work heheheh
It’s just to see how much we suck at writing
I suck
I don’t understand why they couldn’t have read our personal statements from our apps
Bc it wasn’t argumentative
At least mine wasn’t
God dont remind me im trying to procrastinate
i mean although the due date is tomorrow its not like they gonna reject u if u turn it in late
sorry to bother you guys again
but can anyone explain "Credit for MATH 121 will meet a requirement for either MATH 121 or 125" to me?
I still don't know if I should skip chem 1 👁👄👁
But IDK
If you don’t think you can take 125 you can take 121 and you will fulfill whatever basic math required
yeah i think math 121 and math 125 are both the first class out of a two math class sequence and that credit will allow u to skip the first one of the two class sequence
Basically getting 5 on AB will let you skip math 121 or math 125. And the higher the number the harder the class. Like 125 vs 121.
But math 121 is more equivalent to the calc u took in high school
125 is math for life and social science and math 121 is for engineering i think
Yea I'm skipping math 1 and taking math 122
Uh technically I guess so
125/126 are both the easier maths
Yea so math 122 is required too
yeah so u would go to math 126
So skip math 121 and take 122 or yea 126
Idk why they have 2 courses for it
if you want to do a BS in bio then take 122
Majors n class space n all that
but if ur not rlly worried about math being a big thing then take 126 bc easier
I just need to fulfil pre med reqs
like for BA in compsci you can do maths 125/126 but im doing 121 cause im a sadist
Imagine doing a math class lmao
the math 121/122 sequence is for engineering ppl and the math 125/126 is for “life and social sci” people therefore... easier
but no other math classes
I got credit for math 1, so now I have to take math 2. But which should I take 122 or 126
Noice so no more math
@tomatoandmayo i emailed they said you can always substitute for a harder maths
i thought it was required for mine too
126 is part 2 of 125 which is the math for non engineering majors
Bruh I don't need math at all I just need it for my bio major requirement. And so idk math 122 or 126. Bc the descroprion  for 122 sounds easier
... oh so it's not 122 then?
I don’t know
200s aren't necessarily harder than 100s courses however, 200s could just mean an intro to a more narrow focus than 100 level courses
Then why does math 126 course description more daunting than math 122
maths 126 is like calc applications and social science
I don't need math
then take 125 it says it’s recommended for ppl who don’t plan on taking more than 2 semesters
Idk I thought since 122 and 121 are like what we did in high school it would be exiled
the stats aren't gonna be as hard as an actual stat class either
Not yet
but placement is taking a test and if you pass you can get the credit for it
some people self study to take placement tests
chem is my worst nightmare lol
But like did u skip math 1 also
it’s not that hard tbh
to be fair how hard people think a course is depends on who you hear it from
Lol for math 121/122 + 125/126
The difference is 121 class is theoretical calc
Like what math majors like
U took math 122 and 126?
I just want the easier one
Basically you cant go wrong
If you go to office hours you'll prolly ace
The class
on the other hand the prof for 125 is awful lmao
I mean she's not bad in class
Oh shii
I don’t know if you mentioned him yet
what would u recommend for bio major who took ap calc and have credit for math 1 but need to take math 2 but otherwise don't gf abt math
I can't say I personally spoke to prof contenza (teaches math 125/126) but my friend described his office hours experience negatively
bro just do 126 if you want easier
Not for the math
A very gentlew into  college
I don't roll that way
:eggplanthand: bruh this emote wtf
i think it’s bc the upperclassmen have already signed up
rip pe classes 😩😔😔
😓  makes sense but still sucks ass lmao
rip freshmen
I like pe but freshman don't get to take it 😦
Apparently there’s a way to prevent it from happening but I don’t know what that is
i went to this college summer thing and so many people didnt and it was disgusting
Apparently some ppl brush their teeth every other day
I can’t imagine not brushing my teeth
I dont undertand why you woudnt do at least 1
Bruh not keeping your teeth clean can cause problems
so brush your damn teeth
Idk I already had a tooth filled
So I mean even good dental hygiene can lead to problems
Or a bad diet can
Coffee is apparently bad for ur teeth
I can’t drink coffee thru a strawww
Don’t mouth wash with it?
Well kids don’t smoke either because damaging your lungs is even worse
they probably figured out that the first semester professor didnt really care about content retention
It’s so fucking annoying
I need a high science gpa
engr 145 isnt "that" bad
transition is rough. Some things covered in chem 105 arent covered in chem 111
Rip
my professor didn’t know how to teach franklin
Drew meyers is on the exact opposite end of the spectrum
More like this is where we should spend 75% of our studying time
cuz like i took calc sophomore so idk but also don’t wanna waste my time bored to death
welp im dead then
it most likely wont daven lmao
because i worked in cleveland clinic labs all throughout HS and that stuff doesnt translate
Like I never used electrochem or thermochem in the UT labs
yeah dont expect that to translate over
aww
that's a rip
at least your orientation isnt completely online
tho their roomate policy is a bit odd
and with people naturally inclined to go off campus to places like food, etc., this is gonna be one hell of a year
beds are already on opposite sides of the room wym
i know why they didnt space the rooms, the more rooms open, the more $ they can get from room&board
Fair assessment
so moving the beds
I assume end to end
bruh imagine this shit was like ebola but as contagious
To maximize head distance
like thankfully its not mad deadly
ye, if it was more deadly, i have a feeling online would be all we're doing
@syberkonda I have the role but I don’t live in that county nor have I been tested/diagnosed with it
I don’t know one night crackhead energy was soaring on here
And I wanted a special role
what if it was tho
But damn it makes me feel more manly than I am already
thats quality shit
You didn’t declare it’s type
You forgot the semicolon
Sorry sir
> let neeL = "Smol Boi";
@smichalski882  it won’t work you have to say n e e L
Omg, hope they feel better
Most of them are doing ok but one has some preexisting conditions and hasn't improved or worsened since at least last week
whoever is marketing head needs elp
👉👈🥺 - my summer plans
nah ron, u need eggplant and peach to get booted
I’d rather retake that 16 personalities test
its laughably bad
Uh oh
but doesnt say what the rta is
idk rta is a reasonably common phrase
What’s the r stand for shouldn’t it b c for Cleveland
I can’t comment on that
like at school, the chicken was either raw or dry no inbetween
but siracha covers that up like nothing else
and neel, the onlything mac n cheese needs
the title is too long and i cant see the date
oh nvm
I haven't checked the releases from OH. I just hope they didn't reopen too early but prob did being a red state.
but we're not fully reopened just yet, somethings are still closed for the immediate future
from what i've heard dewine is gonna close some things down again
Yeah cuz there was a spike today
Beth I don’t have a hydroflask but I do have reusable water bottles
Oh to see without my eyes
Guess who just submitted her SAGES essay🤪🤪🤪🤪
Hydroflasks are fun. I don't put stickers on mine but I do on my other bottle.
they upload their sages essays to the applicant portal. Their sages professors will eventually get it, but as far as i know, most didnt do anything with them. Had i known, i wouldnt have even written my essay
i never did them
So even if people didn’t turn in an essay they would’ve been ok?
idk my strat for any argumnetative essay is to take the middle ground
so it always seems to work out
Tho in this essay I was a little bit closer to the middle but still leaned toward one side
i didn't counter at all i just kinda built off her argument
rip
idk
Who knows my essay probably sucks then
It is just given to see if you need to be put in a class for writing or if you are good enough for a topics class
My essay took her argument further. Instead of just saying I agree with her side, I also took the reader on an investigation of why the problems occur and then offered potential solutions to those problems while mentioning the limitations of those solutions and the benefits of dealing with those limitations
If it’s 2 AM I am asleep
then ig you've never read Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy
that shit read like a shitpost on reddit
but damn it was good
literally the ending of the book (which is up to speculation but the consensus is) (SPOILER) ||the main antagonist rapes/sodomizes to death the protagonist in an outhouse||
this serial killer stuff seems more and more likely each day
essencially, dont walk alone at 3am and u'll be fine(ish)
i tried the college roomie site, but didnt get much luck there
so i guess so
Yeah I heard it’s hard to get 100%
if anyone thinks im kidding
its absolutly hilarious, but i didnt really get much luck from it
if one of the 10rooms is a single, i'll go 4 it, but if not, i guess im randomizing
so if I get someone terrible, I hopefully will be able to get an out
rip
nope
so how does that work
oh trueee
well i selected my rom and now the website just stuck on processing
wtf how did it not crash lol
we close by
Clarke wasn’t even an option wtf
rip pri
you have to go to the dropdown menu in the middle of the page and click on where it says request a roommate
woah, mine doesnt look like that
i just closed the dropdown tabs
well in my confirmation email there are two RA numbers so i guess that means my roommate got my room too
oh shit yeah mine's totally different
Sorry I meant #roles
i havn heard of anyone gettingit yet
though some ppl saw singles
I took a risk too bc i refreshed and shit
\
@.0.0.0._ @wuhoo4158  would you guys be able to make roles/channels based on the residential communities/buildings?
U less @sar.hh or another @Admin (I guess)🙄 wants to
I b tired
i’m tired too 😴
So I can play Gtav online without lagging on my PC?
She hears that and wont be living on campus
Going back to Buckeye after spending so much time on CaseWireless is gonna suck
cause your in smith
you dont see the houses your not in
damn, a true CS major
tru i guess
i hate it meg
Honestly if there's a need for someone from Taplin to talk to Smith they can just type in the Smith chat
do u mean the juniper chat bc tap ppl dont have access to the smith chat
general chats are useful when you need batteries
I feel u sam untill like a month ago i only got between 1-5 down
Like you have to hold down (I realized) to see the stuff
don't they have a fiber connection in every room?
do i really want to ping everyone
it doesn't *have* to be a ping
oh god oh fuck its been 4 minutes and my navigator hasnt joined the meeting
was i supposed to email them or smt to set up the meeting
my navigator was like 6 minutes late
is it cause its already past the due date 😳
sorry fam u out
missed the deadline
but also the website doesnt let u make meetings after the end of june...
maybe hes getting back at me for not showing up to the last meeting
Not on top of their shit
And honestly they don't do much rly
Unless you want something from them
i dont rly
Or else they get mad at you
You don't want that
It's bad
This is after you missed meeting one?
idk just like we need to meet or smt
i dont think he specifically referenced that i had missed one
i think tmrw is like the last day lolk
ye, i havent talked to the navigator after that first meeting
I'm sure even if it doesn't happen tomorrow you're fine
they aint v useful
Just don't be on their bad side tho
They can make college V e r y annoying
weird they didnt show up then
that doesnt happen till july
ooh i forgot the college of engineering is weird
My navigator forgot we were calling and not video calling on Zoom
i don’t think the SAGES classes will full those requirements
rip
omg big rip
rip
indeed, i dont want to write more
i feel like the class will hopefully be a bit of a breeze
idk what a sages departmental seminar is tho
ok so i guess it’s a SAGES class u take junior year
well, dont they got that dish washer place
Spectrum sucks big time
were they literally all taken
fuck
yea man, rooms flew quickly last night
i dont know if they release rooms besides that date unfortuantly, you'd have to ask someone from previous years
is storrs bad or just worse than cutter
just worse than cutter
oh I'm not expecting much
all I need is a desk and a bed and I can live
heres hoping no corona on plane
GL on the flight
mm well at least you’ll be able to start a lot of international kids prob won’t be able to
yeah im lucky im with the embassy they're able to schedule repatriation flights for me
I can do it if y'all want
its far too late, the zucc has already succ'd
damn, lots of insta leaves, i guess we arent as cool as we hoped
Looks like someone left and rejoined the server multiple times
i hate driving so much
and my mom says, will complete seriousness, this is why I dont believe we ever landed on the moon
Oh dear
ive honestly only found 2 ppl on my floor so far:(
honestly im surprised though, it seems like nobody wanted to be in the co-ed dorms
i dont think its much of a choice, its mostly luck of the draw
im kinda sad though
my search for clarke made me miss out on juniper
well, u do get the option to move during the semester if you really dont like where ur at
and I didnt realize until recently...
Cedar is the only dorm without foosball:(
I just wanted to play foosball lol
rip, i was going for ping pong, cuz that fun
i went to a sleepaway camp over the summer a few years ago, and I stayed like 2 days by myself between camps
and I honestly practiced like 8 hours of foosball each day cause I was so bored
but I havnt found a place with a foosball table since then so im probably shit now
i didnt even know there were dorms with foosball tbh
i forgot my own downstairs common room lol
taft had pool and foosball so i forgot about the foosball
im just stupid
and now im sad again:(
well if you cant beat them
thomas getting booted, big rip
I can’t seem to find my AP score on sis
Im just going off what was on the website so idk
yeah i don’t think everyone got a housing role
Don’t buy the CWRU dorm stuff. It’s bad
with everything going on i forgot its almost time to play everyones fav game, gunshots or fireworks
norton is this cybersecurity program that makes itself really hard to uninstall, so you keep paying for it
Didn’t know that
@akumaenjeru is norton shit
oh that
compared to other dorms at least whenever I went to norton it seemed worse
now idk if my timing w norton was just at bad times but
Tbh I think bathrooms are gonna be really clean this year cuz covid cleaning
ye, i feel sanitation and cleanliness is really going to be enfoced
Did you download norton on my laptop and hacked me?
Oh the fake Minecraft download buttons
tho to be real, im shocked how some people refuse to use adblockers today
It makes me feel like someone remembers I exist 💗
cutler was feeling left out so i gave em a friend lol
You mean they’re not trying to contact just me?
You mean the Instagram sugar daddy dms aren’t real??? 🤨
christian, those hoes aint loyal
the longer the icon of sin stays on earth
ur not wrong christian
ur not wrong
infact, watch them increase it stating they need more money to better combat covid
and the damn broken ping pong table
So annoying
@akumaenjeru bruh stop I feel like I’m going into the trenches or something
but that is consistent with many dorms without the filtration fountatins
@howdy_. shit
rip
one of the few places where their ping pong table is actually functional and some paddles that aren't plain wood
Idk I never had any
never had any waht
we dont have a orientation week 🙃
I mean it kinda would be I guess
discipline doesn't have to be dirty in nature
discipline doesn't have to be dirty in nature
discord is broken
It really is
discord machine broke
i looked it up and it seems legit
cuz case has used hololens before, and imagine if that tech was affordable for all students
time to work on getting 800 somehow
Imagine being able to build your credit rn
bruh howdy buy me a car
first i need the money to buy one ;-;
fair enough 😔😔😔
SICK
everyone will be jealous 🙈
No one went up there last year
I went once
And never again
yeah if it’s howdy and chris.... stay away
i think neel was making attempts, but gave up after learning i wasnt a speech and debate kid
really??
No I didn’t
Rip
I should tho I need to save the turtles
I forgot this discord existed for a while
loll
~~i didn't~~
wb tho
I want to join but idk with covid
nope
i have no idea at all either
i wish
Ok my list ran out
Uhhh I can’t get it
I don’t have a noggin
I CANT FIND IT ON GOOGLE
it’s kinda a niche thing honestly i’m surprised someone made a list of money names
all the clues are out there, now u just gotta find it
nah, too many bens already
omg
damn it was right under our nose this entire time
global warming sucks
yea, we just need cooling
i see nothing wrong with this senario
he's already sent a car up, sending up all the water on earth cant be that difficult
My dad found this portable AC
You have to replace the water for the condenser every so often tho
Reposted in #deleted-channel for anyone interested so it doesn't get lost
@syberkonda you selling or giving away?
I don't even know what it's called
Haven't bought it yet
you arent allowed to bring your own ac
they want us to suffer
Not really
oh yea, we should've been able to figure that one out
jeez, the trifecta leave
FRICK I LOST MY ROLES
i wanted to see what other people saw when they first joined the server
oh, that was causing them to leave so fast
i see why that might be confusing for people who never used discord befor
OH
white names be clean tho
tru, tho we want to make this as easy as possible
and dont want porn bots
bc discord is superior to every other messaging app but it is highkey confusing if you’ve never used it before
does the sidebar be full if you have no roles tho
this is like the 3rd time they've tried to join then leave
ic, mine looks like this
if they cant understand where to go, they will leave
mine looks like that too just like if there’s unread messages in a lot of channels then everything is white and chaotic
like discord isn’t rlly that hard i think it’s just like a lil learning curve
and hopefully people dont leave so fast
cuz u dont want to get it too clutered where they cant read everything before they get bored /annoyed
maybe #deleted-channel and the roomates ones after dorming is closed for the year
so far after going through the channels, only #deleted-channel stands out as something that could get combined away
even #deleted-channel is used
rip 😔
but he dead isn’t he
oh the bot is no more?
yeah it died😭
cuz afk is kinda pointless atm, just there
idk what afk does so prolly good idea
frick, this is why we need a revolution, so these things can happen :shareit:
*i see nothing that could ever go wrong with that xD*
i just know this server can be sooo useful and such a good tool to so many people if it wasn’t so confusing
i don’t wanna disturb the mods by @ing them 😭
we can get rid of money too, no one really cares how much scholarship money you got 😳
we don’t care about the stonks
*however i dont care about how much u got :P*
we could probably move the vc and spam sections down to the bottom of the sidebar?? idk how to word that
housing under school, but before memes and vc
it just makes me sad to see ppl join and immediately leave 😭
ye, cuz they dont know what to do or where 2 go
Is that why they’re leaving? 🥺
or as far as we can guess
and if you've never used discord before
and you cant chat or anything
so you leave since ur stuck
i guess leaving would also require them to swipe over and figure out how to leave
gonna be honest i didn’t know that there were bots that could just join servers like that
yea, bots be annoying
cuz if johnny makes an invite
bad johnny
we might want to pin it
cuz i cant
i can’t.... pin anymore
oh frick
i assume julia, you cant pin either then
*now this is why we need to :shareit: with the mod*
nope 😩
rip
could #selfies📸 merge w/ #artwork🎨 since a selfie is an artwork of urself :thonk:
roman gave it back to me already we gucci
i can do it tmrw so u don’t have to do all that work
if everything is open
essencially sarah i used inspect element and moved and deleted what we didnt want
discord doesnt like that
yea, but discord doesnt like that since its constantly checking for new things
and someone types in general
me computer sometimes😎
there is nothing there
once again, idk how discord works
wait i just realized my question doesn’t need to be asked if we make rules the starting page
most choose ur own adventure books ended up w/ me dying very fast
rip
they still fun as h*ck tho
since u arent limited by paper
howdy i’ll attempt to do all of that tomorrow but i’m prolly gonna ask u questions bc i have stupid disease
this sucks
honestly i think my game always crashed before i actually made it to the end so idk what happens
i wont tell u what happens tho
both endings really are shit but I digress
wasn’t there dlc to that game or something?? i can’t remember
i thought it was bad
2nd game was mexicans running from police trying to make it from mexico after police shot their dad
it’s like house on haunted hill or something i can’t remember
still a cool concept, u become a dm once u die
bruh i didn’t even think of jackbox as an online board game
we need to play jackbox fr
nah kahoot is jackbox but 4 school
we def need to have a game night before school
like we could set up some voice chats and stuff like they did on that gamer server ? idk how that would pan out
i too broke for the flix 🙃
but im sure someone could
I’m so pissed they took megamind off of Netflix
I hate the minions 😭
thats why we dont even list that as an option
sorry i was just back tracking to our event days
where it’s a kahoot with awful pop culture and stupid questions
yeah we don’t care about real knowledge get that shit outta here
actually knowing me i’ll be like “i’m too sleepy” and miss it
rip*
crackhead hours
wot
happened
here
Like they make even the meme questions hard
Holy shit
I don't even know what Potion Seller and Topkek are
really? i thought that meme wasn't too old
:howdy_hattip: and netflix shouldnt block it out
dunno
where is howdy when we need him most
after hours anyone ehh
oh no
actually, discord seems to have not exploded
I dont think the bot will post anywhere else however
can we have the “.......joined the server” discord message go into general and get mee6 to go away
ok when you open up the sidebar to see all the channels is it swiping right or swiping left
bc it’s swiping from the left but going to the right
i dunno
i dont swipe anything
i dont think my monitor would appriciate that
smh my head
*u kno its bad when both heads are being shaken*
u should be able to see what invites are out there
i guess late u can condense the roomates chats
oh! i didnt see the red question mark
Depends on if my family wants to do something together or not
depends if i'm still awake or not lol
Guys sorry to be clueless but I have no idea what I’m on or how to use it. All the introductory things were very helpful though
but ik a lot of ppl who hate pings altogether
Meg you really do that
Do you want your Capri suns
Don’t ping ppl unless it’s like you really need to get someone’s attention
oh to see without my eyes
on the 23 server we dont have
ooo i visited illinois last year
actually
this time last year
was the day b4 i went to the airport
i’m a stem major of course i can’t spell
ayy stem majors can't spell
and have a lot of typos cuz they don't type a lot
@everyjuan isnt enabled for us, only mods and up i think
Don’t ping her
She is scary
Ok Beth I feel meh would kill me and shit on my corpse
she’s short thou
just climb to get away
I’m so short I get on a stool to wipe the floor
Jesus why does autocorrect think tall isn’t a word
It keeps changing to y’all
dunno
Stupid southern autocorrect
Still Meg can beat me up
Yeah someone asking a guy to beat his girlfriend doesn’t sound good
Oh no meg is typing
Idk I’m bored lol
Oh the ping
Oh I forgot that’s what started everything
@mag3is it wasn’t @ everyone it was the optional @ vc
Idk people have different things they don’t like
Rip
I need answers
I hate how discord does that and I don’t know how to change it on my phone
Apparently you can only change it on a computer?
Priyanka isn’t a red doggie? Tf?
And @Deleted User isn’t a sunset? Mind blown!
It turned out nicely
bruh i wish i was in korea rn 😦
it would be hard to get back to the us for school tho
what gave that away
I thought yesterday was the 4th and didn’t care so now knowing it’s actually today has me caring even less
ron, you dont want to play everyone's fav game, gunshots or fireworks?
I’ve never heard that song in full is it not just them screaming America fuck yea over and over
guys
r u sure there is gonna be uni? :critty: 
it's getting so bad
I mean if they cared they never would’ve opened in the first place
gotta not lose that money
and still charge room n board
bye bye ~~ocean~~ money
k on the real if they dont let me stay room and board imma be on the street
i mean
i still dunno if i can travel or not
no airport

RIP international students

the dont want to lose monies
We can’t do anything
tbh i dont think they going full online
ID BE MAD

Bob is reading that message and crying on his gold threaded bed
rip bob

RIP
only if case goes online tho
bob just has a knife dangling above his head
oh yeah fair
my maths and java will probs be online
depends how the situation evolves tho
Oh I’ve given up on joining any music groups til a vaccines out
Not that widespread tho
cuz i need to tinker
You won’t get herd immunity for like another year after a vaccine is out
So just bc there’s a vaccine don’t mean it’ll all b normal immediately
yea but probs wont mean all of sem 2 is online ya feel
i mean
sth like this usually takes 10 years at least
we can't talk about vaccines now :critty:
you need to be paying 42k for 1 dosage
Also I’m not tryna b the first mil or so ppl getting the vaccine without seeing any possible effects
even tho u can make the vaccine for like $10
Watch it be like the flu where you gotta take it every year
i never take flu vaccines....
Fair enough
Don’t b near me tho
Don’t have the time
u should probably get a vaccine for most stuff tho
lmao
dw
i'm in bed when there is flu
but
it's just a week's illness
why would u get a weeks illness instead of the vaccine that makes no sense
Flu do b nastee tho
i mean
dunno
i just don't take it
no one that i know takes it
ye, i mean america has antivax, but i entire counties dont even get it, whats the point on dealing with them
maybe
our country doesn't have it
prob that's why 
i'm not sure though
Also freshie flu ewww
lmaoo
dw
it's been 2 years since i last got the flu
You got the flu lol
Yea I think freshman flu will be at a low bc everyone’s being so cautious already
stay 2pi ft away :thonk:
i want a laster thermometer
but i still want one
Give us the fun hospital under the tongue ones
as i dont have $100 a year to blow on discord
ron, nitro is the subscription service to discord
Do I get money back? Is it a stocks thing?

i don't see it
Don’t use the turnip in vain
oh albert
Oh my gosh

Bro you shook me to the core initially before I realized it’s not serious
I want pasta🥺
||Fucking gunshots interrupted my masturbation.||
||So there I was. Under my bedsheets comfortable and I had some 3.9 star hentai on and then suddenly, I just hear 6 shots.||

||Now, at this point I was just pissed off because some random guy just happened to launch fireworks mid-nut. So I look out my window and see some dude runnin with a gun in his hand and another man running away from him.||

You’re better though I didn’t invest in nitro
Oh did you get it as a gift
i'm too broke to get it :cursed_flushed:
I don’t even know how much it is but I’m broke too
I don’t even have that lmaoo

i like to pretend like I don't know it
damn, how do you even live without costco
The answer is u don’t
Sarah doesn’t exist
it won't let me asterix properly
Z[REDACTED], OH
bc costco doesn’t exist
too much work
thats a fate worse than death
do you want me to post the address of my nearest costco
y'all need to closer costcos
i mean, the HQ is close
Lol buy a franchise n never open it
sarah we need to take u to a costco sometime, its not right to not have one
essencially if u need stuff
but u need a membership to buy
um i dont know exact numbers but i think its ranges from like 50-100
College cities suck at having actual supermarkets nearby I’m p sure case is similar
there was a constantinos in uc but it closed
~20 mins drive
damn you had that ready to go
it's 20 bc my drive is 25 and i'm farther
I guess the idea is is that u don’t need to buy bulk
they do be pricy tho
sarah, u just havent experienced the greatness that is
what could you possibly want at the mall that isn't at costco?
i guess so howdy
which is sad, but i think its probably due to rona me thinks
we want a shirt
i thought constantinos closed
Yea we just need a friend w a car and we can do weekly/biweekly trips
i might bring my car idk i’m debating
idk if you need a car tbh
i won’t use it around campus but i wanna take ppl on adventures
yeah 🤷🏻‍♀️ idk if you need it in the fall
ohio has lost lands
so there are handouts
no need to buy pricy stuff..
stupid me doesn't read what comes next
i'm overseas
dunno if they could ship to the address i gave them
i thought it was an emoji i couldn’t see smh i’m dumb
Idk how they will do it with covid
Today my family sat outside with our cousins 6 feet apart
oh right
i didn't see that text
||sorry, it's 3 am||
depends if i can get a flight though
once u get here tho, might be harder to leave
cuz 'merica is #1 in everything
i don't have visa issues, so it should be easier
*it could've tho*
Our president says if we test less we will not have it as bad
ooo laptop gonna die
cya!
It’s hilarious but I don’t want to send it in the server
rip beth's autocorrect, it only wants jokes
And I didn’t realize until noon the next day
rip
atleast u didnt send something to the wrong person
thats the worst
oh god that’s the worst
So it’s not bad
+/- a  few who arent going to case or sneaking spies
It’s supposed to be 1000
*and w/ the new system, they wont leave instantly :P*
*uh oh*

we need to get those numbers up
i would never lie to you

Oh gosh shots fired
how hard is it to not call me a crackhead sarah
can’t believe adam and i have beef rn
Leave her alone Adam

You can’t be mean
She’s not in our fam yet
Sarah isn’t my honorary little yet
Adam want to be my big
Sarah needs her big/little gifts
what’s that supposed to mean adam
no he gets a lego to step on smh my head
that's even worse, you literally brag about annoying your big
I will re-create "Don't fuck with cats" except I will use gromit dolls instead of cats
Bye Adam
bye beth
Sorry madre
*well that went through the whole range*
When aren’t we crackheads
Yeah if we’re not something is wrong
y'all went off tho
Lee needs a haircut

dw
i suck
You don’t howdy
Omg
Wrong

i wish qq
But he isn’t on
She isn’t coming to CWRU in the fall
shes trying to run
She did tho
damn
Idk it rained a lot
I am going to miss it tho
Who wants to go to gas USA with me
Who wants to get shot
every city has some sketch places tho
i b too scared to go anywhere at 3 am
like i know i’m an adult but i feel like a cop will still pull me over and tell me it’s past my bedtime
They actually never died
dont be a fool, stay in school or u'll end up like me one day you see
Jenin is killing me at chess
I haven’t played chess in years
But basically lost
Well my plans ended early
Now I am bored
oooo
same here
i got back to it a couple of weeks ago
i didn't knowww
mayhaps, but i will be forced to leave when hamilton starts back up
Sorry
also
bad mic
I think they’re down to half their stash so I might be able to outlast them
i didn't like the constant load screens tho
it was probably so more computers can run them without lagging
it needs that time to load
which im thankful for cause im playing on a laptop
im in gmod rn but i wish
like i said, valve doesnt make bad games, they just dont make em often
half life episode 2 tho
and then once they have the engine, they are like, damn, why dont we just make some fun games w/ this
smh, neel do u dont see popups
i dont have popups on my gaming setup
I use a 1280 by 720 screen so the real estate isn’t much
Nah I’m using a rlly old gaming laptop that I’ve had since I began gaming
Win 8, 8 Gb ddr3 clocked at around 1000 MHz ram, 3rd gen Intel i7 quadcore 2.2ghz (overclocked to 3.2 on all 4), 750 shitty sata hard drive, external ssd for my games, and an Intel hd 4000
I have a separate computer with a Radeon pro and oct core if I want to play more demanding titles, but this setup is my original and plays most games well
Integrated graphics on the shitty computer?
But like it can’t run doom complete or the new tomb raider
So I got a better laptop that’s my main laptop for that
It ran bad on PS3 tho
So we can’t count that
well thats cuz u shouldnt use chrome
Internet explorer wouldn’t even load lol
DONT
oh shi--
We are admins tho
you have died from dissin' terry
Don't you diss my boy terry
I'll fuck you up
Will you though?
bob is too busy trying to get enought money from us he can buy his 2nd private plane
He has no need of money from us mere mortals
He merely needs to think about it and it is done
Oh no .. poor potatoes
and i think she left it a bit long
Oh no
why did that need deleting
cuz i was going to say something but then forgot
oh robertttt
neel, i dont think u get one since its about dorming a stuff
neel is commuting tho, so he doesnt need to know about dorm stuff
Cuz I got nothin
i got an email saying commuters have to show up monday for 2 hours
but honestly imma just store stuff in my car or my house bc i dont want to have to remember the combo to another combo lock in my life
more likely my car bc it's closer to campus than the lockers
i wish
oof i forgot about that pass cost thats pricy
to be fair it's the lot closest to campus
the ones farther away were like $300 and $100
i'm not walking 20 mins everytime from my car to campus
cuz i'd lose financial aid if i commute
so i cant exaclty lose that :P
it's sooo close to where all my classes r
Isn’t that for all four years
I think I lose aid too
i don't have to renew my pass bc im commuting
They reduced the amount u lose a year ago
But it’s still a lot of money
Also I already bought plane tickets
why dont u get a parking pass
and live in ur car
i'd need a car first
except u howdy
oh
But you still lose money
rip gaming laptop. i've been playing for 4 hours and the temp is 94 degrees C
there is so much dust in it rip
no i didn't but this specific laptop has a dust trap in the bottom that lets u see the dust buildup
but i would need to open my computer up to clean it
rip the thermal paste tho
Clean it! @stuckinohiolads
i can't without completely dissassembling my whole computer 😦
The name is familiar but I don't personally know them. Truth be told I've only taken one econ class at Case so far. Had ap credit for micro and macro, and Im taking my last two for my minor this fall.
Trust me, as someone who lives with a CS academic
Being a software engineer and having social skills aren't mutually exclusive
It could be nerdier tho, it could be RF engineering
Who knew that waves and shit could be so complicated
they do be waves tho
And you're like wtf is this
well shit this isn’t good
well people still go to campus just not in person classes
Well damn
Lol they still want room n board $$
hold up... if everything goes online should we like... push our classes with labs back a semester
idk there are pros and cons to it
At least for nursing I didn’t have a choice bc it just comes with the general nursing class
nurses don’t really have a choice
At the airport omw! Be in the US in like 24 hours :)
I probs wont be in cleveland til school haha
c u soon tho bud
Yea im self quarantining dw though theres no rule
man i wish had a vault to stay in like fallout 4
oh no
who ever is gonna decide when r we gonna travel
pls select a date where i will be able to move houses and reach uni
so i don't know when my flight is gonna be
but it's supposed to be within these 2 weeks
i don't have a visa problem
Thankfully
be wary tho
dw tho
they will still make u pay the tution in full
oh dw
i'm a citizen
unis
pls don't go fully online
for the sake of these poor students
and are not changing tuition in any way even though students will not get the full experience
ik they "need" the money
but
it's not fair
as soon as you say dont, im going to do it
also mods, @willkaon is gonna need that spy role
are dorming choices over yet
wtf are u doing here
i don’t think they are quite yet adam
Ppl r upset
Cuz they didn’t get a room

wonder how many people dont have rooms
RIP
damn

howdy wtf were u doin at 3 am
But closed now right?
You can leave
They don't even know what to do w it

Rutgers was the big one that ppl are upset abt being online only but makes sense I guess
I hope it happens too I miss it ♥️
lmao we broke into one of the houses on the university farm

Poor house
Broken and afraid
nah the house was ancient asf, cobwebs and antique shit everywhere
Oh sick!!! I love their zoo/park
Do uk a school called Frisch?
Prolly wts her last naame
XD im from nyc tho
So idk too much about the area
Oh neat!
Red is the house (owned by CWRU) and blue is the main farm and greenhouse and shit. I need to find the photo lol
damn that house really be in the middle of nothing
Poor house
My phone is good howdy it’ll last till the end of the day
the fact colleges are still trying to get me to apply to them
My school used to be next to a bunch of cornfields. But then they built houses
No joke I live in the suburbs but if I drive 20 minutes north I’m on farmland
Driving to Iowa I honestly spent a whole day driving threw only cornfields
what's sad is i never finished the tomb raider before this one
Wink implies there are eyes that aren’t being closed at the same time but that’s not possible for a cyclops
i mean the definition of blink is "shut and open the EYES quickly."
wink: an act of closing and opening ONE EYE quickly, typically as a signal.
sorry to clown u like this 😔😔😔😔

I don’t use emotes that much Lol
i’m... too lazy to get computer

places u wouldnt really expect to be
okay yes howdy im not saying the company isn't here. i'm just saying one variety of the franchise that carries my fav burger isn't in cleveland
correct and it's more popular on the west coast sadly
mainly demand tho ngl
its still mickey d's tho
hopefully they dont cancel it tho
Holy shit
I want a chicken sandwich now
I want my chicken sandwich
They want people to be able to do it in person I guess looking at their website
*pri.exe has stopped responding, kill task y/n*
I don’t know what to say
I don’t keep up with a lot of stuff. It sucks
a shame that Ohio doesn't have whataburger
I don’t each much junk
I saw a notification somewhere from y'all about the quarantining. It is 2 weeks of self monitoring before you reach campus and then actual testing when you get on campus. You also have to sign up for a move in time ( sad for us people who fly as that is unpredicatble). If you are COVID positive or been in contact with someone, you are moved to designated housing and housing staff will provide you meals and stuff untill you are better.
yes
sad for us people who fly
I have all my stuff in storage lockers so I need to find a friend who is willing to drive me and transport all of my stuff. 2nd+ years do have a long window though.
isnt good o have a range :thonk:
yeah I feel like freshmen since there is less of you and it is more hectic they wanted to get it over fast.
oh my
i can't aim for any time yet :Angryhaha:
greek life doesn’t suck. men do
True mostly men due to culture
Always a buddy system and don't trust anyone.
doesn’t say the problem is all of greek life
Need advice
I don’t plan on joining a sorority anyway I’ve heard way too much negative things about them. Not just sexual assault but people can be so manipulative and controlling
I am not saying all are bad just there are enough to be a major issue and the complicity built into the current proceedings.
wut no they don’t control you it’s just like strict no hazing policies and stuff
there are some frats that arent bad. dont avoid them altogether
if u dont want to
u dont have to be
AT ANOTHER COLLEGE
they don’t for me meg
Oh well that’s not bad
🤷🏻‍♀️ some are some aren’t
Yeah i've heard a lot of bad stuff about greek life from my dad
He went to a state university tho
i've heard a lot of bad stuff about greek life from everywhere
i wouldnt say completely shun greek life if uve heard bad stuff about it bc i think the majority of greek life at case is decently welcoming and fun (especially rushing for frats bc u get a shit ton of free stuff), but if u know for a fact that it isnt for u then its whatever. u dont have to rush to have a social life
i definitely think its a lot worse at public universities
But still no matter the school the stories horrify me
I go to the parties and vibe sober because I show up too late to get drinks unless some friends can hook me up
Wtf is a zbt?
Yeah i'm gonna just go ahead avoid that shit
At first I couldn't wrap my head around all this frat stuff because I thought CWRU was full of nerds :GWbruhLemonJoy:
also cos i saw the lgbt stuff for greek life and I don't wanna deal w that
Bruh I just read 2 stories and I’m scarred. I thought this doesn’t happen much at a college like cwru but man was I wrong
> Bruh I just read 2 stories and I’m scarred. I thought this doesn’t happen much at a college like cwru but man was I wrong
@sprinkles2108 fucking same bro
MY MOM DOESNT WANT ME TO LEAVE
I mean I love my parents and I’ll miss them a lot but I also wanna have some independence
WTF
ngl - i've already been dealing with creepers in our year
@sprinkles2108 frrrr nothing like the lack of freedom 😩
I’ve dealt with one simp but he wasn’t sexual at all. Just straight up a creep
so u wont have to deal w being pressured into rushing zbt
Girls can’t choose sororities?
> I’ve dealt with one simp but he wasn’t sexual at all. Just straight up a creep
@sprinkles2108 I still don't understand the simp mentality
omg nooo @sprinkles2108
Sounds like an asshole that needs to be punched
mood meg. i was scared af
> @sprinkles2108 my english teacher was sexually harassing me for most of senior year
@lookingforthegoldenlight even the teachers are in on this shit
no mag its not a mood bc u did rush and u did get picked???? how is that a mood???
i’m happy i got in but i was scared
aww
i remember I was in middle school once, and went to pick up my brother at the elementary school
Because men are so immature omg
FIND ME A DECENT MAN WHO’LL TREAT ME RESPECTFULLY
THATS ALL I WANT
BUT APPARENTLY ITS TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR
Take it slow and eventually you will find a nice guy
rishta auntie heard u, she's gonna grant ur wishes @sprinkles2108
It’s hard to find people in my caste kinda
The abcd population of my caste isn’t too prominent
i've never met anyone who was kshatriya
yeah my parents are super casteist though
My last name doesn’t give it away though
I didn't expect to hear the caste system being brought up
My parents aren’t as casteist anymore
which is so stupid
oh, so its a system of racism
It’s a class system
but i don't like my parents' version of Hinduism if that makes sense
Like I pray when I need to
before finals 👀 @sprinkles2108
er isn't hinduium a choose-ur-own religion tho
"we need to follow this very strict version of hinduism and if you don't, then you're a sinner and inferior"
Well my parents are like don’t disrespect god and Hinduism and that’s it
oh and not to mention
Oh yeah if I’m on my period my mom doesn’t  let me near our shrine
they claim hinduism hates gay ppl
My parents just let me do my own thing except for buying metal t shirts.
yeah, i don't go near the shrine out of respect
I KNOW WTF IS UP WITH THAT
I tried to ask my dad why
> Oh yeah if I’m on my period my mom doesn’t  let me near our shrine
@sprinkles2108 that's just....
Wtf
But woi tho
well, i think that's because women didn't have anything to collect the blood
so they didn't want blood near holy places
I love my religion but I don’t go overboard
If I get a nose bleed can I go to the temple?
> If I get a nose bleed can I go to the temple?
@Deleted User  yes you can’t bleed out of your you know what though
don't let the cat bleed in a temple
I hate lying
Don't we all
Dang so it wasn't just blood it was just female blood from the utuerus
I feel like karma is gonna get me bad if I don’t tell her
Not gonna lie Padma I cried to my mom out of anxiety last night because I’m leaving home
I’m that soft at heart
awwww
Sometimes they aren’t
Yeah, see, my parents aren't rational
Like his family in general is more liberal but still strict
so, the way i deal w my parents for this stuff is that i can't expect to treat them as rational people, b/c they'll come up with all sorts of stuff to keep me at home
and end up spiraling with their arguments
sry if i'm being kinda blunt, rude, or scary here @sprinkles2108
But they’re still strict in their ways
like, i managed to convince them to let me go to case b/c i told them it would give them bragging rights, scholarship money = cheaper, and that it was a good school for premed - they were dead set on sending me to a state school instead
My mom was like GO TO OSU because I live near it
osu be suc tho
> osu be suc tho
@howdy_.  I don’t like OSU don’t worry
I’m such a strong believer in karma you don’t know
but honestly, if u say or do smth rn, and they're in a bad mood
> @howdy_. lol they always write OSU so pretentiously like THE Ohio State University
@chandachan  I hate it when people put “tOSU” in their bios
then it'll work against u if u wanna be on campus
> but honestly, if u say or do smth rn, and they're in a bad mood
@lookingforthegoldenlight  for sure. But my dad wants me to go to campus
my mom's been on abt how she wishes i stayed at home lol
She still doesn’t want me to go
Since i'm going to be leaving soon
awww
imagine having parents that don’t wanna get rid of you
mine are waiting for the day i leave
Awww:(
awww
Rip
I’m sorry:(
rip
lmao chinese parents be like once you 18 you leave the door
u don't like heer, prease don't come bak
We went to go get my passport made today and they were like parents don’t need to sign your form you’re 18 and my mom was so bummed
damn that hits hard
awww
No joke when I was 9 or 10 she REALLY wanted to have another kid
i kinda wish my parents were more liberal
awww rly
Oh same
my parents don't do that thankfully
And if it’s turned off my dad questions me hardcore
but i'm scared to let them have access to my phone
b/c they go through it without my permission
See I have nothing to hide
and my mom saw that and instantly thought i was trying to seduce him
even though i was trying to explain what it meant in that context lol
@sprinkles2108 oooh in a good or bad way
awww
that's still kinda nice tho
btw - sry if i'm killing the convo for everyone else
@sprinkles2108 awww - meanwhile my brother shuts himself off from that kinda stuff
No joke if I talk about any guy and it’s not related to school my parents tease me
awwww
I want guy friends
I haven’t thought about marrying any of them calm down
not ed sheeran omg 💀
I wanna meet a guy in college but can’t do that as pre med!
Wtf...
NOW IDK IF SHE WAS UNFIT
BUT SHE STILL “MARRIED” A TREE
Ugh
UGH
Marrying a tree tho....
It would be so hard to get over him
breakups are hard,
I got over him after a year and a half
That has a shirt and programs from the last concert we were supposed to have
awwww
aww
tik tok bad
@stuckinohiolads yeah i ended up deleting tiktok
Neel last time you sent your home screen you redownloaded tik tok :thonk:
Oh
I hate tik tok now
no after india banned it and they record like ur clipboard and shit, i had enough of that charli damelio hype house crap
oh
i never will understand the ppl thirsting over him
I don’t know how people find him attractive
he looks like he took one too many bong rips
Hunnn I respect you for keeping it from your parents for that long
I’m too emotionally weak to hide it from my parents
I need to put my parents on an info diet
i don’t mean to sound angry and i certainly don’t wanna be “the person w problematic parents”
but yeah, that happened
@sprinkles2108 LOL idk either
and hate everyone and everything
I tried to hide my thing, but after 2 months it was too much for me
As long as it wasn’t physical
We never hung out
Only talked online even though we lived 10 minutes away from each other
and then “Ohhh i wouldn’t have heard it if it wasn’t true.” *glares at me*
Oh my😳
and then “But dw! U can trust me! I won’t tell anyone!”
ok the last time i told her smth it went right to my dad and he started being pass agg too
It’s ok if you don’t want to
ah... idk if he’d be ok w that
@stuckinohiolads also apparently the US is considering banning tiktok?
aww
I don’t know
idt he will tho :\
Cle isn’t bad though
just that he's worried abt international students
Personally I'm thinking about telling them that I cannot do e-learning b/c i really get distracted and can't study properly at home
really?
like it wasn't as consistent overall
the only annoying thing though is that
or people barging in during zoom lessons and trying to talk to you
so that's not rly good if i'm trying to study for a test
or trying to learn smth in class
oh man howdy and jenin and i spent probably 45 minutes talking about the kinds of chips we liked the other day....
I also think BBQ chips are kinda hit and miss
but then they make my mouth hurt
that’ll fix it
Yogurt? Really?
Oh
I didn’t know that
or when ur tongue hurts after eating pineapple?
Oh yeahhhh
my mum always gave us yogurt for whenever our mouths hurt
I don’t know I rarely had those experiences
So I never resorted to yogurt for that
Oh agreed 100%
every flavor basically except pistachio bc that one can choke
okay maybe i’ve never had it
How can it slap so hard
how have i never seen it
matcha don't even slap though
I’ve never had it
Please don’t eat me
I can’t right now it’s 11:25
WHEN EVERYTHING IS CLOSED??
Smh my head
I don’t even know a place in my area that could have it
Shaking my head my head
Shaking my smh my head
Or something I never watched dbz
u cant tell me im wrong
Bro I got so much chaotic energy rn you don’t even know
oh, i have to show u all how to square up once rona is gone
And never why is the square up
For my tea drinkers can i get an F. I can't find my loose leaf filter 😭
How many of u guys are still going on campus
I’m really worried about the bathrooms— especially showers😣
im not too worried abt anything just the showers
i think i'm just wearing my mask unless i'm 100% alone or eating
we need to have lotion too
i've got no skin left
schedules are annoying tho like it’s hard to plan ahead of time showers @mag3is
im prepared for that 3am shower, 100% alone then
they proposed like 10 changes u should have the email tho
Is it the one from 4 hours ago?
oh its bureaucracy, i guess its unavoidable
they claim they have power but they really don’t tbh
Nothing like getting into your bed all clean and tired and then pass out for the night😌
I rarely take morning showers. Only I’m REALLY groggy and need to wake up
yeah when you did an all-nighter and need to wake up
new people!! i know discord is confusing but if you haven’t stopped by #deleted-channel (click on the hashtag) then please do so🥺 we want to get to know more about you!!
status update: still too hot
its not working qq
that shit would slap ngl
the flow chart of how far the links have gone across the internet

When you missed the vc earlier bc you were stuffing your face with cake 🧿✌🏻🧿
rip
Apparently it’s good
Damn it
I have beef with bezos rip
I mostly abandon the hype trains I miss
OMG
I MET SOMEONE WHO DOESNT CARE
OR DIDNT BOTHER
Yea I just never caught on I guess
I spent my preteens nose deep in kid spy novels
Apparently we no longer stan JK Rowling because she’s transphobic
But ppl are debating if she’s racist or nah based on the content of hp?? Idk what’s going on in that fandom
Service provider then
Oh
service provider 🙈
Dunno how tho
cuz they have actual infatruscture
Oh dang
Japan’s technology though
Omg
Water instead of toilet paper
Oh
it would probs take a while getting used to getting ass blasted everytime u shit
No joke though
And so people can’t afford it
And when toilet paper ran out months ago in the US
Bidets were sold like crazy when tp sold out
damn
Feel like there were worse things to worry abt tho
ngl when i had water squirting up my anus, it made me feel uncomfortable
i screamed the first time it happened
i wasn't ready
my body wasn't ready
where will one shit then
> my body wasn't ready
@stuckinohiolads  “SHE WASNT READYYYYYYY”
y'all need to read/watch some
i thought skynet didn't take over ppl tho
What I think sci-fi is doesn’t match up with how most ppl show it
shit
Oh gosh there’s 3 of them
Fair
I still live in the timeline where Disney hasn’t bought marvel
aw poop
Rip tho
RIP 😦
at least disney hasn't ruined ESPN
the only reason they arent a monopoly is cuz they keep changing what being a monopoly means and litterly straddling the line
i don't watch a too whole lot of disney tbh
i don't watch espn unless there's a big game, i only watch like some marvel movies, and i can't say i like many pixar movies
guess what disney owns
You can’t escape Disney unless u go to YouTube maybe and that’s a whole nother thing
FUCK
disney has gone tooooo far
their magazine isn't
OH SHIT
fuck
imsorrygoofy when tho
That hits too hard
SHOOT I DIDNT INTEND THAT LMAOOO
I got three shots yesterday and I can’t meeska mooska move my arms someone entertain me
That was me on Monday and Tuesday
Oh dang
Yeah I was carrot eboy but it fell out of style and I suspected lol
Carrots do be dangerous tho
ur too sweet ima cry 🥺🥺
Ahaha don’t cry secksy
I haven’t had a real conversation on here in a hot minute
I have no piercings (tho I want some) and I think I’ve put my tiktok days behind me
Same I was obsessed for 2 weeks
ima get some piercings with u when we’re in college brandon
I was obsessed for a few months
Still tryna find him
K just trying to put names to faces
the fin aid dept is terrible
Crying
work 😔
My thumbs work genius
rip sarah
Makes sense tho, my friends and I think there’s a correlation between intelligence and mental illness
(thnx for reminding me i forgot)
i have bad vision
the reason nerds are stereotyped w/ glasses is cuz their brain puts more into brainpower and less into rendering
I never show my forehead
also make sure to grab some roles cuz u can tell by julia's pfp she hasnt 🕵️ 'd on anyone lately
I can't manage to send invite links
this is such a meme. the ohio science fair ppl sent me a dvd of a pdf
I don't understand why they didn't just email it me but felt the need to send a dvd and waste shipping, production etc
thats what they want u to think
no it is, i already tried my dvd ripping software
I guess you have a shiney frisbee then
i found the price tag on the box, and since the company that hosted the science fair sponsored it, we got it free
if you're feeling real cheeky upload a copy to the internet archive if there isnt one already
it's still copyrighted tho 😦
i don't want anymore legal trouble
i already got an ISP notice for pirating
someone isnt using a vpn
but they thought my internet pattern was weird
i don't go over 250 gb a month
but i used over 1000 in a week
omg
idk i use DSL internet with like 3 mbps so i'm happy with what i have
to be fair the cd says it was made in 2003 so i don't blame them
and they just are still getting rid of them
too mean i’m sorry adam 😔
*in the other corner we have sarah, who seems to be the crowd's fav*
Alright, i want a clean fight, if you punch below the belt, only one of u would be hurt, so yea, have fun with that
Sarah can't hurt me
adam still says he's invulnerable while being beat up
once sarah tried to drive all the way to illinois to punch roman
Wow not even real facts Adam I can’t believe
i can’t be one of those cool nursing people
more like, doctor of horrible roasts
sarah is going to need the whole burn ward after this roast
Wow bobs crying again this is so sad
Sarahhhhh you don’t wanna get rescinded
bob can go away nicely 😡😡😡
That felt like what I think happens happens when you leave all the Pokémon’s together in the Pokédex
fair
Rip
i didn't say that
Can’t data collect now the data’s all corrupted
call me an idiot, but I actually can't find the rules channel here
I can’t either!
ayy you suck
Which is sad to hear
esp since we haven’t posted on the reddit in a hot min
still a small sample size tho
I think probs the people who joined earlier got thru reddit
Making them from scratch was so much I’m never doing that again
Even worse
This is bad
All of these are bad
Whoo Rain!
*im sorry i dont speak* 🍝
iPhone>>>>
pri, u kno how i feel bout apple "products"
Ok but can you have emulators and the Google Pixel's camera app and be able to install apps outside the app store and set default apps for everything?
And replace your entire OS if you want?
daven, charge ur phone tho
No but at least I don’t have a 2002 camera
camera are like the least decive thing about the phone
Actually my phone is my main camera
You can’t
i just use my phone for texting and some social media and games. i want a phone that i know can do it's job and do it well. thus, apple
I only got an iPhone because people who send green bubbles in iMessage are treated as second class citizens
pri, ur camera arguement is gone, this dude actually takes photos
Ok but the trash Androids are awful with photos
wouldnt it be a shameif you couldnt customize or upgrade your phone
androids arent a brand
For me iPhone is soooo much easier to use
oh wow i cant read lmao
i mean maybe i dont want choices
i want a tight concise inventory to choose from, from 1 seller
it's a phone
it's not a computer
i didn't say i liked disney
it works but ur wrong
I’m not wrong
since i use my phone for communication, iphone and apple products excel at it.
thus why i will never use an android
iPhone is more user-friendly
Not games though
T-MOBILE IS GOOD WTF
which make androids suck
im talking about ur OS communication sucks
service providers
the android texting app sucks
iPhone processing is better
which doesnt make sense
why do you need a mf choice to text your mom
cuz
if i want every time when she calls me to put my phone in all black
cuz y not
But other than that iPhone>>>>
says the 1k+ phone vs the $100
There’s a reason why androids are cheaper
Cuz they suck
There are more low-cost Androids because different manufacturers have the freedom to produce simple dirt-cheap phones for people who don’t need that much
i mean this debate is nothing new
Ngl I used to be a hardcore Android fanboy but I've grown to see that the debate is entirely stupid
Yet you still said Apple isn’t better
Personally I use Android because I'm a power user and want a phone that I can have as much control over as possible with crazy specs to boot
iPhone takes around 10% worldwide
Because only Apple runs iPhone
Android tablets are dead
That's fair, however comparing a OnePlus to a Samsung is a bit like comparing an iPhone to a Pixel
You can't really say that Android isn't consistent because it's different between Huawei and the Pixel
sorry
You also don't have to live with a company's take on Android if your phone has an unlockable bootloader
but aren't phones, like phones?
People lose interest in you if you use an android (from a dating perspective)
the thing is out of the box android is shit compared to apple
Snapchat is largely responsible for the "Android has bad cameras" notion, as well as SMS
You can't install an api
Snapchat implements Apple's Camera2 API equivalent on iOS
But not Camera2 on Android
and gain more money
at the end of the day it boils down to money
Snapchat is just a terrible app on general on both platforms tbh
> Snapchat is just a terrible app on general on both platforms tbh
@syberkonda  uh no it’s fine
i'm using snap on my old iphone 7 and it runs fast
No I just mean the design and function of the app is terrible no matter what
dont tell me
I don't need that in the For You tab
Well yeah I don’t go to the discover page
cuz i will lul
Snapchat doesn't just show you unnecessary content
uh i mean it's only if you want to look for it
She isn't
i use it to snap ppl and view stories. i don't see whoever that is
The For You section needs to die
I don’t pay attention to the celeb stories that show up
I never watch the discover stuff
dont get neel started on dark mode
nope
He admitted he can’t read
i couldn't care if my phone needed an antenna. as long as it looks not like a brick, can text and do communication stuff without complaining, fits in my pocket and has a great battery life, i'll use it. oh and yes social media.
NOPE NO LONGER A DEBATE
i dont wanna talk about this
DAVEN SORRY BUD BUT YOURE LATE
CASE CLOSED WEEKS AGO
I’m not about to lose brain cells over this
simply wrong
I’m sorry🥺
Isn't every day simultaneously a weekday and a weekend day at the same time
People still work and stuff
Quarantine sucks
I meant by work
But I also work on the weekends
Where do you work
Well we just opened last week. And with covid things are slowwww
I’m getting paid to do nothing
that's the dream though right?
as long as it's not too boring
Well my co-worker and I don’t talk much
I’m training two people tomorrow and apparently they’re in college and tight friends so I hope they’re more enthusiastic
i work at a quilt shop so basically everyone else there is several decades older than me
do u have discounts on yarn tho
well no yarn doesn't normally go on quilts
that bad huh
tetanus bad
hurts so bad
and then no more moving
I am pro vax but anti ouch
ron be like, the only way i know i'm alive is if i feel pain
existance is pain ()_()
What if ron enjoys the pain tho?
Unfortunately not a masochist
ron u like pain
Hate it
Would murder pain if I could
alright he hates things
One of the worst random pains of my life was going to percussion class after getting a shot
trying to keep the bow of your violin up 👀
while having a shot is bad too
that sounds worse
It’s usually a race to last of who wants to take the bells so I take initiative and my muscle memory outran my brain lol
It’s funny bc the reason I never did marching band was because it would cause me too much pain
Yet here I am even in classical bands in pain
u must like pain
Does anyone know if we will get a refund if we are forced to leave campus dorms due to an outbreak in the middle of the semester
I would counter with: if there was an outbreak would we even be allowed to leave?
They seem pretty confident in quarantining those who are positive so I feel like unless it’s half the undergrad population falling at the same time they would tell us to chill out
Now if it’s the state of Ohio or city of cle idk
I do miss percussion tho
Despite the pain
Not a masochist however, even tho it sorta seems that way
now we need an air singer and a name
Dang you haven’t seen avatar tho
Couldn’t b me
Bassists don’t feel pain. I wonder why!
Oh
oh to be a viola
Idk why everyone does violin bc the viola sounds so much better
I would’ve rather played the cello but I didn’t know better as a 9 y/o
esp on the e string it’s satisfying and idk why
u don’t have the small hand perks neel smh
i wish i had piano player hands
Idk if my hands are smol but they have stretch
maybe i just need the stretch then ron
i can’t reach an octave on the piano i feel like that’s a problem
Oh no so smol
Oh man I forgot there’s sizes for violins lol
when i bought mine in 5th grade apparently i didn’t either
And if my hubby doesn’t like it then we’ll have to compromise and start early
We played stupid games
Yea drums are a great instrument bc you can learn basics without need melodies
i can barely play rhythms idk how u percussion ppl do it
Ugh rhythms are so fun
never did moosic here
Oh we don’t sight read for auditions
ron... how do u play the same rhythm over and over and not lose ur place
Sight reading for percussion is a solo and not an actual ensemble part so it’s never actually accurate of what we’ll be doing so I do hate it
Most of the time I do it off of feeling lol
Oh man
I do hate played snare tho I’m never fast enough
how do they move arms so fast wtf
Omg what are some of them
It’s sorta the basic roll your wrists clockwise and anti clockwise up and down left and right 10 times
I’ve always wanted to learn how to play the harp
man if only girls would stop playing my feelings tho :/
Aw
I never play anyone
Because I ain’t a bitch!!
Fave technique is bowing vibraphone tho
People play me though😌 guess I’m a toy!
I don’t have time to play
Honestly though I don’t understand the concept of playing someone
Shit my wording was off
Playing someone is awful
You have to be really cruel to do that
I still don’t get why people play
Like you lead someone on
And then I feel so bad about it
No need to feel bad that’s just a personality thing
Because I can be clueless if someone likes me
Confessing is too much work don’t understand why people do it
This is why sometimes I’m too scared to get into a relationship. Because I fear that with my personality I’ll get used and then I’ll be cheated on
And I’m one who takes these things seriously
Or you’re stuck in a relationship that’s one sided which is worse
I’d feel like a clown if that happens to me
And apparently finding someone loyal AND caring is harder these days
Rip
I’d like to think my friend group is both loyal and caring so I don’t think it’s that bad
I never joined any school gcs for that reason
Except for the one girl who started everything
I never had friends IN school
Most of them were outside of school
Never really I should say
In elementary school I had like no friends even though I tried to make some but being one of two Indians in my grade it was hard
I never went to any diverse schools lol
Can’t run into racism if I never leave my demographic 🤔
Except Indians shit on their own culture
It’s so bad
I don’t even know why
But some aren’t
Ugh
My parents hate Nigeria as a country and as a government but culturally they’re mostly with it
I’m the only one who wasn’t born in Nigeria lol
I don’t know who they are
Yeah I don’t know many in my area
Oh Oop
Damn you left out Houston
So I almost never go to southern states
Damn u guys have family reunions and shit
couldnt be me
When over half the fam is in the states there’s no choice or the grandparents will be upset they can’t keep tabs on us
My ultra-conservative grandparents are in India so they can’t comment on me unless they’re visiting😌
damn
I never met my paternal grandmother but I was SO close with my paternal grandfather
One child policy and my parents moving to the us before I was born mean I barely even know my relatives in China
There was that period where my parents were disappointed in me from like 8th grade to 12th grade where they refused to let my relatives talk to me either so that didn’t help lmao
Omg
Parents do b disappointed 70% of the time tho
i’m sorry albert 🥺🥺
Like seriously when do our parents ever compliment us
It’s fucking sad
Aw man gifted class did mess me up tho
No studying skills
I can never live up to the 2 year old me who knew every state capital
Now I can’t read
Made us study so hard for why
No one even made me I just did shit on my own
My sister wasn’t born yet so I just studied
Don’t remember any of it tho
Couldn’t be me
Gifted was just a test you took in kindergarten so it meant nothing
I feel so stupid now
I’m a woman I can’t believe they expect me to know how to read
Turning off my brain to read was so much work at the beginning but at least quarantine gave me time to try and get back into it
reading, not anymore
i wish i knew how to read
Aw the Pizza Hut deals
Miss those
I don’t even proofread my own essays
I never recheck my answers
sages is gonna suck
Cuz I’m a dumbass
Oh
She linear tho
but dog
Dog
OMG

no here eat this hot dog
rip
i've nver actually taken it
Rice snacks tho
OMG THOSE
but they make me sleepy
is this good or bad
the test was dumb tho
like it was asking me if i danced too close to someone
like wtf
I’ve taken it before
i did something wrong
damn boy wtf you be doing
IDK that's the thing
during cross country one of the traditions during senior year was to hotbox a school bus on the way to a meet so i sadly partook in that cuz i was a captain
but other than that nothing
Vaping seems like too much
but i mean like i did it ONCE but bc of that i am apparently "less pure" altho i haven't and won't ever do those again
i'm allergic to nicotine apparently lol
idk
Just don’t methinks but peer pressure b rough
Damn neel rly be wildin
Breakin laws and shit
i didn't break the law
don't have insta
i'm not thoooo i hate drugs
I made an insta acc bc all my friends did but never used it
I deleted snapchat because it hurt my confidence
snapchat is the worst social media change my mind
Idk how you’re even supposed to Snapchat
i wont sarah, cuz u right
Don’t do streaks
Insta worst social media lol
imagine having hair, couldnt be me
I’ll never stop saying it
Really want to buzz it off
He isn’t even going to case
Howdy doesn’t even exist
If that’s your thing howdy you do you idk
Got it’s ups and downs tho

CUZ CLIFFORD
Doesn’t that make you go all🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
All my homies hate courage
I feel like that one tiktok where it’s like scary scary
I’m laughing so hard
I love taking selfies but moving the camera so you get that blurry effect
Wtf who came in my Apple juice
I feel like I’ve asked this before
it do be like that tho
i dont think so
I’m feeling self conscious
i like how i've never actually simped before
That’s 42 on the purity test tho
doesn't mean i simp
neel we kno ur last name tho :thonk:
shit
damn that quesedilla tho
who doesnt like quesedillas tho
As a dairy hater I can’t
I don’t think we have space

Not to be indie but if I don’t get to a coffee shop asap I’m going to implode
Live that college dream

cuz shes not rly sarah
I’ll never change my pfp this is how I want to b known
Isn’t that from a ghibli movie?
Rip
Rip I never got to watch all of them
damn
i need to rewatch those
My sister would like to guess kikis delivery service
How old is she tho
uh oh
Wow I can’t believe ur overlooking me like this
Lol sorry I don’t know much about you
Fair lol I don’t give much up
Really?
sorry ron lmao
i just realized the thing in ron's pfp is a stick figure
i got it wrong at first too i thin
I made a fb post in the group but it was months ago so a lot of ppl here don’t know
I did put any pronouns tho
cuz hes the supermo simpo
Fair lol
Keep howdy tho
ngl like i've considered thinking of myself as non binary but i don't think i feel that way enough to want to change my pronouns or anything
honestly what even is gender tho fr
like at what point do they just become stereotypes and shit
idk i never really even considered anything like that until i met someone who was non binary
i feel like labels just kinda don’t matter
Unless you want them to
It just ain’t a big deal
who gives a shit
except howdy
Need a psych major in here
I got a 5 on the psych AP exam
good shit
I do not vibe with my parents for that reason
Don’t be afraid of me for being non conforming Brandon and no I don’t have a dick
I’m still Christian just not the same sect as I was
There’s soooo many sects for religion
I’ve turned to nihilism as religion which does create a paradox but none of it matters anyway
idk i dont rule out a god
but i dont rly believe in one either
i just dont know shit basically
He died on the cross 😔 for our sins 😔
i mean the reasoning behind religious ppl is that we don't know what god is doing right, and he has his reasons
Ye that it happens for a reason and stuff but in the moment it may not seem like it
idk i don't believe that shit
back then if someone has a vision
they get sent to the mental hospital
Omg some people consider the religion I grew up in a cult
I feel like people are all there for different reasons. Some want a community, others want to forgive themselves and fix their lives, some just need the structure
the kool aid killing ppl
because people need to think that what happens in their lives has a reason
it makes people feel a lot better when something bad happens to them and they can excuse it as god
I lowkey want to research that religion but I feel like I will b Sad
religion is sad
i don't hate gays 😦
the only ppl i hate r ppl who r mean to me
My parents gave up on churches bc they hate tithes and having to tie money to religion
But they miss the community
honestly that's why i still tolerate my religion
my parents are both atheists so they didnt raise me religious
still trying w/ my bother tho
I told my mom I’m not Christian she was the big sad but got over it
Like i don't believe creation stories bc im a science person but i believe in something or the other doing some voo doo shit to make my life hell
and like i don't buy the whole gay ppl bad shit
it's sad how ppl try to force their religion on others
And I don’t force it upon anyone
We aren’t supposed to be discussing controversial topics in the general chat😳
The thought of bordering on breaking a rule makes me feel very bad
rules are made to be broken
> The thought of bordering on breaking a rule makes me feel very bad
@enby_barb  I’m the same way
There was a pole taken from 80000 Americans
Don’t judge me
lmao pole just looks so wrong im sorry

now i no longer wanna jerk off
Rip
Never had boba
A horrible thought
moving on
oh noes
This went all types of bad let’s go back to religion
I WILL DUMP BOBA INTO YOUR THROAT
Rip to the rest of us
cuz i think theres tea without caffeine
caffine do taste bad tbh
I don’t go for caffeine bc it makes me buzz
Hair is so much work
brandon do be killing it w his hair tho
I can’t do middle part just twin puffs

Oh lort

Real cavemen don’t speak only gronk

looks like a damn meth lab :GWbruhLemonJoy:
We do be paying 15k for no air conditioning
and it has to be a real med issue, i tried scamming my way to one
is it comfortable without AC ?
i thought cleveland was cold
nose bleed and heat exhaustion (essentially i cannot function if i get too hot)
Smh my head
i ate too many taquitos
Rip
i didnt know that was possible
bro when i tell you the covid test hurt like a bitchhh
Not sure abt the hurt part but it felt like if you got water up ur nose
i wish that’s what it felt like
5 inch swab up the nose was not fun
Nah water up ur nose sucksss
It’s like a regular flu test, right? super uncomfortable for a second or two but after, it’s done
What’s a flu test
both nostrils? That’s dumb, only need to do one
A flu test is the same test. We just didn’t test for the coronavirus before
just dont have allergies
Are they testing everyone when we get to campus? I can’t remember if they said that
I haven’t been tested😳
Isn’t the blood test quicker tho??
it depends how how much case wants to spend on us (hint, nothing)
But for shots I don’t know why I just naturally look away
Also I would probs need to know phlebotomy as a nurse so I’ll get a mini head start
i follows em's quote of provax anti ouch
its gonna be funny getting the test tho
cuz unless i magically have no signs but im carring it, i've been quarantined for about 4 months
Has anyone’s navigator given them feedback yet?
I’m getting a bit worried cuz I haven’t heard anything
nope
huh they really haven’t said anything yet omg
she took 2 weeks to respond to a simple email
still waiting here
but tbh i don't have any questions cuz ik my schedule is good
like idk what she could possibly say
"no you can't take this class"
just something so scheduling can happen
arent most classes like 3 creds
cuz 5x3=15
aren't most 4
He recommended me to take math 125 instead of 126 even though I got credit for 121 and 122 and can easily take 126
Nope
🤦‍♂️ it won’t take you to the pdf
idk how much work 19 would be tbh
yeah still blank 😦
wellmy navigator sent feedback on june 23rd, and i couldnt see it unless i was in incognito, but i just checked it now and it shows up in a normal browser
my navigator prolly didn't do it bc i talked to other ppl w/h my navigator
i mean i didn't say anything negative, just that she's slow with emails
I haven’t heard from my navigator either
she’s my navigator too and i haven’t heard word from her yet
I didn’t get an email but my navigator left feedback on the page like 3 days ago
exaclty, i dont have a printer, and im not gonna pay case to use theirs
printer ink is expensive tho
My tour guide didn’t tell us about a fee lol
so you dont put coins in
but u still have to pay
And mentioned nothing about cost
Oh ?
u should be able to get around it
yea we need boycottin
I’d rather just drive home print it out then drive back
That’s how they make their money back thru that 100% need they do
I’m playing please no one do that I would feel so terrible
i dont know thier pricing
u need a lib card tho
Already so one cle natives needs to take initiative
couldnt be me
rip
and for the record, I am a firm believer that if an engineering major doesnt like a printer setup, they should build their own
I’d rather pay someone to use their printer than pay case so if anyone needs that for motivation
that’s the only reason i wanted a mini fridge with a freezer
if anyone without a freezer wants to store their ice cream lmk
Or did covid cut them all off
I don’t plan on bringing much with me bc packing everything up to leave at thanksgiving seems like such a chore
i dont think he got the response he was looking for
I’m still mad about the printers, but are we actually gonna have to turn in paper copies of stuff in 2020 THIS DAY AND AGE
its v sad
I don’t know why all these unis don’t have a fully functional online submission system it saves literally everyone time
My hs didn’t have that but we still turned in everything online and it was just a mess
Even with my last semester and everything online it was much easier to keep track of everything through fucking Google Classroom
How have colleges not copied the formula yet??
pcm do be gr8 memes tho
I went here to get a feel of washing my clothes during college
Even the ones at Harvard are broken and they have the most endowment of any college in the US
Oh
I wash my clothes during the day as I found out if you let your clothes sit in the washing machine or dryer overnight, they start smelling weird and you have to rewash them unless you don’t care abt the smell
I know it’s a meme but I don’t want it to go unnoticed
Now I have that song stuck in my head
rip
when you have smol brain, songs dont get stuck, its a simple solution but quite impenetrable
i guess it
dont tell me what to do
rip
rip me
idk
I wish the bot kept track, but mee will not inherit the earth
Why do doctors have bad handwriting :thonk:
and/or premed do you have bad handwriting or will it eventually become doctor level as you progress
yup, say goodbye to ur handwriting
I think my handwriting is trash already so I’m wondering if it’ll become worse 😳
we need proofs
that says we need ac in dorms
If you all want to see a grand memeshup (meme mashup) I just made, mentally prepare yourselves, then head to the meme channel

we can only hope tho
but there is a shop like 5min walk away so its not that far
oh yikes
my money is on english
Oh I was thinking the opposite, like those who don’t have to write much for their major had the best handwriting
theatre seems likely
cuz even on the tech side, we mostly use our hands
actors tho
:XMARK6: **-W3E-Kakashi**, you can't use that.
:XMARK6: **-W3E-Kakashi**, you can't use that.

:XMARK6: **n e e L**, you can't use that.
Bad bot
mee: bad human
:XMARK6: **Priyanka**, you can't use that.
Don’t tell me what I can and cannot do
@MEE6 you bad
Companies don’t pay well
Except
You can’t
Because we’re in college
I really need to see if people in cle are hiring
a lot of my friends went the tutor route but it always seems like the qualifications to become a tutor are increasingly higher
And completed math through Calc 2
yall b lame
Ffp can suck a dick and balls
I'm so sad
They hate everything besides newsies
So don’t blame em
the history of the entire world i guess > hamilton
Ok I just skipped a few minutes and I’m bored
i’m **sleepy**
i almost forgot to log into my internship, so that really sets the mood for the day
I have 2-3 massive Clifford stuffed animals I forgot abt lmao
You know you want to 😉
You don’t have to change your pfp
*pics or it didnt happen*
Because unlike toddlers, Clifford isn’t annoying
Hold on I’m slow
in other non baby blending ways, i broke quarentine to go to costco
the 4th state of matter that someone grapes can get for some reason
nothing really is matter
well doesnt liquid glass flow
Even if we learn his real name it doesn’t matter he’s forever Howdy
Oh shi--
I’ve given up on my navigator getting back to me
I just got mine now that you mentioned it Esther
I have “I want to break free” by queen stuck in my head
doesn't exist on the internet
and school and all that shit
oh wao
im trying to get him to sell me waffles
Don’t use tiktok
I stopped using tiktok
But still
imma need your ID sir
um wtf @sprinkles2108
Like telling what happened
also i hate when ppl get political for likes?
Independent parties do b practically useless tho
but don’t use it for likes :/
sry if i seem kinda rude w that
which will push the major parties to go more left
that’s just my opinion tho
Nah dems won’t move
Too many ppl aren’t willing
that's why even the trump campaign has a hard time attacking his policies
shannon dont kill me ily
im honestly just want to see Biden's ticketmate
It doesn’t make a difference but I like Tammy
idk i havent checked the list in awhile
i suck at names ngl
I think she’s too far left of him
lost a leg or something
pretty sure biden will have to pick someone relatively left of his own policies to appeal to any of the younger voters
But who though
He wants a woman
I wish he could
i feel like it shouldnt be too hard for biden to find someone left than him
oh noice
i miss going to pride in korea
I don't think he'll pick someone that far to the left of him
He already went way more left than he was before he ran( he's actually pretty far to left of Clinton) so doubt hed want to pick someone even more left but who knows
I mean he’s already looking at runners left of him for the voters who wanted Bernie
left is relative
so it shouldnt be hard for him to find someone thats relatively more left
time isnt real
oh
Honestly idk enough about it he just gota pic someone who well apeal to ppls in mich Penn and Florida cause those are the only stayed that really matter
Nah it’s the Bernie ppl who are willing to not vote/vote independent that he needs
Nope
Heard it wasn’t that good
i hate that i cant spoil it
i tried to watch it
wasnt that good imo
Tbf I haven’t watched it but I probably will when I have the chance
the last i watched was 11, havent tried 12
yeah series 11 is kinda boring i agree with that
rtd era tho
cos i feel like moffat wasnt that great lol
Yuh he sucks but, good stuff sometimes
tho i heard about the ||timeless child|| and i was a bit confused
whittaker hasnt said she's dropping yet so
at least another season with her
idk how i feel about having three companions cause keeping up with all of them has made it crowded tbh
i still
need explanations
i've heard rumors they're only keeping Yasmin for the new series but idk
eccelston wont
cuz he lwft on bad terms
since he started being more open over the last year
and he really likes Whittaker's doctor apparently so MAYYYBE
i think i died a little when eccleston ran into matt smith and peter capaldi at film con last year
i definitely died
All those crossovers we want but don’t get
I never bought the comics but I saw them
i want to rewatch dr who but it’s not on any streaming platforms 😡😡😔
It’s so hard to find legally
I remember when it used to be on pbs rip
i miss that can we bring that back
i hate that its been like 10 years crushing on this man
@mootdoot but same tho
(technically step-son but still)
It was my motivating factor in trying to watch her series from the beginning
i feel like he didn’t age well tho @hjk_2468
didnt donna say that
sorry i like white skinny boys it do be like that
just don’t go after the nic addicts
bruh fish sticks and custard is so gross matt smith suffered filming that apparently
i thought they didn’t actually give him fish sticks
RTD just went wild
LOL i realized and then didn’t wanna go down that route @spacemanboris
Aw man if dw was rated r I wouldn’t be able to keep watching
the only reason the doctor gets away from full-on torture on screen is cause its a family drama
torchwood made me hate Capt Jack
isn’t cap jack bi or smth
NO, you didn't offend me. I know you mistyped, don't worry.
honestly i just want to see Chibnall and RTD gang up on Moffat cause they've been lowkey salting Moffat for awhile
I haven;t
i havent
although david tennant plays a complete a**hole in it but still
i need to watch daredevil
Yea marvels shows (except iron fist) have been p good
go into the corner of hell reserved for terrible comic to screen renditions
rip
and the main character in jessica jones was in breaking bad
u hate to see it
I dislike the flash tho
Really??
"infinitly delaying due to rona"
rip
meh i feel like it went down in quality after the 1st season
i still need my Hawkeye drama too
Yea I don’t plan on watching any new marvel movies not in the theater, u lose some of the magic
im assumeing you want to know what happened in budapest?
EVERYONE wants to know what happened in budapest
i dont get it
LOL i have math puns
its worse than my corn puns
i’ve tried my best to integrate em with respect to the conversation at hand
They’ll never get him right
Ig i’m diverging from the topic tho
dead in the water
math
The math puns
how does that work
rip Sarah
u cant'
Or maybe he was and they hate Hawkeye lol
ngl i want them to replace him not just cause of whats been said but because he's getting too old for the role lol
I know there was something else going around the internet regarding him but 😳😳
i dont even get the reasoning for that comics AND mcu-wise
Guess they thought the dead accuracy he has wasn’t cool enough
dude like comics Clint Barton almost became Capt America and he turned it down like
The. Most. Annoying. Thing
probs for live action they dont cuz the actor didnt agree to it in contract
oh my god 😭 the fact that they disregarded that in the movies is horrible to me
they tried to make him not-deaf like three different times
if they included that, it gives deaf kids a role model or something idk🥺🥺
I mean even if they make him not deaf, they can explain away with hearing aids
I feel like there’s minimal disability representation in the media and including that detail would’ve been HUGE
dude comics writers really tried to get away with it by saying "he has small hearing aids that you cant see because Iron Man" and i lost it
Yeah so so far, from the latest comics update, Clint Barton WAS deaf due to child abuse then he got it fixed before the recent series, where he gets a head injury that makes him deaf once again
Aw man now I’m gna read it
im still mad Jeremy Renner said Kate Bishop is "female Hawkeye" i hate that
my Clinton Francis Barton would *NEVER*
Got the whole thing passed on to her
idk how but please
she hasnt been introduced on-screen but they will with the upcoming Hawkeye drama
He lost his family and went emo
if you didnt know the context
u figure, he lost family
and went nuts
i lost my family so i'll randomly kill gangs while dressed in culturally appropriative attire
no doesnt make sense
honestly comics Wanda is just ruined everywhere but still
the killing joke adaptation tho
Yea I didn’t wanna read it bc they said it was annoyingly complicated but I managed to read thru hydra cap so
honestly House of M was a bunch of writers sayign what if we could kill all the characters we want without repercussions
I got thru hydra cap, the first civil war, and the 16010-616 incursion so honestly I feel like house of m wouldn’t do much to me now
Scarlet witch does have some crazy power that should be talked about more, but I don’t think the killing of all the heroes is a way to go abt it
I don’t remember which comic I was reading but they were having a debate over needed her help but half of them didn’t want her bc of house of m, so they really did ruin her with that
cuz
yeah i gave up on trying to keep up with comics wanda
idk im not familiar w capt marvel comics
Oh yea same I was just saying that they messed her up with civil war 2 and I don’t think her character has recovered yet
Rlly for no reason but rip women ig
i cant believe some ppl just sit there, read that, and go, this is fine! print it!
wtf
Ur missing out
tho the thing that made be kinda stop reading dc comics for a while was a teen titas comic
if i want porn, porn hub is -> way
i do still likecomics
Didn’t Spider-Man kill Mary Jane with his radioactive jizz
they wanted kids, but instead got cancer
Who comes up w this shit
Goddamn imagine ur fetish be killing women through ur sperm
thats some nasty shit
on the other hand there are fetishes where ppl want poop on em, so at this point, im not surprised
I'm not if y'all know but Grant imahara is dead. You may know him as one of the cohosts from mythbusters
Why are so many celebs dying this year
My favorite music composer ennio morricone died too
Fuck
as if this year couldn't get any shittier
why is using broken glass as an art medium incredibly nerve-wrecking
bc im making a mirror out of harddrive disks
lots of computer gore here oop
Computer gore would be worse for me if I could actually identify parts but I’m just like :0 pretty colors
wtf
advisor notes in journey i dont see it guys pls help a poor soul
my navigator didnt say anything
because if they didn’t then they probably didn’t get to you yet
I need to actually check my journey and shit
Yea I’m waiting til the end of the week, if I don’t get anything I’ll email or schedule a meeting
I have yet to see if mine added notes
But I don’t know if he added notes on myjourney
He suggested I take math 126 instead of 125 even tho I got credit for 121 and 122
Yet he suggested I take 125
Because I got credit from the AP exam
But he wants you to take 125?
i’m taking 125🥰 😩can’t do math gang wya
I think the only math I have to take is a statistics class junior year
The rest of my math is remembering conversions
except u guys really be having those other hard classes
If I don’t think about them they don’t exist ✨
me pretending organic chemistry doesn’t exist
goodbye julia you will be missed

Yeah I haven’t voted yet
I didn’t know registering to vote was also registering for the draft
Your primary and state isn’t together? Or am I trippin
they didn't delay it
Cuz I was supposed to vote in it
Wtf
Rip
Yea it sucks that the draft is forced
I mean tbh I’m not nervous anymore bc of corona
Don’t remember which channel this was in, but some news on the printer situation. It seems from a Case website page that we are allotted $20 worth of printing as undergraduate students before we have to pay
Aw noice

Man I haven’t checked twitter in forever
I only started using it bc I was tired of twitter
I got Reddit for college apps🤪

Even though I’m not 😭
applying to college
Applying to college

Bruh I always felt so stupid
i went viral on showerthoughts once
You’ll never find it though
I think you really missed out Aidan 😳
it’s not too late to drop out of college...
Exactly you haven’t paid yet
dropping out of high school is so much more chad than dropping out of college though
oh fair fair
Missed that chance rip
But will I get a school fee refund??
I don’t wanna remember my high school
If I’m returning the diploma I want all 4 years of money back
isnt there a dog rating one

raspberry and strawberries tho
and blue raspberry isnt a real fruit :p
All blue raspberry sucks
I cant think of a blue indego or violet fruit
isnt that a vegeteble
I guess so?
alright, so thats purple gone
fuck it regardless of the eggplant's feasibility as a vegetable, I dare say it serves as an excellent phallic object
we need indigo
I feel like indigo and purple are close enough that we can use eggplant for both
isnt that a clothing place
we were supposed to have an 8:30 class
its all i had last year
miss me w that
its cuz they want you to suffer
they are letting u kno the pain u are in more
oh idk
it seems so abritrary like why would they shift it by only 30 mins
how r ur clinicals (idk what they're called) going to work w/h this stuff
also dont think theyre placing anyone where covid patients are so
sorry i went and checked the receipts... seems as though i was the last person to text u..... funny how that works. . .,, .

You are a man of many alts
im still the same howdy as before
*im not half the man i used to be*
Hey you never told me when we wanted to do that intelligence meeting
Except I didn’t give out my Facebook
I’m the only Priyanka in this class
I don’t even know why I have it
i mean, i didnt know priyanka was a name till i met u
Is useful in college from what I hear
so i dont think its a v common name
Oh dang
It wasn’t. But now it’s becoming more common
Oh no
Except all the Priyanka’s are shadowed by Priyanka Chopra
who doesn’t?
Then I learned that you're not supposed to do that
Bruh Reddit is supposed to be anonymous
couldnt be me
Discord isn't really social media tho
SOMEONE MAKE THAT MEME

I’m dragging my body to campus 😩
I’m excavating a dead meme and doing fortnite dances to campus 😎 take that losers
bad julia
Bruh how can you find anything if you can’t find yourself

Anyone need an iclicker
I haven’t used those since middle school wtf 😭
i feel like those should have been replaced by some app by now
do I need one
do i need it
cuz i already looked at their website and doesnt seems to be useful
wow, it's almost like the privatized education industry is full of scumbags whose only goal is to rip off poor students...
sorry, I'm just very salty about my AP exams
the fact that it wasn't retweeted 8,000 times stresses me out
i was gonna say ill go retweet it for you buy i saw that it was tweeted in 2019 n im no longer willing to do it
It’s fucking sad this has become such a partisan issue
"I guess we'll never know" -merica

Jk that doesn’t exist sadly
:XMARK6: **-W3E-Kakashi**, you can't use that.
well a class i had in my shopping cart is now closed
and there dont seem to be any more of the same class
it was a media stunt, nothing more
more attention, more money
I don't think he needed to fabricate any kind of campaign stunt in order to be in the limelight again, he hasn't in the least faded out of mainstream media
if you arent doing something wacky or crazy the tabloids will not feed on you and you dont get as much talking time
and everyone lost it
big boost to media coverage, and now he's done something similar, got the result he wanted and peace'd
well kid your reason is just as plausible as mine, so we'll leave it up to kanye to reveal why he announced his candidacy in the first place
so whats getting closed
idk what this.. means
welp, looks like the parties fighting has stopped any actual precaustion
I guess my source was wrong lol
what he does next will be due to how people react
honestly idk why masks would be an argument
cuz, "muh freeeeeeeeeedom"
yeah dam i wish there was a way
Anybody want to go to Norway with me?
Like to never come back
europe closed borders w/ us

Who wants to vc and game tonight?
jackbox is fun, but you need someone to have them first
Aw @beth9746 you showed up on my insta feed

There will never be more people
It is only ever lonely Clark that sits in here, waiting for someone to pop by and cure his boredom
Oh my gosh
oh really im from kiev too
oh cool!! it’s been awhile so I don’t think I have any family there anymore 😔
awww
it was asking for a lvl 400 class
he also told me to enroll in chem 106 which i dont think is offered in the fall?
because I personally like mine, but I know that that’s not the case for everyone and that *really* sucks
Because he was being racist apparently
oh damn i wasn't aware of that
damn racists
Really?
Oh shit
I don’t know
I talked to him before, he did seem edgy
what if he never left
"I am sorry for being the way I was. I never meant to make y'all uncomfortable, or to make the racist comment that I did. However, even though that is the case, what I said was said. I know that I made many people feel awkward, uncomfortable, didn't make the best jokes, and overall created a very bad picture of what a human can be, and I take full responsibility for that; and ye can think of me in whatever negative picture ye want to. I just hope that y'all can live happy, healthy, and enjoy the times that ye have together.
If we meet in person at Case, whatever the circumstances may be, I just want y'all to know that I am not the terrible man that I make myself seem, and I can be very thoughtful, caring, and an overall nice guy; I just have a really hard time formulating my words; I do have a very sour sense of humour; and I try to work on those, though that effort never really seems to work out as ye have witnessed. With that noted, that is all I have to say. 
For the record, I do not want pity bestowed upon my soul, because I am wrong for the things that I did and there is no denying that; but I would at least like for y'all to have in yer minds, whatever it is or whenever it may be, that I will try my utmost best at treating ye with respect, dignity, and hospitality. Thank y'all for understanding my part and taking the time to read/listen to this gigantic prompt that I wrote, and I hope that y'all have a pleasant evening. I wish the best upon yer future endeavours, and I hope that whatever or whoever ye want to be becomes a reality, and that life may treat ye with good opportunities, the warmth of people's hearts, and good health. I know that all sounds cheesy, but I truly mean it and do not want to make enemies with anyone. All the best, Shane Gerber"
also, if you’re feeling bored, feel free to join the vc and play games with us🥺🥺
In summary, pls don’t be racist
Go on mine pled

Her sister was trying to fight her off before the first bite. Her last words were “you wanna piece’a me? 👊”
At first her sister wasn’t even that mad, but then Em dumped cream cheese, butter, and sugar on her. That was the icing on the cake

@sprinkles2108 mandating masks doesn't do jack shit
as someone who lives in a state where it costs $3000 or something crazy like that if you don't
I don't disagree, but I've become skpetical over the difference between pleading and mandating
You’re not wrong
But you can’t insert the key if you don’t have a keyhole in the first place
Beaches and restaurants are open sooo
Because Americans are stupid
They don’t listen
They are. Sadly rona isn’t targeting them (FOR LEGAL REASONS THIS IS A JOKE)
College students in general
Ik CWRU students who think masks don’t work
We aren’t going down and it’s due to a lot of factors
I have a bad feeling Case will too
Ohio isn’t doing well
yea, case is probably going to go to online if things dont improve
Actually they lose a lot of $$
They’re still charging full tuition
Ohio is just going to go up tho
> no they're here to scam you out of ur moneys
@howdy_.  yet students still choose to go soooo I don’t know man
And they’re not testing that many ppl either
well u either lose money now, or lose money later, it sucks either way
i guess
deny all karens trying to fly over
@huynd2001 omg someone who also plays osu
i haven't plug my keys
i have been practicing high bpm stream lately
yea i started out by just farming pp maps but for the past 6 months or so ive been playing 4 min or so maps
mainly streams to get away from farming
yea mb, i just missed on the last stream right before the end
i always 1 miss choke
i can't even aim
i tried tablet for a week and couldnt play with it so i stayed with mouse + keyboard
I broke my mouse playing osu
ima scan it and hack ur computer
microsoft added the qr codes cuz most ppl dont read the stop code
oh noes
i guess im hacked then
why cant i post images
Cloudflare went down
it seems that way
looking at som ddos maps, it seems lower china/india area sent a bigger wave than usual a bit ago

food racism sucks
the difference between who orders and the level of spice really sucks sometimes
Oh

Do you all want to see my melk idea
smhing my head
not that hard to understand smh
Seriously. It’s just a better way to pronounce milk. Don’t know why they have to think everything is gonna be gross
Guess they don’t deserve my idea anyways
albert just cant handle the truth
you dont say melk
even if you dont think it does
will my $0.00 in my bank account i'm sure nothing will stop us
i'll do anything for 2k, now what do i need to do to get monies
Since the gym will be closed, are any girls interested in following workout videos with me? I’m a beginner so no need to be embarrassed about skill level. My favorite is Madfit on YouTube (I find chloe ting stresses intensity more than repetition) but I will take suggestions!
i wish i had the motivation to do it on my own
i was doing morning workouts with my mom but she's gone back to work so i just sleep instead Xd
I will actively participate for 5 minutes, get tired, then go get some snacks
I’ve been doing physical therapy this entire quarantine but I need to start adding actual workouts back to my routine now
I want the boba to echo off my hard abs when I drink it😠
I really wanna be intimidatingly ripped so I can walk alone at night
I considered self defense classes but when they see my sweet biceps after I get Swole all the bad ppl will back off
So I guess in actual workout goals that’ll be deadlifting anywhere between 150-250 pounds
It’s completely unachievable, but the image of me being all upper body and no lower body is hilarious
Never skip leg day guys
That’s so much work tho
I also do boxing for full body tho
i feel like case has everything
and if it doesn’t exist, you can always start a club 👀🙈
shit 😳
Like never got up a day in my life amateur
but falling do suck
I did it regularly and lost 20 kilos over summer
I lost 5 kilos by just Existing I guess
So if I put work into it I could really be out here
doesn’t have to be every week or anything
i wish i was princess bubblegum
Idk characters
what y'all want to be is.... a goofy goober
Cosplayed her three times and never considered it was because were the exact same person
Man I’m knee deep in trying to learn covers on the marimba I can’t add goofy goober
cant be that hard right? *idk i dont knoe moosic*
Then you’ve broken the system
adults dont get to see the inventions often
Is it possible to have freshman 15 at case? I’m looking at the map and even if you didn’t walk everywhere I feel like you’d get a decent workout
i haven’t played my instruments in forever😔😔
Isn't freshman 15 mostly just beer belly
From chugging down a crap ton of beer at parties or something
I need to really watch out on how much I eat
Which i'm kind of worried about
Yea I’m trying to figure out what foods I should buy for my dorm
I would snack constantly but there's never any snacks available
I haven’t stopped eating snacks ever since I arrived in the US
Like if I buy myself a family pack of cookies and fruit snacks for my single lonely self, I will just eat them all in a week
so i guess i have to put some veggies in there
its never not
Gosh do I wanna leave the house to get ice cream? Or should I hold myself back
ron why don’t u just have a stockpile of ice cream on hand
Bc I thought popsicles would be enough
nah popsicles are for sucking, and dont have the power that ice cream has
But I hate most generic grocery flavors
And I still hate dairy
So sometimes I’ll buy ice cream and it spoils bc I don’t want it
true bc sometimes u buy an ice cream container and get bored w the flavor
but then i get the small ones and i always want more
I got really into kryptonite flavor but now I’m tired of it lol
I will never get bored of strawberry flavored haagendazs
I will however go broke from strawberry flavored haagendazs
Man I’m really about to leave my house to get a pint of ice cream
i’ve... never made that connection
Really?
I don’t think it
I tried mint choco as a kid and went bleh this tastes like toothpaste.
huh.... i’ve literally never thought about that before
I could kill for some cherry garcia ben n jerrys rn
Either that or cookie dough flavor
God why am I getting so hungry for ice cream at 1:40 am
cuz
Oh no
rip
that’s so sad jenin😔😔😭
the originals are ok, i prefer the other flavours tho @howdy_.
jenin my dad ate all the ice cream in the house 😭 we’re in the same boat
Oh no juliaaaaaaaa
@sar.hh we used to have dippin dots in elementary school
@jujulb awww i used to chew on cupcake wrappers as a kid 🤦‍♂️
omg frozen jelly stick
I ate henna as a kid
the reason they removed alot of school ice cream was due to the school lunch reform
the food is just as bad, but now its "healthier"
> the food is just as bad, but now its "healthier"
@howdy_. rip
I remember they had eggplant parm sandwiches tho
at my school
couldnt be me
nothing like cutting up food that's meant to be eaten with your hands with a fork and knife b/c clike 99% of ur school is white and u don't want to look uncivilized
Oh
My school gave out a whole variety of meals from different cultures
damn
Kids in our school still complained about the school lunch tho
I do be actually leaving the house to get ice cream tho
Al school lunch is bad
Feels bad man
dont get rona
Bc school is inherently bad
U can buy sandwiches and snacks at school
my classmates did not tho
aww
Not very bad, but they don’t change
she's not that smart either
Sigh
I went to a rich kids international school
I don’t understand why people shit on public schools
My school was korean dominated
so they all ended up eating tgth in the counseling dept's room
like I went to public school, and I’m going to the SAME school as some of you private school people
holy damn
Despite being an "international" school
i had so many opportunities at public school
not even trying to hide it
but that's only b/c he's one of those geniuses that got bored in our public school system
I don’t rlly get the appeal of private schools, aren’t you just paying more for the same stuff
like if u have the money and wanna go then go for it but idk why ppl always tryna say public school is so much worse 😔
Our school sucked
since its tax deductable
They automatically assume the worst, and idk I like to think I’m relatively smart 😭 like I’m just as smart as the private school kids
right idk why they get so much hype😩
i did put a lighter under it and they didnt burn all thay much
10 mins
The moms in my school are just genuinely horrible
even the moms in my public school
that entitlement carries down into the kids tho
And like all the lower hierarchy moms suck up to the upper hierarchy mkms
making the rona problem worse
they'll email the spanish teacher like "oH i'M soRrY tO bOtHeRr yOU BuT i WAs WoNDerINg WhY mY bILLY gOT a B+ iN spAniSh??? cOUld YoU PleAsE exPlAiN, i Don'T undErStAnd"
if it wasn't, he'd be having a C
nope
when the kids shouldn't have been getting it
Reminds me of my school's rival school
Our rival school was even worse
but since the fam was rich
there was nothing teachers could do
Oh, also i'mma just say - i'm so glad i'm not in my hs anymore b/c senior year i was getting sexually harassed by my english teacher
Every kid that went to the rival school has their grades artificially inflated to an A-
padma holy shit I know!!! they’re either going to the hamptons or LBI 😭😭
Awww Padma:((
omg padma 🥺🥺🥺🥺 I’m so sorry 😭
but they literally did nothing?
oh
i’m sorry padma🥺🥺 that’s horrible
Don’t be shy @lookingforthegoldenlight, drop his name and school😌
Damn
damn
@howdy_. sounds like someone needs his family jewels cut off
holy fuck
but like we were alone in his office
also like for the first half of the year i dressed like a dude, or just in general didn't wear "feminine" clothes
Padma don’t be shy drop his info😌
@sprinkles2108 LOL girl i'm scared
It's times like these that I wish my friend 3d printed out those brass knuckles for me.
Aw I get it:((
we're you in his class?
I just dropped my stuff off and was like "I NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM"
I really really wanna punch that creep
now you see, when we talk about equal rights, this is why... equal lefts need to be added to that
or being asked to leave
i'm scared now 👀
Use the power of the internet
Girl you left
see, idk if anyone else did
there's a general thing amongst the student body that he was a creep
and like i knew of it, but i didn't wanna judge him based on that alone, like i wanted to interact with him and form my own opinion of him
Wtf
But fucking woi tho
I don't even
My brain just died
like holy fuck
still bad
but don't show that in school
cuz cleveland is the birthplace of superman, so we could tie it in to rl things
oh god, gatsby and his stupid green light
we did too omg
it’s the longer hair
also apparently he's dating a 20-smth yr old
He has never dated anyone above 25
Wtf
There was a graph about his date like. Whenever the girl touched 25 he left her and  started dating a younger one
wtf
and the rich get away w/ anything
"'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' nearly three hours long," he said.

"Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere, and by the end, his date was too old for him."
but who really wants to be on tiktok
for whatever reason i'm on stripper tiktok tho
Charli is ok but she’s not DROP DEAD gorgeous if you know what I mean
Oh gosh
Aw🥺
Oh
u end it w/ "now kith"
cuz if you have a lisp
you cant say it
I don’t have one
Aight imma go to sleep now it's 2:22 am here
cuz est
Aw:(
oh no :c
Getting used to that since lockdown
But my grandma isn’t happy with me sleeping during the day and staying awake at night
cuz no one is trying to combat rona
like why tho
freedom to die i guess
lmao we don't even have that
when its too late
But fat rip
will hold back on buying the fridge til i get there or not
> will hold back on buying the fridge til i get there or not
@mootdoot  same
ye, cuz ppl dont be wearing masks and out celebrating
Ugh
im out here w/ gloves, goggles and masks since im working w/ computers that arebeing sent to kids
Rip nvm Illinois cases went up
rip
man if i had a dollar for every time i saw someone wearing a mask below their nose
doesnt help at all
Some cut holes in their masks🤩🤩
But when they’re 6 ft away it’s down to teach
I personally don’t
Even tho we were over 20 ft apart at all times
Which is why I don’t wear it
rip
I don’t teach
That’s legit jack shit
damn
My coworker got 1.5k for 72 hours
So if you say the wage gap doesn’t exist
i thought if you work over 40h they have to provide benefits
thats why so many places have you work 39.9 hours
I get no benefits so idk
hmm, seems suspect
But this is over 2 weeks
55 hours over 2 weeks
I hope I get more private lessons booked but so far I have been bad at that
isnt that what they're there fore
Yeah they wanted to practice a tik tok
better than nothing i guess
They don’t want to lose freshman
yea, cuz we havent payed them thousands yet
if we gap, they lose more money
And upperclassmen are already almost done and if they transfer may need to take another year to finish
Sages classes don’t transfer and many other colleges have different requirements etc
if ppl leave
they lose money
and since their first priority is money
cuz you know, they need their 17th 100acre house
probs since rona is peaking cuz ppls be stupid
ugh ;c
i'll go insane if i'm stuck at home :c
talk to the idiots who dont believe in masks
I can’t
i've never tasted vanilla
omg it’s horrible 💀💀
but tastes so bad
The brown pod is bad but the flower is even worse
she had to teach julia that life sucks
they dont smell that good
See this is why you go with chocolate. It ain’t deceptive like vanilla
I feel like vanilla is more consistent than chocolate though
I’m sorry to hear that
Why would I want milk in my chocolate
But I’m just saying Priyanka, if I wanted milk and sugar, I can get inhale a tub of whipped cream
If I want extra I can’t get the ones with like pretzels n stuff
That’s too long though
CHC: cold hot chocolate
There’s a form of chocolate in white chocolate too, but I feel like most of us can agree it probably doesn’t deserve a seat
Fair point
White chocolate isn’t?
I can’t say I’ve ever run into a supply problem
Where ever I’ve gone I’ve seen a form of white chocolate
Yes bc there isn’t much of any chocolate in it
It still has a chocolate taste tho
White chocolate has never tasted like even the worst 10% milk chocolate
I mean it still has cocoa but less of it
Don’t do this to me
Idk for me i could blind test chocolate and dark makes me gag, milk is okay but i don't like it, white has always been a go to for me.
I can’t stand milk chocolate regardless of percentage and I hate most dark chocolates under 70% bc they’re too sweet
And bc of the way they package them you never know what % you’re getting
idk i gotta say 85% cocoa is damn good
i mean people who buy hershey's godiva and dove chocolate aren't actually looking for that
That’s so sad
Their truffles don’t but their bars always do
i mean i don't blame them for it; it's marketing genius
But PNC is more convenient I guess
find a credit card company that doesnt give u  crazy intrest rates
I don’t need a card just a checking account
idk
And do 10 transactions with your debit card within 2 months
Yea honestly looking at pnc it doesn’t seem like they want me enough
find someone who gives you stuff
and u dont have to pay them
couldnt be me
Howdy I just opened my checking account nearly 2 weeks ago
Bc they have so many atms on campus
I don’t have a credit card
Really?
but dont ask me, im not a banker
Gotta build from nothing
If you sign kids on to their parents card they can start creating their own credit tho
Because I’m signed onto my mom’s card
I don’t use it much though because I feel guilty for spending my parents’ money
And she couldn’t go
I mean it’s under the hopeful assumption that your child isn’t buying anything that’s like, $200
Oh no the most I prolly spent was $50 in one transaction
The thing is is that a lot of card places need u to have income of some sort, and I have none
This is all vv confusing why does money exist smh
Idk of Bank of America does that but yeah that’s discover
I currently have a Discover, should I get another card as well? There are quite a few places that don't take Discover in my experience, not necessarily Cleveland but just in general. My family has thought about getting me a Skymiles Visa to use where I can't use Discover.
Isn’t visa basically universal?
Indian Flame doesn't take discover
but that's not an issue bc the food sucks
I think we should abolish money and go back to trading
Man I hope case gives us a crash course on this stuff, bc even tho I won’t listen to anything they say about the matter, it would b nice of them
bro wtf people be using my email for lmfao
I don't even know who this person is
Swing the burglars away
Ye, music sorry
It’s storming real bad outside so it’s still super dark so I woke up thinking I slept so hard that I woke up at 11pm
The thunder is really booming
that means im getting a storm tomorrow
not even tomorrow
Like “oh I’m 45 mins out from Chicago” to put it in reference
All musicians hate music
Music playing is actually fun but I hate theory and history
me and my air guitar says otherwise
I don’t think that many people do
But that just takes the basics to make the sheet music, cuz it’s already written
The great thing about percussion tho is that most composers just say fuck it to conventional theories
I wish I could play drums
So bad
Bc theres so many instruments of different sounds they just do what they want lol
It doesn’t even have to be set drums. I just wanna do it
When I started learning 4 mallets that was the worst
i think you need more arms
I can’t rmbr the name of the class but there’s a class for some musicians where you work on rhythms with a part of your body doing something diff
Vv hard
It’s the equivalent of patting ur head and rubbing ur stomach but in time and it’s you’re hands and feet sometimes vocals
Isn’t it weird that there are over 300 people in this group and yet only a handful text
People are working and whatnot
Can’t read that fast
"every machine is a smoke machine if you operate it wrong enough"
I’m a side character who shows up more than he needs to
never be a main character
i find that main characters always end up w/ suck lives
miss me w/ that
i'd be surprised if there isnt a world record for it
holy shit
ugh, its started to rain, but its still 90+, so its just hot water dousing everythin
Hot and humid is the worst combination
Which makes it all the more worse
It’s no longer raining but now we’re at a nice 70
Yesterday felt like 100 it was horrible
why arent the places near me doing this
Even when I went yesterday the line was nearly out the door
Can’t imagine what today looks like even with the rain
damn
seems like it
frick, we were even starting to have a downwards trend
*this really is spanish flu electric boogaloo*
You know it’s bad when Chicago has less daily confirmed cases than you 👀
who dont believe in masks
and/or arent taking any precautions
Hate Karen’s
I wish more companies would do curbside tho
rip
I mean we are worse than Italy was
When we all were like oh shit Italy
but school districts around the country are trying to have in person
cuz they want monies
no need on even showing up
international students tho
big rip
i want to go to campus beth oml
idc if it’s all online i just wanna leave my house
I want leave Illinois
And wisco and Michigan don’t really do it
i just don’t like being back in the closet tbh 😔 it’s annoying
And then b poor for the rest of my life
Said I wasn’t going to go out today but my whole family knows I like driving so I get to play chauffeur for my sister
you need to knock on wood
Sad days
ps5 gonna be a tough tho
you need to invest in stonks
With college?
I won’t see a return on that for at least 5 years after I graduate, and that’s being optimistic lol
Omg
Yea we won’t be getting anywhere for awhile even with an approved vaccine
we better have covid gone by summer smh
Aw man right when I shut down my laptop
It was annoying having to change it everytime I logged in
You no longer have to go the home page(while browsing classes) just to go back
Aw I hated that too
Oh idk that Margaux . I am sorry 🥺
bruh why cant i view my advisor notes
wth i cant view it
working*
nope*
do we need surge protectors
so dont buy anything too crazy rn
the sky has gone dark(ish)
tho w/ rona its bit more diffucult
thats another option, i dont have much experience in that dept, but u could talk with one of the spies
Tbh you don’t really need a bike on campus and Ik a lot of ppl got theirs stolen
The walk isn’t not bad
sigh
i hate to tell you this
I don’t wanna miss out on the whole ‘freshman experience’ but idt it’s going to be the same obviously ://
you either are oncampus
but i could be wrong, case isnt exacly being the most helpful
Yeah unfortunately
I read the Provost's email as "if you don't want to live in NE Ohio and you don't want to take any classes this semester," then term withdrawal/defer. Otherwise if you don't want to stay in NE Ohio and you **do** want to take classes you should take remote classes (but you're still enrolled and everything)
They aren't being the clearest unfortunately
probably going if cases are able to slow down
lmao cases are not going to slow down anytime soon
Smh I really wanted to come to campus:((
Who wants to chat?
I don’t want to ping tho
As I understand, u can pay thru casecash when ur away from the dining hall
If you don’t then it might be useful
I’m sorry u were blasted at with 2 different opinions 😅
i just saw that it's a 1:1 ratio with regular cash and seeing as most college students probably have a debit card
Don't use casecash
just use a credit card instead
cash cash be useless, just keeps ur money trapped inside the case ecosystem
that dog one is scarryyy
:mad:
jenin is trying to make the most of her nitro before it runs out😩
rip
:boo:
I wish I hadn’t check the muted chat
i mean, im surprised they havent posted anything in #cursed-memes🤣 its usually where most of that stuff goes
it didnt work in the normal browser
Rip
it’s already open
Do people who aren’t coming to campus also have to choose?
no you don’t have to raunak
i don’t think it’ll even be an option available for you if you didn’t choose a dorm or anything
Camping was the topmost option though :ThisIsFine:
bugs wont touch u for days
damn
that was my request bc i wanted more space but ended up in a 4 bedroom unit :cursed_flushed:
damn, how do we get acess to those kinds of requests
I’m still considering going off campus :nootslap:
I looked it up, we can apply for apartments 3rd year
i didnt get my acceptance notification until july 1st
i was considering moving off campus but then i was like hmmm if they send us all home for good then ill be stuck with a lease
so i didnt
fair
i dunno why but my jaw keeps dropping when i wear a mask, i dont realize it till its too late
at this point I need to make a list of all the stupid shit I’ve cut my hands on
rip chris
this was my idea so i expect 33% of the cut
33% of 0 is still 0 though
That's cause he hasn't sued yet dummy
You don't know until you try
but my dad got a gallon of it
if anyone wants home
@beth9746 uh oh :c
Too much sugar but otherwise I got no problem with cracking a cold one
I was talking to a prof about it and she said the only way CWRU isn’t having in person school is if dewine says so
> how do none of u drink choccy milk qq
@howdy_.  I used to drink it after exercising when I was younger but not anymore
i don’t think he would bc theyre all so adamant on getting kids back to school
Yeah the spike has to be BAD for them to cancel school
@kaori_flute we don't, it's just too much sugar
tho i don't put milk in my coffee, only my tea
tho i woulda too
I drink water most of the time tho
real gourmet shit
yup, i wish i had hot coco
i will say tho
cuz it was never taken
probably all of the 17th slots be gone
so some of us got it in early
pack the nessesities, cuz we dont know how long we're gonna be here
we're going home after thanksgiving aren't we
when someone gets rona on campus
not what you want
cleaning supplies def
oh 100%
i'm a clean freak anyways so i need a broom and clorox minimum
finding clorox wipes do be hard tho
any sort of cleaning wipes will likely do
ye, most places are sold out round here
just don't mix bleach + ammonia and you should be good
so its still a gamble
I don't believe in genocide
tho apparently piss + bleach can make mustard gas?
cuz if you properly hydrate
tho padma, i just thought, the urinal cakes have bleach in em
and i dont think mustard gas is made that easily
yeah i didn't really believe it when I saw it
like idk, reddit can be scary sometimes
*well they need a banana for scale*
you see, when ur a ghost in the machine, these problems dont happen  nearly as often
tho
they need to be sent to horny jail
Howdy the people who were in that channel last night
Need to be sent to horny jail
Amen it shall no longer grip our conscience
oh dagnabbit
SHAME ON YOU GOOD SIR @howdy_.
i don't know much about biblical mythology
its the og fanfiction tho
what I do know is Hindu mythology, if u ever need that
and there's this myth about a woman that was turned to stone
conveniently left out that she cheated on her husband
like "oh yes, this woman was turned to stone because of a mistake"
my only job in life is to study, cook, clean and get married
Kids are great as long as they aren’t mine
I don’t know?
I've wanted to read the one abt Saraswati, i never knew how she came abt
except there were more animals
and they didnt get eaten
@sprinkles2108 the colouring in some of those stories was wack tho
oh wut
oh wut
children books are terrible when you think about em
most people die
Sleeping Beauty though
Wasn’t that a thing
I didn’t read the original I think
in china tho, right
NO DONT DO THAT
"Phone bad"
b/c every 3 yr old has an iphone or ipad now
or the stupid essay we had to write about sages
"vibrating smart device big bad"
I never thought of that
oh
the little mermaid gets turned into foam, since she broke the deal
I ruined someone childhood by accident cuz I said he’s not a mouse
the early books everyone looks much more animals
arent
the wrong side
oh
Cancerous shit
I got hella responses from aunties tho
mainly shit like
They didn’t shit on me for once:)
nothing ever goes right whenever we tell that auntie about any of our plans
Oh
My parents didn’t really care
My parents are immigrants tho
Nah I’m going to college to waste their money
like literally... my mum was sleeping and had a headache
My parents don’t care about reputation
i had a phase where I didn't wanna do medicine b/c i have some issues with needles
and my dad called me stupid and dumb
boo ur dad
But you just said you didn’t like needles
How much do doctors deal with needles tho?
i mean they should be happy ur scared of needles
tho... again
Or work in acupuncture
my dad has been knocking me on the head abt not praying daily
and saying shit like i'mma fail,
i'm only good for doing bad things
"better yet i'll just drop out of school and be a hairstylist"
i think i did a presenation in 10th grade about how banana peels are about as bad as cocaine
Haristylists b going crazy tho
If you work with natural curly hair that’s some good money
Like how your parents scare you about stuff when you don’t pray and do certain things
it requires a diff cut
Like it’s not thatttt bad
Same but missing it shouldn’t be scary
isnt that why meditations is making the rounds as the next big thing
I pray when I need to
what I DON'T like is when I'm trying to chant Vishnu Sahasranamam and my mom starts criticizing me about my pronounciation
aka finals @sprinkles2108
meanwhile my parents put me in Veda class for 5 years @sprinkles2108
oh wut
i havent done it
@lookingforthegoldenlight I went to Sunday school for a long time too. I learned Hindi and stories from Hinduism
didnt exist
oh lord this tiktok
i can't even light a grill without burning my hand lmao

The 7th day did tho, all prayer n stuff happens on the big 7
some ppl just cant do manual labor smh

Albert will be sad to hear this
albert already knows pacific is bad
and my parents didn't want me going out of the country
not that i minded tho - case was still my top choice so
in a country that doesnt have spiking rona cases
With the hell my family raised of me just going out of state I would’ve never had a chance leaving the country
college pl0x
maybe study there
fair
*i hear they sometimes dont even have borders*
*yes i know, that was bad*
damn
They all think I’ll die without family nearby lol
Which to be fair, they may have a point, I have no brain
my parents didn't want me going oos b/c they didn't want me to end up "bad" like my couusin
he got a 34 on the act tho
aww
aw
I didn’t bother to study I trusted Jesus for the first time in my life
that was me tho @howdy_.
Everyone was telling me “omg if you studied you could’ve gotten a 35” like nah I’m don’t need to be good just enough
you can never escape em
It’s too much work to be attention seeking
thats dont be ugly
dont be unattractive
don't dudes keep growing till they're 20
isn't iv just being injected with like some sugar and salt
and water tho
cuz i grew at like 12

Lightning is scary

The world is scary

Isn’t that about like ppl dying from bombing or something
i wish smelling good things was a cure for disease
Anyone know when Case is supposed to make Office 365 available for students?
what would i do on the weekends tho
they cant stop what they dont see :P
go for whatever u think u need
i dont want to go hungry on the weekends, and i think ill save more money by eating in the dining halls rather than just buying food myself
i didn't even get a meal plan tbh
its college food, so dont expect anything that good
groceries tho
oh frick, i forgot you have like an entire house
:rip:
i think they are going to be closed due to rona
:rip:
im still impressed you managed to get an apartment, i'd assume they'd have you pay an arm and a leg for that
i guess they really are desperate to get that room n boarding
damn
cuz others cant see it
I wish we could just sleep 24/7
Yeah well I forgot rona was a thing for one second at work and I almost gave someone Ik a ball cart f
Now I will be roasted by coworkers for 2 weeks
You don’t need gloves for it
But somehow it’s been 5.5 weeks and no covid
I don’t want to die for them lol

There’s a high chance tho I will get covid unfortunately
Faithful until death is really going to be demonstrated
rip
they aren’t just gonna get rid of greek life
"greek life is gone"
heres hoping
bruh ohio hasn’t required masks til then?
He needs to strictly enforce the mandate
Otherwise these dumb rednecks won’t wear masks
my city and the surrounding cities didn’t have one😩😩
I was wondering why I’ve never heard of the place but there’s only 2 locations in Illinois
Apparently it’s healthier than chipotle and people like it more but I like chipotle more
But I’m at the one near case so idk if it’s just bc it’s near a college campus or nah
Oh yeah, causally drive from Chicago to Cleveland
I live 2 hours from Cleveland and haven’t been there since January
Cuz
Oddly enough I never go out to the suburbs of Chicago but like today, I have decided to drive 10 hours
Nah I took my sister but I was the only one driving rip
I don’t know if my parents would let me drive up to Cleveland jUsT tO eXpLoRe
I don’t think she’s seen case yet
I keep trying to convince my parents to let me take the car to campus so I can just leave whenever but they want me to have a “real college experience”
Lol my dad travels for work now and takes his car and then we’re left with my car and my mom works from home. So if I brought my car to campus she would literally be left with no car during the week
But I don’t know if my parents want me to take the bus lmfao
My parents are apparently fine with public transport which is wild to me
Cleveland not sooo much
I wish we ran on ethanol
oh
I think we did a lab for that in bio and it seems as if ethanol is a bad source for energy compared to traditional fuels
Really??? I learned otherwise in enviro
yeah bc isn't ethanol corrosive to engines
Hey if you run then maybe you can cut the travel time in half and still save money
Funny enough, even as an Ohioan and frequent visitor of Cleveland, I have never been to Bibibop
I have passed by the one on Euclid many times
Sooo many branches of soooo many restaurants
Chipotle>bibibop I don’t make the rules
Even tho bibibop is supposedly healthier but who knows
so can they really be compared
Oh here chipotle is dominant
I don’t know anyone who’s gone to qdoba from my hs lmaoo
This is so sad
so thats why its probs due to the popularity
im not sure if there is a qdoba near campus tho
you know the typical "college fast food"
we aint canadian
probs cuz we close to little italty
close enough
that's only like an hours drive
i dont wnana
well then dont?
also isnt 123 the first one :thonk:
it doesn't look like there's any prereqs so idk why they would email you about that lol
I got that email and I didn't take AP physics or anything so I'm very confused??
i didnt take any aps
There’s no proof in my app that I’m accomplished in physics
i didn't get one
But I suck at calc and physics
idk i took general physics 1 & 2 last year and i didn't get it
maybe it was sent to all class of 2024 by mistake?
oh then probably cause these are freshmen classes?
I got 5 on physics c and calc bc and didn’t get the email so idk
well duh, u clearly need a 6 :P
Ah crap
Its actually a ploy to get the ppl who dont understand physics out of those other classes:)
Couldn’t be me
Damn I really wanna go to cedar point
but its a no go cuz rona
Oh I went last year
(but the tall rollercoaster was closed when I went):(
awww
Sometimes it doesn’t make it all the way through
I never understood why though
i feel like it was just looking at the passage
Anyone upperclassmen took the math 126 exam?
I'm tryna take the place out of it test on August 14 or sum shi. And I'm tryna figure out how the test is gonna be for math 126
Like u can place out of math 126 if u get 70%
I've only seen glimpses of it on twitch though

yeah super lame
well frick, i didnt know that
i still havent tried any
wtf really
Oh I’ve been playing so many games from that bundle
Mostly the light novels tho
i havent opened it yet
i must have missed that one
damn
Yea I’ve been trying to get thru all the light novels I don’t really wanna play actual games yet
wondering
"here's money for it"
idk
i guess so
Oh
What's the dude's name ? The math one everyone's obsessed with
Oh I was asking if anyone's taking the math 126 exam on aug 14
oh aight

and yet
I went to sleep my g
im serious tho, its a easy to tie
One of my friends wanted me to send this in a litserv or newsletter by emailing said newsletter or litserv, however I'm not sure how to go about that. This is the email they wanted me to send:

Due to COVID-19, students and teachers have transitioned to online learning, which may be challenging for many students and particularly those with limited access to additional resources. To address this need, other students and I, in partnership with Humanity First USA, have launched The Education Project as a program to connect volunteer college students and professionals as tutors for elementary, middle, and high school students. Through volunteer online 1 on 1 tutoring, we can help ease the academic burden created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project is currently ongoing this summer and our goal is to serve communities with greater educational needs and continue into the fall. Volunteer as a tutor this summer by signing up at: www.theeduproject.net or recommend those that need K-12 tutoring to register on the site. For more information, feel free to contact info@theeducationproject.net
It doesn't look like the organization pays tutors
*atleast u tried :P*
when i went to the website it was complaining about the certificate not being legit? are y'all trying to make a company cuz if so, ur gonna want to get that fixed
really?
and you can lose out on ppl
so your def gonna want to get that fixed
cuz images do be everywhere
I'm on the Cutter Gang GroupMe tho
dunno
Why don’t you post it in a reddit thing
Neel, how so. Indian aunties dominate that platform and there’s so many of them
Nope Neowise saw me
No its mr clean
are freshmen allowed to register for classes yet
not yet
Just college tingz
im even more convinced its a table
anything is a bed if you try hard enough
@2waynice if you stay home you don’t have to lol
pocket the scholarship money that would pay for the apartment
aww yall should come for orientation though, well miss you:(
Most of orientation is virtual though
well miss clifford:(
NO THOMAS DONT PULL THE CLIFFORD CARD ON ME
staying at home would be a no brainer if i didn't ummm....not wanna be around family anymore
ngl tho i'm kind of freaked out at the idea of living with 3 strangers
at least at home you *know* the people you don't like
my cell be solitary confinement tho
i still havnt met mine:(
ur gonna want to talk to them
That I shouldn’t come
Nah my parents won’t let me rooms alone
isnt that safer?
that seems like
They don’t want me to be alone
They wouldn’t listen though
don't tell them
I don’t lie though
what they dont know cant hurt em:)
being alone in a room
its to deceive them and make them think sth you dont say
To be alone
so that they cant yell at u for lying
and is generally safer in prison to be alone
there's generally no reasoning with indian parents
aw:(
and not where ur supposed to be
Dann Cleveland ain't even that bad
Oh hunny
well, i see why she be worried xD
i doubt cleveland is that bad
I’m not even kidding
about 10min away it gets even more so
it gets worse
lots of campuses are in bad areas
My dad lowkey didn’t want me to go to NYU or Columbia because NYC
i'm still waiting to hear back from vandy's waitlist
so being a college student there
I’m still waiting on Northwestern LMAO
I’m not gonna go though
Too late

go spartans tho
are any of u looking at grad school
I’m looking at med school
how are you already lookng at grd school
i'm gonna start studying for my gre this year
Ill start studying the week before knowing me:(
i mean the advantage of prepping for med school
is we dont have to get into the job market for like 8 more years
ngl if you wanna go to med school u can't start prepping early enough
But then miss rona
Priyanka if we belive hard enoughth well get there:)
rona do be ruining plans tho
miss rona...miss rona
I BELIVE IN CLIFFORD, HE WILL LET ME INTO MED SCHOOL WITHOUT STUDYING
DAMN THOMAS
applied math and environmental studies here
case doesn't have a super strong math dept but oh well
its a research school
math is math
I could not be a math major
Math is meth
my pre calc teacher was like fuck the curriculem and he did his own stuff which was bassicaly college level math
this is gonna sound annoying but math is the most mentally rewarding thing anyone could study
It was the worst year of my life
My Math teacher gave us a one week crashcoarse on electrical engineering with a test at the end...
Ugh so soothing
why the fuck are there so many damm variables
dont remeind me:(
fuck idk g
if you dont have insurance
me want money:(
Because I’m on my parents’ insurance
I don’t have my laptop with me rn
you need insurance to fill out the form
cuz they will need to add u to it
Shit
health is waived in the same area tho
Wtf
youd never be able to fit that couch in your dorm
So stupid
if someone tries to make out with any of my shit i'm just gonna kick their ass, done
charge ur damn phone
i never leave my room how are they gonna steal from me
Wtf
hook 1.21 gigawatts into that bad boy
*bad boi
bad boi tingz
anyway pri, u need health insurance and room insurance
Why do I need it
do u need their health insurance to see a psychiatrist on campus?
yea but why can't i use my insurance
Doctor= prolly need insurance
there's so many things
and case isnt clear in any of them
u don’t need room insurance
idk if i need it bc the apartments are case owned but
Because I won’t lose stuff lol
they can’t force u to get renters
you need an id to get in the gal darn building
you take the class for free without getting credit
Oh
p sure it still shows up on your transcript but just says audit
My intro class is pass fail
welp i didnt even check if my flassses were pass fail
Same but for neuro the intro class is p/f
can't you make any class pass fail
I don’t know
well if you dont get a c
looks bad if you're planning on applying to grad school but probably good if u suck at a certain subject but have to take it
Because I never chose an option
It’s an intro class for my major
i wonder if that was changed due to rona
No longer doing bio
Not anymore
omg
Cuz it wasn’t an official major
Not anymore
NO BORING BIO
It’s lame imo
bio isn't quant enough and it's just very dry
But as pre med that’s hard
idk I preffer it to chem
i hate chem but i'm really good at it
Cuz
It’s a good mix of science AND math
chem is hella math but it's also sooo much conceptual shit
Physics is mostly math
not math > math
i like social sciences too though
Not 101 though
i'm debating if i should add an econ slant to my applied math path
idk i preffered Econ
I never opened my econ textbook
shame
I never did the hw
(before u judge me noboddy in that class did hw)
i opened my econ textbook when i finally got to a concept i didn't understand outright after a lecture
We never had homework in econ
plus we didnt change seats the whole year
idk for me it was satisfying proving that ATC increases when MC crosses it
that just breaks all of math
damn
well, then, i guess u wont know em all
Howdy if we have the same classes we're gonna run this shit
If somebody bitching us out of our seats we're gonna have to drag them the fuck out and that's on everything
cuz
OH
yea, we dont have a :pingsock: or anything like that
Bad
this shit rlly gets me heated
cuz whose gonna stop em
it rlly be making me mad
its making everyone mad, people be dumb and could end up killing people who've done nothing wrong
the same ppl that are like “we need our kids back in school!! i will@not have my kids do online schooling!!” are the exact same ppl who refuse to wear a mask
like u can’t have it both ways
they closed border to us
i wish tho
i've gone out on a canoe b4
cant promise we ont end up in North Korea or sth though
but honestly North Korea might still be safer rn
Because I need to cancel my bill for housing
But idk where to go to cancel it
tho
I don’t know how quickly they’ll reply
maybe shoot them an email now and keep trying to figure it out idk
sometimes they lowkey be rude tho
I gotta find that number tho
calling might work
Their phone doesn’t work apparently
IDK
CUZ ITS ME
I guess
I don’t know
if you want to know the sound
its the only way to fix it
And the agreement isn’t linked to the billing statement
If you don't want to use swift I've been using Flutter recently
The framework compiles to native code so there's no performance hit
If you run the master branch there's desktop and web support too (Though some packages aren't compatible)
better than nothing tho
imagine having an iphone
i don’t understand coding stuff 😳😳
couldnt be me
howdy and i are both windows phone people
Windows Phone 🤮
tho adam, i find that ios dev is much worse than android dev
swift seems easier
i dunno, when we kept trying to get our app published
android java seems easier
it was apple who store who be diffiucult
I haven't actually tried ios because in order to do that you need thousands of dollars to become a dev
they need ur monies
You still need a mac to compile though*
and miss me with that shite
and putting stuff on the apple store is a pain in the ass
Although android does take java/kotlin, there are a bunch of things you need to know that are specific to android that are hella confusing
Fuck macs
All my homies hate macs
Miss me w that shit
I do have an iPhone tho
psst albert u need to take the pc quiz
Which one tho
oh
I already took it
was i blind and didnt see it
Yeah the only ide I can use to write swift on pc costs money so I’m out
Nah I just didn’t send it here
But isn’t the problem with notepad++ that it won’t compile whole projects but only single files? Or has that since been fixed
"computer nerd"
aint that us all :P
So there’s really no difference
i think there are some other school spies here
committed would still work tho
But I don’t think they have the committed role anymore
I don’t know but I’m not coming to campus
Howdy I think that the overall cost of attendance will still remain the same regardless of on-campus and off-campus learning the the omission of room and board fees because your financial aid as determined by FAFSA takes into consideration everything
They can’t charge us for housing if we’re not on campus
but there will not be money coming in from room and board
Yes they won't charge for housing, but if you obtained any aid from FAFSA, that's bound to decrease
They can’t charge us $16k for not being on campus
Oh
They can’t
bob needs his next audi r8
y'all leave my homeboy bob alone 😤
tbh bob seems kinda nice tho
i feel like he'd bake cookies or smth

BUT MY BOSS HASNT PAID ME

ugh
But nope
I don’t want to nag

I can’t insist

u don't want ur parents yelling at u
So I don’t wanna bother her
oh lord
y'all are too scared of ur parents
@howdy_. i'm trying not to get my ass beat man
Wtf
they aim for the spots it hurts the most
my parents don't hit me tho
then why are you scared of a beating then :thonk:
Nahh i cant really relate
until they get mad
I don’t get yelled at. It’s so rare. I just get lectured
ya my parents were mad for hours just b/c i forgot to check the alignment of the planets before selecting a move in slot
ive never gotten lectured:) im to cowwerdly so I run away when they try to lecture me
Sorry that’s too funny
they do be like sima aunty from indian matchmaking tho
@lookingforthegoldenlight I couldn’t get past halfway through the second episod

my mum gets so many matrimonial calls
Oh
Fuck that

your brother clearly wasnt studying hard enougth:)

damn was he not studying enough lmao
nah it's b/c he wasn't praying @neptune234
Wtf
yeah reading textbooks prob wont help with that though
oh shit
@dropavpmen but even if you were taken off the waitlist, you'd still come here right 😉
no i just accepted because i didnt need to write anything extra for it
isn't it a public university ?
but we dont live in mich
yeah but still $$$
But out of state tuition shouldn't be that much
i could've sworn its a state school
it is they basically charge private school tuition for oos students
no no it's not a state school @howdy_.
out of curiosity tho
if y'all didn't choose case, where else do u think u'd have gone for uni
A&m or uc santa barbara depending on how much my parents would be willing to pay
damn
But A&M has a bad rap for being too conservative lol
@neptune234 sorry that's after factoring in my aid
u scared of the "big bad conservatives"
I think i'd have gone to McGill or Carleton
@howdy_. Nah it's that I really don't vibe with their culture
rip
damn
which is fine tho, i didn't really wanna go there anyways
I kinda wanted to go to USC just cause I wanted to go to cali:(
seems to work for USC
i pretty sure im getting rejected form the berkeley waitlist but i wouldnt go if i was accepted anyways because too much money, and they are fully online and still charge full tuition
cwru is a reject school
I promise you a LOCI will help; it certainly won't harm your chances
i wouldnt go if i got in
As I cry about Cornell:(
@howdy_. Fuck that shit it's up to us to change that culture
like the day before an exam just call me over we're gonna get t up
(If your in my class im counting on u Zhanda)
damn im on the 4th
we still gonna t up though
also apperently it was haunted or sth last year
Ignore the last thing she says though
there will be les ppl at storrs, and Since ive only found 22 out of 100 ppl so far...
Maybe some people just didn't bother to connect because I had to reach out to my roommate through email
ON how many ppl ended up in storrs compared to other houses
though there would be slight bias due to the fact ppl in group me and stors
are more likely to want Juniper/Clarke
idk I havnt viseted so I have no clue
Magnolia is shit
Damn juniper on another whole level lmao
Damn 4.5 really
I mean Ive never been inside
Idk if I would describe juniper on a whole other level
you dont get a room till junior year tbh
@howdy_. I understand your atavistic yearning for a return to the stone age where Man lived inside caves of arid conditions and scratched their balls with unkempt fingernails, but please do take into consideration if your fellow humans who have since escaped this dark abyss.
or just went, "far right political compass"
rip the texans tho
damn i think the list is going to be ammended as time goes on
Oh it's for coronavirus cases
Sorry for the groupme repeat. Thought I’d ask here too.
Yeah, idk why but the large lecture for phys 121 is blended

I loved my Chinese teacher she constantly talked shit abt the government
Which really bridges the gap in my miles morales knowledge
i want to read comics for class
i really liked it, quick read but it did make me cry a little
It's an universally acknowledged truth that a crackhead is in want of crack
Awww
Oh n now I got some more comics from my local shop
which comes first HIV or aids i forgot
dang, i wish i had a local comic shop
which doesnt always develop into aids
Howdy plz I need a comic book shop near case
but they closed down
big sad
Online comics is a last resort
If I don’t buy them I get them from the library and if I can’t get them at the library I look online
And meg can I don't mean to flatter you with that, but can I please get the clown gang tag
sages seems like that english class
I'll clean your house
wash your car
that no one wants to take
Topics seem more fun than a basic English 101 tho
heres hoping
Although there was no point in doing community college classes if they didn’t transfer smh
sages arent that bad but id just prefer to not have mandatory writing classes u know
u took college classes in hs
damn
mandatory writing sucks
my final paper is due monday at midnight
i've ranted about that enough already
u dont have to
ye ron, u kno the pain that is that "article"
Can’t talk to others
I'mma technolust someone
zhanda, u dont know the pain
just fat
arent campus groups for classes
Also idk I’m on community.case and I’m looking at the whole list
damn
how could that many people want to work out
i want to shoot some things
there's already a server for it
rip
unless I'm mistaken and I cannot forgo finals because the event is either earleir or later
dont do it
Lollll to be fair I was
i would've died
Omg quidditch
Just googled it isn’t that the volleyball with a trampoline?
I didn’t kno it had a name
are the most annoying jock ppl
but i guess they are just a school
How can I cook when the kitchen suck
cuz they do exist
*not for us tho qq*
They never treat the youth right rip
probs cuz its supposed to be more hush hush
Car club
But now my leg is sore
I couldn’t consistently keep cruise control
rip
I normal just stay 80-90 even though the limit is 75 but the copssssss
I hate driving newer cars for that reason lol
Like I rented a car once where of it notices a car nearby on cruise control it’ll slow down on it’s own
It made me feel like I lost control
I think it’s hard bc I learned to drive with older cars I hate when I drive cars with features that help me lol
cuz what if those helpful features stop working
Never knew that there’s people who don’t know how to parallel park without rear view cameras
tho i agree, u shoudl be able to turn around
My mind plays tricks on me bc I mainly drive an suv but my mom has a soccer mom minivan and even tho it feels different they’re the same length
But like idk what’s gna happen if I ever have to buy a car bc I don’t think I can buy anything more recent than 2016 for my sanity
buy toyota or honda, older models last
Guess that’s better for my wallet tho
it still be running
we sold it to a friend, but those things are hefty
Honestly I can’t imagine constantly changing your car unless it’s absolutely necessary, just buy a good sturdy one
yea, leasing a car for like a year
seems dum
and a waste o money
Too much work
I just need one that Bluetooth connects to my phone and doesn’t beep when I do moderately risky things and I’m good
boats suck
Head into the wilderness, grab a saddle with you, and proceed to tame a wild horse
i've never kayaked
ron just wants complete control
My partner got seasick so I just left her and went out by myself
i've never been on the sea
so i dont know if i get sea sick or not
I don’t think I’ve been on a boat long enough to know if I get seasick
i dont get car sick
ron, u need ur boating license tho
I have cousins who get carsick, I don’t even know what you can do about that
carsickness needs air to be rushing over them
i dont get it, but its a thing
they be like, plz m'am i just want a gum
carsick without
5 gum keeps the carsick away
Oh nooo
Love cinnamon as a spice hate the gum
Yea that’s just a terrible flavor
you 'd never expect it
To be fair yours was gifted, however in the moment I would be very suspicious
Sincerity too, if someone actually wanted to share gum they should’ve pulled out a better flavor
you cant be a choosing beggar
Would rather them say “sorry I have none” than pull out such an offending flavor
i have a feeling i was gifted it ask a "prank"
so i assume they tried to do some prnak
In lieu of his own self interest he.probably had wads of mint gum hidden in his pockets and decided to pawn off this god awful flavour to you
i dont know, and probs will never
rip picky eaters in the incredible family
cuz only 1st kill
and last girl
cuz everyone was named chad back then
who would be final girl tho
it really could only be adam
i couldnt tell u which is which
I know everything except emmys
Idk what the emmys r for
Don’t know how she got a Grammy tho I have never known her as a singer
i need sleep
I don’t think anyone else is
awake
lost my retainer one day after getting it :/
i think it fell out of my mouth while i was sleeping or something
im up,wishing i was down though
Oh ic
Just shed a real tear buying this laptop
It was 1,300 but I decided to humor case and my grandparents wallets by doing all the specs they wanted
I hate it here
oh no u rlly didnt need a i9 in a laptop
The specs for buying a new laptop was 1TB hard drive, 8-12GB ram and i7 processor
u could've gotten away with an i5. I hope the laptop has an ssd?
what laptop did you end up getting?
My sister had the same laptop and she likes it and it’s lasted her whole college life
yea, i really like m.2. they are faster and so much easier to hot swap
i havent opened up many newer hp computers, but if they are like the olderones, should be possible to open up and do maintence
I did the 3 year warranty jic but I doubt I’ll ever actually go to an affiliate if I need my laptop fixed
I havent dealt with their warrenty team, but if you really use out ur computer I and many other people at case can fix em xD
That’s the worst thing lol
Doesn’t ship until August 17th
Or ship it home and a parent will have to drive it to me
I totally forgot I had family here lol
and im sure ur parents dont wanna do that drive again
I do that with my luggage on flights so I have evidence that my stuff was lost or damaged
Whenever stuff is missing from my bag it’s not even anything important it’s like my extra stash of gum or snacks
Maybe they aren’t being fed
And it’s annoyingly small enough that you can’t rlly complain bc it’s just food
my school raided my locker took all my fruitsnacks and left a bottle of water in there
and due to rona i cant complain about it
I have never used my school locker
i didnt until this year cuz i wanted to store some snacks at school
Oh
I gave up on trying to bring food to school and instead just bought or traded answers for snacks
Rip shannon
Sad:(
what happened?
how does that relate to shannon tho :thonk:
You all are dumb if you do. Meg is scary
But this happened last year too
Aw @wuhoo4158 our Cliffords will never meet now🥺
ope thought you were wondering about clown gang howdy
costco pumpkin pie tho @howdy_.
i don’t HAVE costco
rip
want cake
ikr padma, big rip for sarah
their pumpkin pie tho
I want some now
its seasonal sadly
it makes sense tho, its opposites
I went to gbs
Omg really??
Tbh didn't know we had one
Omg I went by her office all the time but I never saw her so I thought she was fake
I forgot her name
Who was the worst counselor
are they all that bad?
Who was convicted of money launderinf
cmon mag, we need 2 kno
damn
Or if she were an administrator I would slick all the stairs and get away with ut
idk you say you want that but trust me you don’t
kinda like a cockroach with its head cut off
It shouldn't move
u know this is why I hate cockroaches
they never do what there supposed too
Get onwe need you
MacBooks aren’t compulsory
no school who wanted to get any work done would not force people to use macs
english teachers are usually the worst graders
The male teachers couldn’t teach
In my defense he was good friends with the seniors Bc when the current seniors were freshman, he was a senior. So he was a rlly young former alum who graduated college early and was super chill
what are the minimum specs required for a laptop @ cwru
and anyone have any recommendations on what I should get? (Thinking the XPS 13)
i wish i had free laptops, Im sorrounded by some rn but they aint mine
i'd need adam to doxx u again tho
i dunno how it is down there
bruh it rainy up there
oh it’s supposed to storm later apparently
*its raining ~~men~~ ice cream, hallelujah*
havent u learned from the horror story that is cloudy with a chance of meatballs
tru, i can’t read
i feel like the more important thing here is somehow you remember what happened...
Mostly the meatballs though
u saying u wouldnt want it to rain ice cream instead of boring ol rain
i think i remeber th book tho, cuz of the art style
you have to leave your fridges open for 20 minutes a day
From what I’ve seen majority are still coming but slowly more people are starting to either strongly consider staying home or completely back out
That's the only one I have fully in person by now unless sis is wrong
Man I wish I didn’t choose nursing lol
i mean, what a waste of a class
Oh dang
Sorry dude I only stash lsd
I wish I did have a stash of mostly legal drugs
My end goal is a masters in nursing but getting an actual doctors degree is a hard pass
They won’t be that important anymore considering
If more people aren’t going that would make me feel better cause I wouldn’t be missing on socializing
Bc I wouldn’t leave the house or socialize at home
I’d lose out on a whole year rlly
Yea I mean the culture is still gna be there just slightly weaker
We don’t kno yet
They haven't released plans yet
If I have an actual choice tho I def wouldn’t go spring semester
Howdy tell that to bonehead southerners who can't get that through
High key hate living with my parents doe
Hate heat n as we can see, ppl do not care abt safety when it’s slightly warmer
Yea I hate living with my parents that’s also a motivator lol
Shit you don't even appreciate their cooking and cleaning after you?
bold of u to assume we're not cleaning and cooking ourselfs
I love them as parents but hate them as roommates
heat sucks
the ac in my house and car be broke
im dying
@chandachan they would do more housework if I wasn’t here
its like damn, u just want us to suffer
even the shit places atleast have ac
they probably dont plan on building new ones for another 40+ years
My friend is going to umich I’m so jealous of her dorm setup
I heard there was plans to update some of the freshman dorms this year but I can't remember where I heard that
cutter gets 1st floor update cuz it was cim's
but rooms still stay the same
but r u really gonna care about making freshman dorms nicer once you aren’t a freshman
I don’t care anymore
I don’t want others to stuffer like I believe I will
i've been trapped inside this cage for ages, this living hell
I don’t wanna quarantine in a dorm
Id rather save the money and quarantine at home
I'm really curious about how they're going to have space to quarantine people anyways
dont*
The outbreak hasn’t ended lol
They can’t send students home though
Cuz they’ll still charge for housing
Trying to lick it?
Wow typing hard
i dont know how ppl do that
and my thongue to fat
missed an oppurtunity to quote howdy
Plz don’t say sex
dont cross the streams :P
this really could be a white card in cah
2 weeks tik tok sober yet I still make references
I think that quotes from mbmbam tho?
Idk how tiktok did but I remember that quote from a podcast turned show
Especially for me since hs was lonely
I just started it a week and a half ago and I'm on episode 80
Ohhhhh man it seems like everyone’s getting into them now bc of quarantine it’s one of the best things imo
it had me crying from laughing so hard
My friend had me watch like one part of it but I haven't seen the whole thing yet
It’s the worst best thing they could’ve possibly done
I started with TAZ and sawbones so I'm not that far in mbmbam yet
I have dipped my feet into sawbones but I don’t listen regularly
Oh man monster factory?
The one where they made all their creations fight?? That’s the worst nightmare
Yea I used to find and play the sheet music but idk where to find them anymore
i've always wanted to play but none of my friends are into it
Never played resorts F
i actually have a matt sticker on my laptop
Ugh the thing that pains me most is that I can’t move the stickers on my chromebook to my new laptop
i have a cpt america sticker on my laptop
Aw
if thinkbox was open i'd 100% make a :thonk: sticker and stick that bad boy on there
oh i am going to abuse sticker maker privileges so much
It's been quite a while since ive last touched tf2
i will as soon as i finish this tho
brother @chandachan  i couldn't load turbine for some reason so here's nucelus ft sentry
stickerbomb the school
Damn case is holding the first presidential debate
holy shit that’s crazy
I feel like there won’t be an audience tho
Cuz rona
Secret service will probably swarm the campus the whole week
Guess I’ll have to leave my mini gun at home 😔
damn u right
cuz they will not hesitate to arrest ppl
Too bad I probably won't be there
A fat cheeto is gonna step foot on our campus
Gotta clean up the flakes afterwards
protests tho
cuz the fbi shoots on site
What for though
Tragic I wont be on campus
wear protection tho
cuz its a 4 week cycle
2 weeks of ppl getting it
i don’t think it will end well...
2weeks of quarentino
Welp I won’t be on campus to witness the chaos in person
Or something that I’m missing?
There was a trump rally 2 years ago at a high school 3 miles from where I live and online hell broke loose in our district
i didn’t get to vote
Our system sucks
I voted but not for either of them
I swear once gen zers are old enough to run then this country is gonna face serious reform
But then it won’t happen
and since their parents can get them anywhere
But I don’t know how to request a mail-in ballot
Since I’m already registered
Cuz I’d rather do that
also with usps being defunded it may take longer so if you want your vote to count you need to vote earlier by 2 weeks
But then covid hit and I never got to vote
oh no i didn't vote digitally
I'm not from Ohio so I can't actually go through the steps but I don't see anything about voting online
I need to request a ballot but I don’t know howwww I’m already registered
Yeah I probably read something wrong
i don't think you can submit ur "ballot"online bc of security but they'll mail it to u
So a family friend wants to get me a gift card to help with campus life-any upperclassmen or ohio people have ideas as to what would be helpful?
I can’t vote for Cleveland people
there's a target ~10 mins driving from cwru
oh then idek
if you don’t live in swing state then vote ohio cuz they are
A college student may vote using his or her Ohio school residence address if the student does not intend to return to a different permanent address. When a college student registers to vote from his or her school address, the school residence is considered to be the place to which the student's habitation is fixed and to which, whenever the student is absent, the student intends to return, and is considered by the student to be his or her permanent residence at the time of voting. Any other previous residence for voting purposes is no longer valid. It is illegal for a person to register and vote from two different addresses.
Just don’t vote republican please
i dont think ballots show political parties?
They do last I saw one
I don’t know
for the general election i dont think they do
Oh general election I don’t know
idk im just waiting to receive my ballot first lol
I still gotta request mine
does ohio have closed or open primaries?
so half closed?
so u can't vote outside of ur designated party but u can switch the day of
🎤 how does clifford feel about joe biden kissing his grandaughter on the lips
Clifford says that Biden really loves his children because half of his family from his first marriage died
Because he hates Cheetos

Heck, Clifford doesn’t have a daddy
Poor Clifford:(
"Periodt" isnt that a chocolate
How do I ping meg without her getting mad at me
@megmcmuffin22 i lost the game
Your sacrifice wont be on vain
Why do we need meg on this
You ain’t his god father
You can be his homie though
Clifford doesn’t even know you
Being his homie isn't enough
I don’t know if we’re really tryna build a family here
Cuz
And she's still alive
Emily Elizabeth is dead

And he didn’t like it after that
I’ve never had it
i forgot about the holy pizza pretzel

no sauce tho i don’t think just cheese and pepperoni
i like hot dog pretzel but one time i had one and broke my braces
so never again after that
there's a marinara sauce for the pizza pretzel i think but it's good without it too
Someone explain me why tf are so many people commenting on cwru’s fb post that they’re voting libertarian
cuz
we like throwing away votes
u never know
I’m sorta lost about the sages on sis
what r u lost aboot
u cant enroll in them rn, cuz its alottery of what you get
Because the fsna classes seem boring to me
Oh
aka, just go with whatever u want
one of the most annoying things is that ppl thought mouthwash didnt work if it wasnt burning their mouth so companies added the painful stuff to the mouthwash
"Some people like the burn because they feel like it means the mouthwash is working"
its one of those things that happened cuz americans are stupid
another one was thinking that u know how mickey d's has the quarter pounder, well a&w had a third pounder
sometimes i read messages from u guys and my brain hurts
not live yet, got about 9h
why are you awake :thonk:
Woke up like an hour ago
well its still about 8ish hours till signup
Howdy will you sleep or stay awake till registration?
sleep > register > fall asleep again
i wish you all the best of luck!
howdy we need a channel when you just explain shit and remind us of logistical Cleveland stuff. It would be really useful.
@chandachan  I haven’t
Shit with all this money we're paying them, we should at least get compensated with a leapfrog or something
i’m supposed to clock in at 9 idk what to do
Oh dang
me: forgetting i work at 9 and not 9:30 ahsgshsgsg
i might go in early and be like... hey i have to register for college classes at 9 can i step outside for a sec
and then do it on my phone??
i feel like this might go horribly
their wifi sucks😭😭😭
Or do they have a computer there?
bruh idk how to work those
You have an iPhone right?
yeah i don’t have one😔
i’ll probably just risk it and do it on my phone 😭
30 minutes left
> is there no chem105 lab
@zhukeeping there is chem 113 tho
Am I the only one whose schedule page on sis is broken
My schedule won’t show the lectures for chem and CS
where do we go to write down which sages we want
and nothing shows up
thats seems simple
with math 125
does that actually work?
you dont need to refresh the page at 9?
idk
I don't know if we have to refresh page or not tho
i guess u'll find  out
Nop I’m too awake now smh
all my classes have tons of open spots and i have backups but im still nervous raunak
Bc apparently I have no free will
Wtf
oe class full wtf
Someone hit refresh
This is like trying to buy concert tickets
i couldnt get math 125
whew i got all the courses i wanted
I DIDNT GET THE LAB TOMING O WANTED
did anyone get math 125
i cant even get into the site now omegalul
i got all the classes i wanted 🙂
i did and it just didnt do anything
yeah I can't find the thing for sages
I don't find anything for sages either
yeah idk what to do for sages
im in the portal but idk what to do for sahes
does anyone have an invite link i cant generate my own
sages still do be a mystery
ok so...new math 125 labeled as "unannounced schedule"
i guess no
cuz nothing is there
wtf
i aint finna be awake in an hour
Damn why are the textbooks so expensive
My wallet hurts
Can we unenroll if we found another section for a timing we wanted
Nah they can’t do each student on their own
its 6 am and i went to bed 4 hours ago
Because I don’t want to take a mf lab at 5:30
PST is the worst
@mootdoot the international kids tho
legit taking classes at 3am or some shit
Rip them too
i dont know if this is still accurate but: https://sages.case.edu/2015/01/29/advice-for-freshmen-selecting-a-first-seminar/
i still dunno whats gonna happen bc i had yo sign up for the math class i dont wanna take cause i havent taken the placement yet and my navigator never responded :v
can i go back to sleep
What math class?
@.fim. im in 227 but i want 224
So he taking the placement test?
Bc me too I'm tryna take a placement to place out of it but I had to sign up for it still
Anyways imma head out again 👁👄❤️👁
But like what I hate is that idk if I would pass it or not
Nah for math 126
but u signed up for whichever u would take if u dont pass?
Or so it seems
if we get an email in an hou i finna be pissed
i dont see anything
what sopme of this seminars i cant even enroll because they say students must be on campus to enroll
damn its top5
Sages ain’t showing
They already gave you ones that first ur schedule it seems
can you rank your choices? mine just shows checkboxes for all of them
u click the 1 u want most
I’ll b so peeved if they give me a TThu sages when I worked so hard to make sure I didn’t have a class on Thursday
rip
Yes idk why they did it like that
it is the sages class
Nah it’s hard for no reason
case wants us 2 suffer
wtf
> case wants us 2 suffer
@howdy_.  oh yes we r suffering
still gotta figure out my math class situation tho :v thanks navigator 🙂 😦
rip
I lowkey fucked up, if I didn’t want a TThu class I should’ve made sure it was online synchronous so that I actually would’ve have to do anything on Thursdays if I didn’t want to
Can’t see sages yet
Nothing
Damm it keeps not loading for me
i think school wants us to no get it
i think u clikc the 1 u rlly want first
Idk if it was actual ranking before but idk why they’d change that
Someone told me that we can even pick just 3 sages
Not very cash money for a computer school
Then I didn’t have to add those TThu classes??
If you where given less than 6 options to choose from then you need at least 2
so just enroll in 24 credits and dont have any spots open
It’s probably gna take longer now bc the first wave is over
mine wasn’t there
was it there and i just missed it?
I SWEAR I CAME IN AT IT EARLY
THAT AINT FAIR
If it’s down for everyone that might mean that they can’t approve the registration to open up sages
damn
Mine says I have to uncheck stuff?
Right under it tho you can go straight to weekly schedule
But it won’t fit in one screenshot lmao
Oh schedule planner?
And that sshsbjshdvsjdkdndn sages checklist ain’t showing YET
Dude, I’m getting worried
I don’t think it’s first come first serve because it looks like you can still edit it after submitting I think
It 👏 ain’t 👏 showing 👏 either 👏 way
ima just say yalls schedules are awful. please dont die
Oh rlly?
Cuz that needs to get approved first
I only added one unnecessary class outside the required so I might as well I’m alr dead ukno
My psychology class took it to 17
Just outside the sweet spot rip
I hope so, cuz then I’ll know that there is a legitimate reason for this crap
if it doesnt show up soon, id give that a shot
then u can export it to excel if u want
Wait I got here so late, if the recitation component of the class is closed but the lecture is still open, do we simply choose another timeslot for the recitation ?
i don’t have the same lab as u thou @stuckinohiolads
prereqs aren't working when i register for courses so waiting on permissions for like 5 classes :noosethink:
So if you have 18 without sages then drop a class
I have yet to meet a person in math 126
I have yet to meet someone in Math 223
Or can I not enroll in the class entirely until a lab slot opens
what is the difference between calc i and ii and math i and ii
is math i and ii for science majors specifically?
There’s a class called math 1?
125 is math i 126 is math ii
i've tried to register for calc ii and it's telling me i need permissions even tho i got credit for math 121 transferred
You should be able to register
Plus my friend said take it if you’re either a math major or if you really like math
calc ii is apparently the threshold for math difficulty, or so i've heard
Relearn math
Calc 2 was hell at my school
I don’t even know what level of calc my school taught
Cuz we don’t have ap
did you go to a private school or summat
i took the psych and lang exams but got 3 in both so :albertlul:
then i took lit stats and studio art senior year and didnt take any of the exams lmao
my school district repealed fee waivers so
Yeah howdy ap doesn’t succcc that much
and its the college board
actually i dropped studio art bc i was failing and i probably would have failed my stat and lit exams lmao, i was completely checked out senior year
who wasnt checked out lol
I was mentally exhausted
and 1st sem i did nothing
i meant checked out like i failed most of my classes in the last half of senior year
Oh
sorry to get deep
honestly i was half assing it most of high school
i didn't plan on going to college originally
sorry i've just murdered this conversation :lmfno:
well, i mean, we cant really add anything about that
damn sarah's schedule tho
cuz we have some spies, and some smart ppl
what is this college confidential
are you class of 23 or 24 then?
i thought ur 23 one was dead
nah we are just bored
*i dont know what that be*
rip
bruh physics is literally the last class I need to enroll in
i have to take phys ii for a math degree smh
ayyy you are a math major?
I'm still considering dropping a class to take math 121
but it won't let me as of now because of prerecs
ahh damn
I think I would drop my cs class though lmao
damn bruh this physics class really leaving me in limbo
what I don't understand is how people signed up before 9 this morning
some people can register early based on disabilities
bitch i got on at 3 am and they hadnt opened classes yet
i was the earliest
It wasn’t working for me b4 9
like 5-15 for each class though
and the site still went down for just freshmen?????
I guess
Btw, my sages hasn’t showed up yet
if my econometrics class fills up before i get permissions which i shouldn't even need to i'm gonna stab
so can't register for any classes that require either as a requisite
and it was the one I wanted
@mag3is specifically i'm trying to dual major math and econ with a sub major in environmental studies
i'm trying to keep my econ classes as closely related to my math major as i can
Oh I singed up for Econ
ooooo sick
i’m math and cs with music minor
Not related to my major tho
rip
i'm a little worried that having too many specializations could be bad
dj? nope
and who even listens to college radio anymore
damn how many djs we got in here 😂
and very much still used
i produce shit rn tbh
i’ve only been doing it for like 6 months
electronic/rock/trip hop/all kinds of shit
one of the classes I didn't even enroll in, just in my cart
i’m trying to make either progressive house or dubstep
soooo kinda hoping for intermingling there
anyone know what happens if your roommate doesn't go
i would greatly prefer a single cuz i like to watch movies and shit late at night
I know at least 4 people in my building are leaving
i don't want 3 roommates too many conflicting lifestyles
yeah that sounds pretty bad
if you kill all 3 roomates you get more room:)
hate that the case roommate survey has smoking preferences but doesn't delineate any further
It never occurred to me that we will have to be sharing toilets
just don’t get caught lol
what if one of my roommates is a narc tho
oh shit true
Howdy says he wants to smoke with you
cuz some ppl are alergic
He wants to have hourly smoking sessions
i dont smoke cigarettes shit nasty
theres like a non smoker doesnt object and non smoker objects to smoking
fuck it i'll just smoke in my car and get expelled
that's a while damn
i've heard case's party scene is lame but i'm not a party person anyway
the border is closed
due to u kno
Nah I don't smoke anything, it's just that I happen to know a lot of weed terminology from others around me
party scene tho
go down to ou if u want to party
i could get girls but i don't want to
i didnt really read too much into it
*boys, i think he's gone off the deep end*
tbh still haven't decided if i'll study remotely or not
so many classes are blended which makes it a bit difficult to arrange
how would that work, do you just miss the in person meetings
how are online Labs gona work
that kinda seems shitty but what ev
tbh if i were studying to be a lab/research scientist i'd be a lil pissed at not getting to do in person labs
college students generally are
well i don't blame her
the coronavirus is still very much a thing
like i'm not the type to body slam a cop for example but more power to anyone who wants to
body slam is painful, what you want is the trusty nail bat
they removed the cancellation fee, so you shouldnt have to pay anything
i wanted that sweet 6.2k refund
cuz its a only image place
so if i cancel my housing nothing changes?
like i still pay the same?
if you dont have fin aid covering housing then u dont have to pay for housing
if you have fin aid, they may recalculate it i know they do it for commuters, but i dont know how much time they have to do it all
I doubt it’ll stay the same tho
Aw man I missed the weedspeak
cancelling the dorm room only affects the need based aid
And we are all, need based aid
i have a need
Need 4 Speed
a need for ~~speed~~ money
What’s the point in friends if we can’t cheat off each other
i don't wanna take movement classes
you need to take like 2 semester of pe
oh fr
but those fill up near instantly
Need 4 Speed
cuz like who plays sports
"But, you will want to first fill out the survey from the Provost indicating your intentions for the fall semester.
i think they're due tmmr
Bruh everything is due before the end of the week
I’ve been cramming nursing tests all week bc I forgot it’s the end of the month
i havent taken a single test as of rn
They just wanna make sure we don’t die or kill or expose anyone
Which is fair ig
fair
i swear i didn't
ghost shit man
or maybe i did idk
Ghost in the shell❌
Ghost in the phone ✅
rip
Is the SAGES placement still marked as awaiting for you guys?
Probably won’t be checked until the 4th
i have a class that starts at 7 and i can't see it on my schedule
mine goes till 9
oh man what class starts at 7?
the class is intro to global issues
also says it runs 3 hours :cursed_flushed:
but 3 hrs
x3 tho 😦
why does calc need a recitation smh
cuz
they want us 2 suffer
they feed on our pain
and our money
and our money
those that have james bader i wish you the best 🤞
is he bad
*that doesnt bode well*
i think the average for the final exam was like a D
rip the biochem majors
how could the average for a final exam be a d :cursed_flushed:
i've heard bader isn't bad he's just a tough grader and he talks slow
i don't have a choice 😦
take it as you will, but you will be so much better off with the textbook information than everything that he says in class
@franklin5601 have you taken a class with driscoll before
if he structures your fall semester online the same way he did with my class that went online, then you're gonna probably have to do a lot of additional learning outside of what he just says in lectures. We had so many test questions and assignments that he never went over the content for or went into detail enough for
the guy isnt a bad person, it's just that some of his tests dont necessarily align with what he goes over in class
which will suck 😦 but oh well
any upperclassmen have labs that went online last spring? i dont understand how that's going to work
Were you able to
you dont have to buy the bio 214 book
For each class you have to click on them
Till now I haven’t heard from anyone that they couldn’t find the book they wanted
Z library I guess
I don’t think so
They can’t really make us lol if we’re online
just calc: early transcendental?
if you don’t have to buy a physical book i wouldn’t
we never had to buy in high school
If you went to public it isn’t that bad but school fees are .
This rlly hurts my soul I had to pay for scrubs and shoes already smh
Shit gg can we get iolab off libgen 😩
It says 2020 edition but honestly what’s changed between now and 2 years ago except a pandemic
ugh
survey says ur wrong
At least my anatomy class says we shouldn’t buy anything until we go to class
case took away my grant money bc my outside scholarships sent in their money🥰🥰❤️
Should’ve gone to a public school
Ohhhh shit
u don’t understand how much i’ve been crying this morning
No but howdy the financial aid office still sees it
i diDNT they sent in a check to the school ahdhdjshsjsj
Bc if they give the money to the student they don’t kno for sure if it’s actually going to college
no howdy i just lost like ~10000
i can’t describe how horrible i feel
you must be able to argue this somehow
really really really really stupid
the financial aid office said “they do grants according to the CSS profile” and “ i don’t demonstrate the same amount of need as i did when the amount was determined”
oh grant not merit
Makes sense but still rude
just bc i got scholarship money doesn’t mean.... i don’t need the grant they gave me too?? TUITION IS 76,000
i don’t wanna be here talking about moneys like i’m tryna flex
you are either rich or you die
The things that’s still shitty tho is that of the ~20 I got into they gave the best deal
and where am i supposed to come up with that money
they said they removed my work aid and federal loans too
they cant do that
i dont think they can remove your federal stuff
Finaid is just the umbrella term grant is the money the college *oh so nicely* gives out
fafsa is only supposed to be reassessed once per year
they said “we can reinstate them if you need them” like bitch u took 10000 from me ofc i still need them
Doesn’t seem like they did
they’re going to let me take the work study and federal loans
i dont konw
We need to hunt down bob
Oh
Shit whole gang finna pull up to bobs crib
He’ll let us in but we won’t leave
Mow his lawn = work study
dw sarah, if we cant get this working, we'll smuggle u into the dorms
No we need harder drugs
breaking bad
who need loud
i might could sell in cleveland if i wasn't afraid of getting expelled
no but i wouldn't sell stimulants on a college campus that's immoral
If only we had leaders who cared abt the plights of the Youth *le sigh*
me spell unable also grammer not work
So it’s either you or a parents
oh god oh go
ill fuck u up
bad
and now that im thinking about it i probably could have used it
omg
cause u just need a .edu email
my teach almost lost an eye from a nerf dark
only 6months
damn
Damn
howdy how did they almost lose an eye
dart in the eye
he came to school with his eye bloody, thankfully it didnt hit direct
omg
why need an eye
and he was able to recover
when it’s nerf or nothing
i truly haven’t known peace since i last watched a nerf commercial
I still have a few older nerf guns
but i dont think hvz is going to happen cuz rona qq
I only learned recently that there’s a whole hobby of souping up nerf guns
or putting bbs in the head of them
cuz airsoft is expensive
*and zat is how i lost my medical license* hahahaha
No need to razz it
Man I miss those days
and since this is america
it really do
Always wanted to try paintball but I’m a scared boi
Never did paintball but I want to prank someone
they kinda feel like a slap of sorts on bare skin
paintball fucking hurts
aidan, it feels like a slap, its not *that* bad
its bad if you hit like the head
but most ppl arent r00d
fair
shit hurted
smh my head
damn
wtf\
But my grandpa grew til he was 21 tho
i havent gotten my wisdom teeth pulled
i’ll never grow
shutup HOWDY arent u like 7 feet tall
but im not growing anymore :P
and then your'e gone again
i just dont have wisdom teeth
I think I need to get mine pulled this December I think
I don’t know though
I haven’t gotten my wisdom teeth in I think
so, my mom doesnt believe in anathetic, so not for me
Or at least they aren’t annoying yet
just cut off a foot and faint from shock
*still no nitro*
i also ended up getting a gum infection recently from my wisdom teeth
i was trying to schedules the surgery and my dentist told me mine just didnt exist
mostly a rant rant tho
I lost my retainers over a year ago
I’ve gained a lot of fat these 2 weeks ever since I came to the US
yea jenin, everything in america gets u fat
I’m not a member of the braces gang anymore
its a hard knock life
I didn’t have to do anything for my teeths
my teeth were bad bruh
Dunno what’s it called :Angryhaha:
OMG ME TOO
srsly tho
Auyyy I think so too Ron, the bullies at my school didn’t agree tho
Smash like to fuck bullies
i think you need some commas there tho
cuz
that can be taken a differnent way there zhanda
smash! like to fuck! bullies!
That made the brian hurt a bit
i have no clue how ur supposed to hold those
Lmao imagine playing bass cant be me
Dont get coronavirus noobs

i got an email to fix it and i wasnt home and i just remembered rn looking at the schedules
gotcha, class enrollment was today
zhanda's been having some spelling problems today
Maturity has left the chat

Howdy I used to type that on every calculator I had in hand

smh my head
I haven’t joined vc in forever
most ppl do be ded tho
having to sleep at a normal hour to wake up for class select really tires u out

Isn't it recorded though
idk it’s not showin up on my schedule planner rn
Cause if it is

*uh oh*

maybe i was freaking out to someone else
i be enrolled in the class it just,.... doesn’t have a time or dates
well damn
turns out there i no math class
the math class was rigged from the start
i show up to the “math class”....
math suc
The only day I have to wake up early as of now is Tuesday for my chem lab
damn
I started school at 7:20 am in high school
I wanted this change
he trippin tho it’s already basically dark
@everyone its been amazing meeting all of you. I don’t know if I’ll be coming to campus because I was hit by a car today. I am alive and recovering but I’m not sure what it means as far as this fall goes
Oh no:(  Hope you feel better soon
oh my god i’m so sorry to hear that em🥺🥺 i hope you have a quick recovery!!🥺
omg Em I’m so sorry!!!! get well soon🥺🥺🥺🥺
EM, jesus. Holy shit, I'm so sorry 😭
holy shit get well soon
"huh I hope nothing terrible happened when i was out"
but fr, hope u get better soon, getting hit by a car is absolutely terrible
oh shit @enby_barb are u ok? i was hit by a car too back in november
on a lighter note i realized just now (we got yearbooks back) that my clubs abbreviation is FFS
Last week I was driving
u didnt hit em did u
People are terrible drivers
It makes me so mad
Because I don’t wanna die!!!!
rip
Fuck a car
couldnt be me
i still played tf2 tho cuz i use an old os
its cuz costco sells all those
i think they had to partner w/ femboy hooters for the men tho, they dont have a kirkland signature one of those yet
buy me and a large hot dog for 1.99
buy me, the large hot dog for 1.99
with your hot dog?
Costco men and women might have had the wrong meaning
Omg and gloria estefan!
i dont know who those ppl are
you fr don't know who lindsay lohan is
i dont really pay much attencion to celebritys, too much money and too much stupidity
i mean u never watched parent trap or freaky friday or nothing
oh wow halle berry is from cleveland. didnt even know that
the parent trap sounds familiar, couldnt tell you much about it
if u live in legal state, if not u get the "weed is terrible" line by ppl probs
oh is that who that is
I need a new solo series for her in the next year or I’ll cry
comic book writers are stuck at home where all they can do is write
Lol marvel cut its running comics by like 1/3 bc of rona
but the creators are still thinking
i hope loki tv show won’t be delayed 😔
Are there even any marvel shows that aren’t delayed by default
next year was supposed to be like epic marvel year
cuz it was probs going to be filmed this year
fair enough
I don’t hav my hopes all high
Hawkeye is a mess Bc they’re still slow on casting
i wish the agents of shield was better, they could have everything tie together like dc did back with their cartoons
Loki was already filmed wasn’t it?
Ugh man I have such a gripe with aos
i dont know
but covid stopped it
Agent carter was sooooo good then they cancelled it after like a season then created agents of Shield which has gone in for Way Too Long
but hit or miss w/ tv
It’s only 6 episodes tho
Big sad
Still takes awhile tho
I think the only ones I didn’t hear hype abt was modok and moon knight
However even as a Hawkeye fan I have yet to b hyped for the show
Loki tho 😍
I honestly shouldn’t be that worried abt Ms. Marvel but I am anyway lol
TIL that Loki is gender fluid
and each author adds and removes bits as they want
it doesnt
also idk when we are getting another captain marvel but i’m like pretty sure she’s gay af
Disney plus is so cheap in India.Sad that I can’t use it in us
it doesnt let u transfer?
Nope
I don’t think canonically but everytime she cuts her hair she gets big lesbian vibes
Am I the only one who didn’t like the captain marvel movie?
all the characters named marvel really need a big change
they've tried w/ some name changes
they dont need to know
If Dr. Strange could see the millions of outcomes using the Time Stone, shouldn’t Thanos technically be able to do the same thing or maybe avoid that one outcome where he fails?
So he should be able to figure it out
But that’s not what he wanted the stone for
but thanos just wants to ~~grill~~ farm for pete's sake
He didn’t want defeat just to half the world
he dont care if he ded'd
I totally forgot and am panicking at work over my schedule
But I think I fucked myself over bc I realized im not taking the introductory engineering course
Yeah I feel like I should have the precursor class booked
idk im tryna rush right into doin it
huh i didnt know there was a pdf
didnt we already do that
since we can’t do pe as freshmen i just put in a 1 credit hour lecture course that i thought was cool idk
doing this again in a few months tho, oof
i was instrested in a cosmo/astro course but the prof had terrible reviews
Ayyy my neuro class is pf too
i could be wrong tho
but i dunno if mat eng would take those aswell
when do we find out what sages we get
i think someone said we’ll hear back in a week or two?
but could be wrong
I haven’t selected my sages options yet
Jahahwusbehzudj stupid website
Is the roadmap for july accurate?? i haven't found any of the stuff it says to do except course & SAGES registration
are the options out yet?
mine were out yesterday
follow the Fyi's cuz they seems to be a bit more accurate
i seem to either get three copies of a cwru email or none :/
I don’t need Bob sending me the email I got literally five seconds ago again
bob requires you to know tho
I mean, you can if it’s still open
^ also, if theres a class you really want, keep an eye on it during the add/drop period.  more times than not ppl will drop and spots will open up that u can take
i technically could add it but i would have to rearrange my lab sections and probably drop a class since i already had 18 credits
it sounds like it's geared towards students who are interested in biochem but not certain that they want to major in it-it's not required for a biochem major
dont tell the cops, "she was 9000yrs old" they dont care
Oh dang
shit pull up homie
Math 126?
gater after the 14 days of self-quarantine in ohio im finna pull the fuck up
Also haha u won't be able to fine me
you on some hoe shit right there
In college?
Lmaooo u won't
Dude frl get on my level math 949484
damn bruh
I don't see #schedules
you still dont got tags lmfao
you don't got the tag
What's that idk
gater damn what you hiding from lmaooo
Oh my
I have math in the morning too lol
imma find you homie no worries
Ahhah but I got higher math than you 😀
I forgot the name I took first semester
They all kinda are ehh and some the profs suck
I think my math class is at 9:30
Dang 8:15 that's so early
the infrastructure that facilitates traffic
Oh fs?
Oh I'm taking idk some random cities
Idk
U scared 🤡
No cuz idk people use fake names sometimes
you know damn well what city that is 💀
But it doesn't matter
shit im coming to passaic dawg
imma find you there
No I don't give out my town
Ohh foundations, Unfortunately im actually taking like idk
im not sure what the 4th is tho
the forecast says its not supposed to rain
god damm weathermen always getting it wrong
if its urs, ur gonna want to put it in #self-promos
I’m not even coming to campus because who knows what’s gonna happen
i still think its gonna be 2weeks in and bam
i didnt look into it
I may do it, idk yet
i can only do so much zooming, so i'm gonna hold off till classes start to even think about zoomcalls
Oh yayyyyy
Oh woah releasing numbers wasn’t even smth I considered them doing
Esp since other colleges have
Oh rlly
but it doesn't say anything about professors, researchers, staff, summer students, ect since march
i don't think they had summer students on campus? i thought they went virtual for classes
I mean they still have kids on campus
probably trying to contact university health services would be most direct?
healthservice@case.edu for anyone else who wants to
if they dont say names, or even if its student or staff
then its still private
Idc if it’s staff or student tbh I just want general numbers
There’s no founding but everyone gets scared when u mention it
Ew do I wanna comment on that reddit to email or leave it alone
Bc emailing a navigator won’t do shit lol at least send it someone useful
My subreddits r p cringe tho lol
I might send an email along the lines of "i saw this article in the NYT and was wondering how case compared because i can't find the numbers myself"
b/c like u said earlier, 2 weeks in and someone's gonna get the coronavirus
Not to mention ppl will be irresponsible and throw parties and shit
oh, osu?
agreed, but ppl are still gonna be stupid
Even tho I’m going to be on campus I probably won’t be going anywhere outside of my dorm room, inperson classes, and getting food
I would still socialize thru here and maybe Taplin buddies since dorm contamination is unavoidable
@howdy_. aren't they doing grab n go
i wasnt sure if they had actually released anything about it yet
they arent that good
They arent going to say we're full online till the checks are cashed
Like I can stay with my family but if I’m sick I’ll just infect them but where else would I quarantine
they can't profit
then they'd lose money
and they cant be having that
they already take fin aid away from ppl
they need more
they do be thirsting over their acceptance rates too tho
but that would require them to lose money
also when u ping me, i must bounce the 🏓 away
I’m gna copy both emails jic they don’t bother checking one
fair
Man I never got the point of complaining posts without an aimed call to action
doing something about it is hard
if they dont respond
I mean they didn’t respond to the first comment abt them just wanting money and nothing else
i dont know how they are so bad w/ emails
not just this lip service
yeah im trying to cut them some slack since im sure they have about a million emails right now
but im used to my high school
Cuz i'm feeling hungry
i dont really know diets and that
but isnt that good
Not bad
that's specifically students though
cuz this next month is when school will be starting
i hope that staff numbers arent like through the roof
i know some of the navigators have been out sick sporadically but that could very well be regular colds/flu
i asked about both students and my faculty but i haven't gotten a response yet
nope
Idk but I’m tired of the alliteration money alternatives
I think it’s a way to pay for books without having to pay directly?
i dont like money alternatives
thats how you in the end lose money
Im probably gonna end up using it anyway but I need more info
im surpised you cant charge it to your account
They said you can’t take our free $625 then leave
so it's basically just charging stuff to you financial aid instead of a credit card?
can't you use financial aid to cover books and stuff anyways?
does one of the spies want to hook us up w/ the "totally legit" pdf's of the textbooks that float about
I don’t plan on buying any other books except for my nursing ones
i guess it's to show they're stain free so they look clean
Even if it’s to separate students from workers it doesn’t matter we’ll get mixed up regardless
Like I have So! Many! Scrubs!! From my hs medical class, but I can’t use anyyyyy of them
also, i dont know how u feel about those shoes u got to wear
but if ur ankles are bad
are you able to get the military style EMT boots?
cant get much better
Conceptually the idea of going all white like an angel into a hospital is funny but in practice 🤢🤢
atleast u dont have to wear the old timey nurse stuff
i hear they still do that in places down south
It’d be both sad and funny if someone were to email them in like a week or two and they said they had less than 15 cases
seems legit
wow apparently my physics teacher has gandalf hair and a devastating neck beard
He looks like what my percussion teacher could be if he stopped running  and continued to grow out his hair
Aging is a terrible thing
bruh, there is like 8 ppl with the last name Li in my class
the naming convention at case must want to kill itself every 2 seconds
Having the same last name as someone must b rough
honestly, couldnt be me
If I find someone with the same last name as me we’ve gotta be like relatives up in the ancestral tree
the last 3 letters of every class roster are super long
if you go back far enough
Oh ic
not much y or x tho
Oh snap where’d u get that
3% hispanic/latino sounds wrong to me but idk
there's an instructor at case w my same last name which i rarely ever see
but she teaches gender studies so i'll never be in one of her classes
and freezing to death
Nah it’s a compsci school
but i would've thought that next would be math
I don’t think case is known much as a nursing school tho
those are reporting tho
still?
The millionaires aren’t reporting smh
i felt reassured by the math and econ incomes lmao
that jump at the end
seems sus
That’s the probability u need
i'm staying in math apparently half of the graduates made starting salaries over 60k
nothing to sneeze at
And when I start to work in a specialty money go brr
not a preparing for the workplace school
I’d go straight for masters but I think I need work exp
oh lmaoo
you dont need experience for med school
i mean u need like internships and shadowing n shit but thats done in ug
Hope to find a job that pays furthering education
oh tru
^ really is
And sorta like teaching, some nursing programs allow you to work and they’ll pay back ur loans
Work and b sad or quit and b sad
u are either sad w/ a uselss piece of paper
or sad w/ out the useless piece of paper
For some reason tho ppl look at u better with the paper
Even if you’re still sad
Oh boi
You not wrong hahahha
Actually don’t
re3 was kinda meh for me tho
um, if you want to slay demons, doom eternal
Do I need prior knowledge of the previous re games tho
re3 needs prior knowledge
I was thinking tlou2 but I don’t feel like remembering what happened in the first one
Isn’t there like 20 movies
Oh isn’t red dead redemption good?
yea red dead is fun
however rockstar doesnt really update it w/ new content
Aw ew online
Yea I’m a bad enough player that it’ll take me awhile anyway
I will not front, I haven’t played a console game in Awhile
aka car socer
its really fucking hard
I feel like it would be easier on pc tho
its car soccor, just hold forward 5head
m&kb sucks w/ that game
you could just use a controller still
apparently fortnite is like 50% bots now
Isn’t rocket league supposed to b free
Isn’t that any multiplayer shooter game lol
I play overwatch despite how bad I am
It peeves me but I still play
I haven’t heard much abt the game except how it’s a better ow lol
My hatred of college
I will not suffer without games like this
*why dont we just take the router, and move it over there*
We got money back
oh, my school just said
@stuckinohiolads they don't know about that orange box lmao
They’re supposed to give us gift cards or smth for college but I have heard nothing abt it lol
Damn they know about that orange box
damn
i wish i got somethnig
I’ll take the money tho lol
They’re just very weird abt the rebranding of the school
Nice school tho 5/10
It did work we had exchange students for like, one semester
i didnt guess why that was
However the school itself wasn’t rlly underfunded but teachers were
Isn’t that pretty normal for teachers anywhere tho
It’s def wrong but I don’t think our school was special in that
Oh snap I forgot that was today lol
jenin be working the nets
I didn’t think it was worth it since I doubt there would b ppl to take abt my major with
I did miss 17 mins though
I feel like we’re a little past that step tho
Dunno what happened b4
*yea nothing*
> Navigators already showed us what they can do lol
@mootdoot  I don’t think we should talk more about them, we know——
What happened in the 1st 17 mins?
I can’t I’m on the call through my phone soooo
Rip
I’m texting here with my phone
It’s fine tho I doubt we’re missing much or else it’d b mandatory
Someone send me the link I'm gonna talk with the parents
i didnt rsvp lol
Oh gosh they’re everywhere
Priyankaaaaaa what happened in the beginningggggg can u pls tell meee????
Priyankaaaaaa what happened in the beginningggggg can u pls tell meee????
I don’t see her
You lost a lot of the fun when it’s everyone altogether
Dear ol’ Arnold is back
Hoping for one place where they didn’t have to
I’m not gonna say who tho
But they aren’t very active here
It’s gone
I don’t wanna be mean
I turned off my camera so I can laugh
I haven’t see. U yet tho
I’m laughing so I had to turn off my camera
I can’t
Priaynkaaaa I haven’t seen u yet
Also I just need to say people don’t read their emails
this alumni send-off sounds terrible
ok so do you guys reccomend i don't attend it
Dunno
It won’t hurt if u come ig
But I have not found it to be incredibly useful so far
the entertainment is the ppl who dont want to wears mask in common areas
I’m not even paying attention anymore
I wanna study abroad in japan
Is study abroad still an option for us
i think there is study abroad next year
Dunno
I mean my sister is still doing her fall sem study abroad
Leave with one suitcase come back with 3 beds and 5 bookcases
i want to go to the Netherlands😳
@sar.hh omg my cousin went to the netherlands
i know case has study abroad
netherlands has bunch o tall ppl tho sarah
Last I checked there were no nursing major abroad so I’m stuck
I don’t wanna go to France, my experience with French (10 years) has been terrible
cold and more cold
I like cold
HUMIDITY SUCKS
Rain >>
Why go to worst
Palestine has a weather similar to Cali
U don’t wanna be in Texas
If our classes r gonna be like this, I can’t attend classes
I already have 2 computers and my phone open because I'm so distracted
I can’t pay attention
I’m so worried abt concentration
Honestly we're probably gonna be stuck at home in the spring or smth
what's a highly contagious virus when you're breaking out b/c of a shit diet
I like how my 114 class already put us into separate groups
However there are only 6 homework assignments
And they are all group work
Oh shit breakouts
oh yikes
Can’t multitask
zoom breakouts are so awkward tho
There's no one I recognize from discord or GroupMe in mine :(((
They're only supposed to go to 10:30 right
hold the phone... for the alumni send-off there are breakout sessions?
don't plagiarize, cheat, or sexually harass ppl
Oh no i hate breakouts and that's gonna b bad
i have mine saturday
My bio prof already said we can’t screen shot or do group chats or communicate with other students abt exams
what they dont know wont hurt em
but there are chads just straight up posting their lab reports on the internet
can u leave b4 the breakout sessions?
So many people left
is the breakout sessions the last thing
Oh sweeeet
They’re not helpful like there’s no concrete answer to anything
At least you didn’t have to pay for it
since we weren’t allowed to rank them😡
This is so sad I just wanna talk abt the politics of food 😔
Someone's mom just called them the fuck out for not getting information about move in and orientation and stuff out earlier
I’m so bored I’ve started to do this workbook my mom bought me
Omg noooo
Noooooo bad
i meaaaan facts tho
Or even just looked at the roadmap
damn
what happened?
Some girl tried to say “orientation is aug 20 not 17””
damn
I know it starts on the 17th, but I’m sure I’m wrong tbh
But it won’t make sense
she wouldnt answer and someones mom really pressed her and she did a whole "you didn't hear it from me thing"
lmao i'm just an awful guitarist but watch there videos despite never having done orchestra
HAHA I feel that, I’m terrible at flute
Ling Ling practices 40 hours a day
yup thats correct, if your doing work study, this is how you get jobs
unironically though
i dont practice enough
i just mess around for an hour every day and get mad at not getting better
Me neither RIP
What’s wrong about 40 hrs a day?
Shame on you
thats hard to get
Don’t judge till u watch all of their vids

Poor howdy
I’m serious though
this is starting to seem like a cult
omg i clicked on it by accident and i didn't realize it was a voicechat lmao
you wanted to see the horny jail

albert really enjoys his stays there
things too horrible to describe

Gufydufgog slow typer
Fuck the lakers

"its all about the money honey"
> "its all about the money honey"
@howdy_.  they do get their income from yt after all
But it came too late, I have my senior jacket
Can’t have too many of this heavy stuff
Sorry for killing the chat
jenin u never kill the chat
damn
damn
We pay the bill, exams, clothes
our graduation took 4 hours to get threw everyone for the online version cause they gave a ton of shitty speechs
damn
that sucks
i'd rather get mine in the mail
took 4 dam hours
never have sit in another zoom call w/ idiots who dont believe in masks
not go to any of my zoom class meetings:)
gota love pass fail classes:)
and u didnt even need the cam on
Jsjshsj we had graded exams, all was canceled for the transcript
Made us die for no reason
so bassicaly regular class?
im very tired:(
doesnt that mean more surface area of me on the water bed :thonk:
and now there be dust where the sun dont shine
atleast im not in a puddle yet
clean your floor man
Idk why but I am up
Dang that’s early
well its probs cuz u went 2 bed early
I don’t know man 2020 has been a bust
the faster 2020 goes the better tho
What if 2021 is the sequel we don’t want?
I WANT TO COME TO CAMPUS IN JANUARY
Raunak, hun, we don’t talk about it
With gloves tho
Can’t kill ourselves tryna get others to be decent
with a glove stuck on the end
We have to maintain 6 feet distance tho
Ngl I’m short
In case the FBI sees this and arrests all of y'all I want to note for the record I had no part in this, pls don't arrest me
THIS IS A JOKE FBI NOW GO STALK SOMEONE ELSE
Since when do we have 400 pplz
Is 400 like half the 2020 class?
A cool amt of ppl tho not many people talk tho rip
Last year’s freshmen had 1357 enrolled
Do they not realize that even if this was Harvard, college students will always act dumb
Not that many tho
But not many is enough to cause an outbreak
"do we need to wear masks in public"
I could not stop laughing
I had to turn my camera off
The worry shouldn’t be people messing up on campus but people coming to campus already sick
I feel like not that many people are planning on exploring the depths of cle rn outside of Euclid
But there’s no real plan for those coming to campus already sick
also i dont know how cleveland is doing but ive been waiting on covid test results for 9 days now...
However I think they’re assuming that all positive cases will remain mild or maybe they’re trying to turn the isolation dorm into a hospital
I haven’t even been tested yet
Swab up nose
Ur not missing much
i know there are faster versions of the test, but if their tests take anywhere near as long as the one i got, one sick student could infect a lot of people before they get results
yea, the tests are really slow
if y’all doing MATH 125 in person... what recitation did u choose😳😳
i not only have to take math
but mini math too :thonk:
Howdy which math are you taking this sem?
would suck if u had come out here to quarentine
As long as it stays that way it’s not an issue for us either
Not as much as students and more essential staff tho
fair
Oh shit ok
And I don’t know if i should buy it now
chem? didn't see i needed one
i didn't but how diff could it be
yeah, like the content probably won't change that much
as long as we dont have to do specific problems as homework, im guessing itll be fine
which i don't think would be the case bc then it would be required
and since it's only recommended i dont think we'll have assignments on it
how did u get the chem textbook tho
for chem 113 lab/lecture i don't have anything showing up
sorry i thought there was one, but i must have mixed up with another class
bc i can't find one
i guess there are technically 3 weeks until our first class
we only need one or the other, right?
It is no longer lol
rip
someone couldnt come up w/ an edgy blue fruit name
i will say tho, i couldnt tell u the flavor of skittles
cuz the usually just end up as a handful in the mouth
of fruity candy tho, im a fan of airhead extreme, red twizzlers, and starbursts
Yogurt pretzels are my ult fave tho
Cherries almonds pretzels it doesn’t matter if the chocos good
Aw man I haven’t had that in forever
and they pretend they never had em
I hate the powders with intensity but those sugar sticks are amazing
the sticks only tho
No need to dirty them with powder
Those ppl are scary
ic, i didnt know there was a flavor besides sugar
At least I know the stick is pure sugar, I don’t imagine any flavors
and they just need to pretend its edible
Parents will be scared if they learned the contents probs
intresting tho
the crust has to be so soggy tho
I lied I’ll still it eat but I’ll be sad
in terms of crusts tho
I don’t like sour things much
rip
sour is great, you get to melt ur stomach
Create a stomach geyser of acid
destroys the stomach lining
thats why you shouldnt eat that much sour
Eat enough and maybe we can corrode the more boring organs
spicy tho
No limit to spicy go hard or go home
Sorry we’re talking about food
SHITTY INTERNET
rip
our internet sucks
cuz once again
I wish they’d bribe me
Except for one
But I don’t haveeee oneeee
cuz politics are for the rich
Mmmmm that person isn’t very rich
u also need to throw away morals
The one who has it hasn’t sold their soul?
Oh ic
They sold their soul for the best
U won’t guess
So don’t try
I like Bernie and Jesus though
:lmfno: cuz-
Internet
I dunno that person
Rip she’s p dope
the less bad than others is whats being discussed
Oh shit,  shame on me, I KNOW HER
She’s basically everything that trump hates
*still no nitro*
Sorry my brain is too shallow for  what ur saying
I dunno why case accepted me, but I’m grateful
Shame on u
That I haven’t watched
Yet
Kys if u want
U don’t need a reason to do that
Ok sorry
or someone could steal it
lmao fun story - i decided to cut a lot of hair off at night when my parents were asleep a couple weeks ago
fair enough lol
also damn thats long
i did donate my hair a couple years ago tho
that must be a pain to sit down and ur head just gets snapped back
oh i don't wash it every day
see, i was an idiot for most of my life + brushed my hair dry when in fact i don't have straight hair - but ofc stupid me never realized that
but I use a shit ton of conditioner regardless
well the longest hair on me is my legs and thats about a quater inch at best, so, cant say i have used much conditioner b4
but from u've said, ur not supposed to use alot
if u dont have straight hair
uhhhh no i need a shit ton of conditioner
sry if it's boring u @howdy_. @kaori_flute
its intresting, cuz i have no clue about any of it
b/c quarantine happened
and i'm bored
bruh there's a whole ass system @howdy_.
Ah ok, cuz I def didn’t understand that
Grammar has left the chat
uhhhh i had leave in conditioner but then it had coconut,
so I don't use that
I just leave in my normal conditioner + use gel
protein? i didnt know hair was looking for body building positions xD
Forgot my biology
i was bored and wondered how nails do what they do
Have u tried that one?
no, i haven't
isnt lotion for skin tho
> isnt lotion for skin tho
@howdy_.  I thought so as well when I saw the product- still bought it
Cuz I’ve only used it once
simply b/c it doesnt have coconut and has good slip
but it would still have holes in it to let water vapour through
Sorry for killing the chat
*i was at house eating dorito when phone ring "chat is kill" sad “no”
I don’t eat lots of Doritos tho
Sorry 🤷‍♀️ my opinion
i don't like takis or hot cheetos
cheetos are mostly air, so its understandable
wrong
Salt and vinegar is bad for tummys
pringles aren't even actually potato chips
@kaori_flute it is - but if u have yogurt that'll fix the acid issue
> @kaori_flute it is - but if u have yogurt that'll fix the acid issue
@lookingforthegoldenlight  what about lactose intolerance???
cant say i've had siracha mayo tho
@kaori_flute US portions are so bad ngl
oh

like im fat, but i have a bit more till obese
How many pounds r u if u don’t mind?
@howdy_. bruh i'm not even overweight
it's not even abt how much u weigh, it's abt ur muscle + fat %%
all fat here, no cannible can get me
i was working out somewhat during quarantine
My abs are present behind my fat
and then i was like "nope"
u protect em w/ fat, smart plans
@kaori_flute you love ur abs so much that u want to protect them with fat
Ye we need that
What’s wrong with that?
isn't it a sin or smth
Oh my Clifford

Who doesn't knwo death note
Oooo I’ve been meaning to watch death note

damn

death note is the only reason i don't say all anime sucks
beacause hetalia sucks and so does iwatobi
bc i got 2 hours to chose
u might be able to get something during that
Within 2 weeks I think
U can drop classes u don’t like
Oh
When I get my laptop
damn, i forgot ppl used to write like that
Or spirited away
Spirited away is a classic for human beings howdy
spirited away!!!!
Except disney has exclusive rights to release ghibli films in america
RIP
Spirited away won an oscar cuz disney was the one to release it in the US
nothing out of the ordinary
I mean i'll always have a love hate relationship with disney
Hate cuz they keep making shitty live action
but hate the expensive ticket price
I haven’t been to one yet 😈
So it's always a love hate relationship with disney
but not anymore
But honestly considering the amount of quality and work that goes into each and every ride
tho i went to didney when i was younger ama
its not as bad in cleveland
i dont like anime tho
@kaori_flute i just realized your prof pic was twosetviolin

Second one I didn't give a single flying two Shit 5 shit 6 Shit 7ft 8ft lol wayne flying fuck and straight up went home and took a nap
U can work on chamber and solo works tho
U don’t have to be in orchestra
Yeah that's true, I just always saw orchestra as kind of a chore because my parents cajoled me into it and I just stuck along throughout middle school and high school
If I had independently pursued a passion for orchestra I would have been more apt to stay along with it
Ah I feel that
Uzhahais im having difficulty on phone gimme a sec
Don’t call me jenin there
Ahh sorry and no problem
Damn keyboard
RIP can relate
He'll naw that was lame💀
RIP
Hilarious tho that he’s doing it more bc he’s getting than bullied and undercut on the site than for national security reasons
They do be but who isn’t spying on us

tiktok uses western information to work on Caucasian facial recognition
Yeooo doesn't anyone know where th do we sign up for sages

I mean I guess some of them are valid and perhaps i'm being too critical
also, didnt they say they'd test us for rona
some ppl just dont read emails smh
lol
I don't think the questions were too bad this time around
i think it needs a dash of chaos then
that or its too early for the dumb questions to come out
imma yeet right b4 these breakout rooms rip
Don’t go to the breakout rooms

2 hr flight
Also take everything back or you’re going to run into the upperclassmen issue if they start moving out your stuff so you may never get it back
If you can’t bring it back or it’ll be hard  or you can’t do without it probs don’t take it
yea, anything you leave they probably will sieze
Yea like if I need anything like a mini fridge or kettle I’m buying really cheap or rlly small
Smth I won’t mind leaving
~~Skip everything that isn’t fun and they can’t do anything about it~~
Idk Coronavirus hit different there
Like the schedule will have never been seen before
Last I heard in person orientation is 3 days instead of a week and everything else is online prior to classes starting
But I don’t remember where that came from

It’s in the campus plans sent thru email
Also daYMNN THEY Stick a thing up ur nose
What's wrong with small groups?
Mad awk💀

i want to have too much fun though
not really but i wanna take so many classes
that’s how i feel bc i try to plan ahead but i don’t rlly know what i wanna do so its hard
*so whats wrong with taking the back streets*
So Priyanka, my experience has been pretty up-and-down because of mental health things, and I am really open about that. My first semester was very difficult, because I also didn't have a good study grind, but that came with time and reassesment of my priorities. After utilizing some resources on campus, I climbed to gettting a 4.0 the best couple semesters. It's absolutely doable, but don't stress yourself out if you get a B or C here and there. It's really about how well you stick with it, and recover.
I would be prepared to study. Hard.
Because there are some classes that don't offer homework points, and you have 4 exams, each 25% of your final grade. So, tbh sometimes you take an L here or there.
There are some professors that will make you LOVE their subject, Like Dr. Srinivasan, and Chris Butler, but some that are a pain, like Valerie Haywood. But you have to work all the same for each
I don’t know who my Calc teacher is as it says “Staff” atm in my schedule
Drew Meyer is going to make you WORK
And you WILL grind for that class
Do we need a textbook for Drew’s class?
Oh no, there's a textbook drive that folks will link you
shame
ah, so you dont have it ic
They were posted in the 2023 gc last year
I don’t have it anymore
I need it
Do you need my Ochem one
Even as a sophomore ik I am going to die so I dropped some clubs and I have no school Friday
but she doesn’t have the non 24 role for some reason
beth u don’t have school friday
Yeah I don’t
And if I get it I have to drop a class b/c 21 credits means no life
Yeah it’s a really cool class I will take either this year or junior year
Honestly hoping I don’t get off the waitlist
True... I am hoping to co-op senior year 1st sem but if not I graduate early
o shoot, i forgot about co ops
i need 1 of those
You don’t need one. I am doing one in hopes of getting a job
And to graduate with my class
Don't do it
Okay so I started in the lower level ones because I was super sick during my AP test and got a 3 when I was getting easy 5s and so I just like had to get 99s in all of the easy ones. But it depends on the professor when you get to 300s. The 300s could be entirely in French, or they could be a lot of reading, or many different things. I would look at the specific class.
I started German in 8th grade tho
@lookingforthegoldenlight She's serviceable. Her class is easier than Chris Butler's by a lot but you don't learn as much.
oof early morn math
@chandachan That looks pretty tough. Physics can be really difficult and it's graded on a curve because the test averages usually sit in the 60-70s. Math 122 is also difficult when you get to Test 3, because there is Series and sequences and it's a lot of pain and suffering. However, I'm garbage at math. But Chris is a wonderful teacher. Diana Driscoll who runs the lab for physics is also a sweetheart and won the "Best Teacher at Case" Award last year. ENGR 131 is a breeze or extremely difficult depending on the professor, and I don't know who Matthew Williams is :/
Damn I'm finna die
That was my death sentence lmfao
Oh, 2 times in your freshman year you can drop a class at any time before finals and it gets wiped from your transcript like magic!
omg seriously
it doesnt cary over
With Dr. Blanton Tolbert. We are actually an RNA Virology lab, so I work directly on SARS-CoV-2
I forgot that
... I was never BME
nursing suck
rip meg
Economics isn’t business

Adam smith was wrong
David the guy i forgot his name
I'm sorry for asking these banal questions
someones jealous that i can bake
You never made me cake
they cant spell
Oh shit the mcat
I have some more stories abt my dad's work in the hospital
my dad was telling me abt how some physicians in his hospital are stupid enough that they pronounce a patient dead
Bruh wtf
Not dead yet
they be zombies i guess
This is how you know they’re in for the money
the residents are told not to leave the guide wire which connects to these central tubes that give fluids to the heart or smth and they LEAVE the fricking guide wire instead of holding onto it
sarah w/ the last minute major change
When we euthanized mice in my lab we were supposed to disconnect the spinal cord after euthanizing them with CO2 to confirm the death but some people decided to forgo the last step before opening up a mouse and on more than one occasion I saved mice a lot of pain
and she cut on the right side instead of the left
Since age 1
@syberkonda omg nooo :c
poor mouses
Killing research mice is the most ethical thing to do tbh
i want to double major but the major i want is only a minor😡😡😡
most of them are missing important genes
there are residents that end up asking if they should slice open the skin or smth at a certain point, and it turns out there's a major artery there
like... bruh did medical school teach you nothing
They leave objects in the patient, they operate on the wrong side, they don’t notice something in the x-rays prior to surgery @lookingforthegoldenlight
Remind me to just never leave my place next sem
Getting covid sounds bad
and i don't call him one harshly,
and doesn't know how to read the results
eh according to my great uncle "covid isnt bad"
Isn’t he an anti masher Margaux
b/c this dumbass didn't realize
just say no to covid, it cant infect u w/ out ur consent
damn rip uncle mag
like obv i hope he doesnt die but like its his own fault
Damn Mag even put a smiley face you did him foul 😂
so once i was doing a practice mile in gym class and i ended up having an asthma attack - and the teachers had to send me home from school
like yes dad, i decided to be bad at breathing
Ugh brown parents always think we’re lying
didnt put enough points into breathing
my dad thought i was faking illness to get out of school once
he was like "stop being overdramatic, it's just the common cold"
*cuz we've all tried it
and then we go to the pediatrician and then it's strep throat + a 102 degree fever
Isn't it amazing how far medicine has advanced for our parents to brush things off as "just a common cold?"
and that was the only time i ever tried it
PADMA I WORK AT A STORE WHERE WE SELL ESSENTIAL OILS
Lavender, lemon, grapefruit, all that shit
Tulsi isn’t too common where I’m from though
we have methi leaves tho
uhhh so like idc if he’s sick?? it’s his fault and he needs to learn
Oh we have methi
apparently
He will croak his last breathe, wishing ills upon you and your family
damn zhanda
bruh blood doesn’t mean shit to me at least
Clifford is disappointed in you
*Weed is not what you need*
*cant grow if hes ded*
if he doesn't, well that's another story
that was in poor taste
My friend from hs thinks that covid isn't a big deal
vermont doesnt have that many cases
@mag3is Once your uncle comes out of the hospital, take a paternalistic moment to put him in the senior care home
he’s not in the hospital lol
ma'am our immune systems can't fight off everything
I didn't take Spanish V because she was such an awful spanish teacher
and wtf - he needs to socially distance @mag3is
my aunt but i mean she’s also sick
oh lord
@mag3is I wish them a speedy recovery
if you want to pay me 70k
I wont complain
Oh are you self-quarantining ?
but i wanted a good ol fashioned hoe down
wtf
Damn that's a dope name
oh there is Zatch & Zatch-attach
Howdy what are you nervous for about college

Damn they you mooooooooolah as a ra
howdy and i might fuck around and become RAs
awww okay
Like how many hours a month
Significant. You have Resident 1:1s, door decs, 24 hour on-call, community building programs, checkpoints, IRs, 15 days of training, and a bunch of other stuff
It's rated as 12 hours a week but it is much more than that
we can like call our RAs with problems whenever.... right?
u have to be next to the phone and available to anyone who needs u for 24 hrs
During the school year?
yea during the school year????
I am not a babysitter. I am another student who has improved access to resources and is trained to address crisis situations. However, I do take my job seriously and I will hold you guys accountable for policy.
stop acting scary zach we all know ur a nerd
It makes a hellish noise that could raise the dead
rip
if someone woke me up from my sleep tho... i’d beat them up
welp, looks like sarah has lost ra privledges xD
But yes, I tend to leave my door open during the day when I'm in my room so residents can stop by and chat and to make me less intimidating
I'm not intimidating and I don't intend to be
my hair isnt frizzy and u know that
looks like zach also lost ra privledges
*dont do drugs kid*?
i need that ac
You can't do worse than last year.
yea u really cant
wasnt us
I demand upperclassmen housing not because I think I deserve it but merely bc I want it
I’d rather attempt and die at getting an apartment tho
I wanna get an apartment now, don’t think it will work
Forgot to put money into the living spaces smh
Will get into cleaning b4 classes start 💪
It’s easier to clean cuz floor is hardfloors
Vjcifufugig it’s getting too late, gotta schleep
the reason dorms suck is cuz they were built in the 60s and in some rooms, havent been updated since then
but much hotter since everything aborbs heat
and there is no fresh air
~~guess we should open the window~~
to suck that joy of learning out of u
Jajahsjs wai am I still up I’m dying
fair
they really do be doing that
cuz i wanna do it
but its plants, so u cant just like exist up there
I haven’t found stairs there
they dont advertise it
Is it though :noosethink:
> Jokes aside happy bday!
@sprinkles2108  sorry, we pulled in back the jokes
I’d hate to only be on campus for 3 years
i really hope the remote measures work and the campus can return to all face to face instruction and meetings by next semester because, public health concerns aside, it's a huge hindrance professionally and interpersonally to students and faculty to not be able to make those very necessary in person impressions and connections and have an experiential, hands-on education
@toomanyzs i still feel like even if restrictions are relaxed in october or november, we'd still be close to the second wave, and ppl would probably be more irresponsible than before, making it all the more likely for a spike in covid cases on campus
The new research shows that there isn't really a second wave, but simply one pulsatile wave. Think more like a sine wave than a dampening harmonic wave. As for vaccines, the mrna-1324 by Moderna has had excellent successes, and I registered to be in the phase 3 trial, because it is being conducted in Cleveland, but they haven't called me back yet 😠
In short, life sucks and then you die
so a vaccine isn't even the end of the pandemic
However Michael, this is the 2024s' chat, and I don't think our banter really belongs here.
w/e u want
There is #debates if you want
I aint finna lie homie you got my respect
If we went to war I would have you by my side cause I know you got everyone's back
Wtf did I just walk into
no but throwing means they had a very slow firerate
Howdy don't be giving people ideas now 😂
you cant reuse things like that
Yo someone answer me
if you really wanted to i guess you could reuse orbeez
but you couldnt add piss to it, it would have to be a difference substance
It's brokEn
Never heard of it
Pls don’t 🤦‍♀️
> Pls do~~n’t~~
On my computer
Oh dang
No if someone threw piss orbeez at ne
i didn’t see one when i visited😳
pharmancy tho
yea, you could go to the convience store
and pharmacies are just small stores with everything u could ever need
pharmacies are for meds tho :thonk:
oh dam i thought walgreens was just what a pharmacy was
i feel like they always be having snacks and soap and all that
kroger’s and walmart and target and apparently costco
what do you mean "apparently"
i’ve never seen a costco so it’s fake news
but you need to own a restraunt or know someone who does to get in those
i’ve never heard of those bad boys
they arent really for the public
so u dont really hear about iem
*they are testing the fire alarms at work for the past 30min, my ears are bleeding*
i don’t wanna w o r k tomorrowwww
> The equivalent of HEB in tx
@chandachan  where u lose all your money
I’m so bored rn
Hi so bored rn
It’s broken
rip
fair
we only suck the co2 here
Can’t be me
Haha can’t be me
That’s the standard roast though
so i was able to check the shop, the only machine not removed is the acrylic cutter, so i guess i can make some "stickers" on the side but not sure what tho
or are you really
its still in the air, though it has been discussed
I’m assuming in person student activities are all cancelled tho right?
i wish i could stay home but I dont think i could stand my family for much longer
Lol the pt in coming is don’t make reslife/cwru lose money
Gotta get away from the parentsss
> i wish i could stay home but I dont think i could stand my family for much longer
@_the_intern_  I can’t stand them either but I’m sucking it up
"download microsoft office, why is my mouse not working"
winston, why does my computer have a virus
idk diff ppl have diff situations
That’s 3 weeks away from parents
2 weeks to get it
2weeks of quarentine
ppl dont wear mask
Because Cleveland isn’t doing so hot right now
They reopened too early
Thing is I don’t understand why they’d send y’all back because wouldn’t that spread the virus even more?
america got bored
I heard abt a public school that opened and the first day someone got a call that they tested positive
people suck
ID BE SO SAD
Idk why ppl think otherwise
I mean Harvard said it could last until 2022
The pharma fight terrifies me tho
and no college
Rip
Well they lose housing money
cuz every single company
I rlly can’t see the us govt giving vaccines to homeless and lower income ppl
People are sorta understandably worried about being the first to take it and deal with adverse effects
that doesnt help anything
yeah that’s what’s happening now tho w the clinical tests
since they deem them as "more important"
They don’t just make a vaxx and give it out without testing it
Yea but ppl arent going to read that
anti vax ppl arent exactly the sharpest tools in the shed
I mean this vaccine also got cleared to skip animal trials so there is a bigger chance of things mb going wrong. It’s getting rushed but it needs to get rushed
People will hear about that one study where at med-max dose ppl had headaches and were throwing up and will refuse to take it
side effects include death
Also you can’t guarantee abt how those with rarer diseases will react if not enough of them do the trials
nope wont take it
All side effects are death
*even tho the alternative is also death*
Fast or slow death
Fair lol
It’s sweater weather today
its rainy out here
The storms were rlly bad yesterday
What’s Ohio rain
rain
Nobody told me abt Ohio rain ew
Does it rain more there?
you're about to be in for a world of hurt
I checked SOME things but I can’t check EVERYTHING
Rain a tiny bit
oh gotcha
Man I was trying to pin that character
Oh ye it’s Kanae from tg
I stopped reading like 20 chapters into re
I don’t even remember the stuff they showed me at open house
Wtf Cleveland was a person?
What a sad name
cuz
they need a way to seperate ppl
Like you can’t claim that
iITS COLD TEN MONTHS A YWAR???
That feels like a lie!! My roommate told me it’s like jersey weather more now
Wtf
im immune to the cold
so, i mean, its not cold for me
I didn’t think it was that cold
WHAT THE FUCK
nothing like the -40 in chicago tho
THATS SO COLD
Blizzards are fun but they don’t come as often anymore rip climate
I forgot places got rlly rlly bad cold
well, the dorms dont have ac
Let me guess, that’s not Cleveland either is it
cleveland doesn’t get as cold as chicago btw
tho when the winds from the lake are blowing
ri, im sorry for your loss
Nbd ever doxx me, I can’t let ppl know how stupid I am
we aren’t that close to the lake on case campus thou
There’s that lagoon tho, not the same but a body of water all the same
but i dont think anyone ver calsl it that
That the Cleveland museum of art isn’t in Cleveland
cleveland isnt that big lmao
It’s not in the downtown city area but it’s close enough to be called Cleveland
Honestly you guys just bring up things I never realized I should check
I’ve only been looking at Cleveland thru goog maps and just realized thru the tourism video that street view is also an option oop
our motto tho
case owns are farm, when i got my radio lisence i could've gone there to broadcast
but i was working so rip
I would never lie
we've hit hard rain now
they are places for families of really sick children to say while their kids get treatment
Oh that’s where the parents of sick kids go
Yeah I’ve never heard of that
Yea they’re stationed near every major hospital
never been to the cleveland one thou just the one in chicago
True dat, I just didn’t want to leave something kinda offensive in the chat. The Ronald McDonald houses actually sound rlly cool and I thought it was just coincidentally named oop
fair
Dw a lot of ppl don’t know about it
Wot happened 👀
Lol not much, I basically didn’t know what a Ronald McDonald house was and saw it as a landmark by cwru and was curious
Mmmmmmm I dunno what’s that either-
get a snow jacket tho
My hair needs the water so I rarely use an umbrella lol
we may not be there when it’s cold thou
I mean we won’t last that long
"we won't last that long"
well, ppl form down south think like 60s is cold
cold is good
60s is shorts weather
highest i ever want it to go is low 70s, 60s is ideal temps
Leave me locked in a hot car and I’m at peace w the universe
couldnt be me
Ohsnap I didn’t even think about that
a lot of backpacks aren’t super waterproof
mines from Costco and still gets a lil damp inside tho
rip, mine is like near waterproof
damn
You can use it to if you want
I haven’t patented it yet
just wear someone elses skin as a jacket boom
Not a bad idea also
damn, didnt mean to reveal my true personality that early
But to take off the skin as a whole piece is so much work
Tbh I think you’re just not trying hard enough
so does anyone want to vc? I'm quite bored
I’m trying to find a new one to get into and would like a suggestion
F right when i leave to get food
isn't rakhi at 6?
so 30 mins
I’ve never heard of a machine that doesn’t take pics
Rlly? @chandachan  I'm not even gonna wash mine u loserrr🤡
Oh HE idfk what that is
Even hot water laundry?
I'm notnordering it from the bookstore bc they're v expensive
IM SIMPING FIR THE FACT THAT I WONT HAVE TO PAY FOR LAUNDRY (my second choice would’ve made us pay for hot water laundry)
YEss omg
Why can't they do it free
I'm either buying used or 🏴‍☠️
jenin, dont buy
dont pay 4 anything that u could not pay 4
zhanda, dont u know its a pirate life for u
just dealing w/ clowns and cliffords and pirates oh my
I’m dad
that could be sports teams tho
but besides that, i dunno
Troll me decided to make it into a stupid meme or sth
that moment when your parents keep harassing you to give them your SIS acc info so they can see your grades and shit but you just don't wanna b/c u don't want them breathing down your neck in college like they did in HS -.-
dont give it to them
I don't wanna - that's why I gave my dad a separate acc, told him that it had everything that i had my acc but it only just lets him see the finances
i didnt know about that
no, dont give anything that you arent willing to have out there
yeah they'll want more
i don't want to be getting text messages at 12 am abt why they can't have access to my acc
damn
agreed - i honestly perform better when my mum's not trying to look through my school email or smth
And it’s on their laptop now
padma, they cant do that, ur an adult and that would be a breach of contract on the schools behaf
ik they can't
they're not "normal" parents ig
maybe they are, idk
@howdy_. ik the school wouldn't give it up b/c again, i'm an adult but my parents would def do that
I dunno why she assumed that I want a tv 🥺
awww
well, he was harassing me for longer than that
like he'd call home from work
and be like "PADMA I WANT IT BY TMW 11 AM'
"Padma have you sent it yet, i'm checking my email, you haven't given it to me yet"
Oof
Nah my parents haven’t done that
@howdy_. I've tried, believe me
||*yet*||
it just ends up in a screaming match and that i owe them everything b/c they gave birth to me and spend money on me
so I don't even try anymore
@kaori_flute rip :GWmythiMonkaT:
like an example of the shit my dad was trying to pull to give me my account was that he kept trying to tell me that my relatives were trying to see when i’d fail so he needed to make sure that I was doing well b/c "my success was also his success"
I told him that if my extended family had the time to be concerned abt what I was doing on a day to day basis they had the time to stick their heads up their own butts and walk away, preferably to a therapist where they could resolve their own issues instead of wondering what I was up to
but idc - if these ppl are that insecure abt their own success then they need to stop focusing on me and figure out their insecurities first
and my dad should stop caring abt that b/c those ppl don't even affect our day to day lives
I'm sorry if I sound crazy rn
Anyone in the country could see one’s grades (one of the reasons I didn’t sign up for the National system)
@kaori_flute omg no
that sounds terrible jenin
that sounds bad
There is still competition btwn decimals
99.3 99.6
couldnt be me
ugh ew @kaori_flute
i'll never not think msu when i hear spartans
tho uh
I don't think an A- is a failure for the record
and ppl who think like that IMO need to stop
get into the school?
and it pisses me off when someone says a B or A- or whatever is a fail
b/c I sure as hell know that in AP Chem, I'd study my butt off and sometimes end up with a B+
"ugh i failed'
so a fucking a
in college classes
It's so corny yet instructive 🤡
Hsjahsjsi I WILL TEACH YOU (although I don’t remember a lot BUT I WILL)
uh oh
@sprinkles2108 i've stopped caring b/c of my parents tbh
and yell at me if I didn't perform up to their standards
i feel like if you want to go to grad school getting the best grades possible is imperative, of course
abt how i didn't do well enough
Wtf
Oh shit
You have to send your mom a polite fuck off request
Nah she can’t
My parents didn’t know SHIT about applicant portals
and you need to decend
And I thought I had helicopter parents
yea, you need to leave that
@kaori_flute I understand - i'm incredibly grateful for my parents but there are limits and boundaries
and they don't seem to understand them
and just b/c i filled it out on my mum's phone,
My parents aren’t like that
Even for brown parents
isnt that what hippa is about
your parents are chill compared to mine @sprinkles2108
even tho I told her I couldn't show her b/c it was for ME to fill out
and then I thought I messed smth up so I gave it to her and she yelled at me for not being able to make a decision or figure anything out
I’m so sorry:((
I didn’t put my mom down for medical info she said “but what if you die” and I said I’d die and she looked very upset
Like whether I die or not isn’t her business smh
Awww:(
And it seems like there’s an insta for everything on case lol
my parents don't believe in mental health @mootdoot @howdy_.
imagine your parents involving themselves in the process of applying to school in any way shape or form
If any of y’all want someone to talk to I’m here
But apparently it’s not good
I'm not trying to get sent to a mental hospital
Which doesn’t help
Not really
I tried telling my mother I was depressed once
and told me to go to school
Like oh I’m worried about a test or some shit
Like no I can’t talk to you abt everything you made that very clear
she also snooped through my diary once in 6th grade, found out i had a crush on someone,
Oh nooooooo
going to parents just makes feelings worse
Wtf
@mag3is omg yes - that's the worst
and NOT feel invalidated
Well impossible not to judge, just don’t act on it
hell if they want birth control, idc
*i hate to be that guy, but this reminds me of something*
I never understood terms like birth control, plan b, etc
so that u don't get a bb
I never understood it
Oh?
no one at case needs birth control
Case students don’t fuck
but they don't fuck
Assuming ur kids won’t be messed up is serious oversight
if you want to get an idea of my parents' views on mental health
i can't tell which heart is the girl bc no titties
Aw:(
The work of doing bruh
"existence is pain"
- i dont know who said it, but everyone relates at somepoint in life
men are trash but i want one
Rip
her advice was so bad omg
i thought u wanted a guy pri?
Fuck that
@sprinkles2108 but don't you want Pradhyuman
Actually no I don’t
I didn’t even get past episode 1
isnt the rules of tinder, be attractive, dont be unattractive
I hate that show
I don't want it
I really don't
There’s always splinters tho
My issue with arranged marriage is this - IK arranged marriage in theory is NOT forced marriage. However, i think the marriage isn't abt the compatibility of the two ppl in the marriage in the long run, but rather how it benefits their families,
even the weddings aren't abt the bride + groom, it's abt the other family members too
Oh weddings are Hell
there is a possibility that it does work out,
arranged marrages are odd, we dont live in the midevil times where you need to fight for political power
but from what I've seen + experienced firsthand, it doesn't
Without the family pressure tho
yeah i feel u @sprinkles2108
I don't want that
Gotta find a sugar daddy I guess!
Someone’s gotta work so I don’t have too ukno
just so there's no arguments about money and shit
@howdy_. yeah i'm trying bro
God if I married another nurse that would make me sad
We’d both be very sad
i just wanna date someone that will go to raves with me 😔
I just wanna be with someone who’ll cuddle with me🥺
aww
gonna need a bit of travel
u dont know what a rave is
oh noes
i'd want to go to a rave sometime tbh
I still don’t get what’s so oooooh about it
Oh so homecoming on steroids
bruh the feeling of being at a rave is just i can’t describe it
I've never been to a rave
I didn’t hear rave until 5 minutes ago
i've never gone to a HS party either
Lmao asian parents be like, you go to a rave you lose your eyesight
Aren't raves the ones with lasers ?
No sex (yet)
Will tell my parents I go to “gatherings with friends” which is completely wrong
my parents only let me hang out with my friends 2-3x a year b/c they wanted me to study
sorry I lmaoed at the rave definition
i really doubt raves in cleveland are very poppin
@chandachan but yeah they'd be like "YOUR FRIENDS PROBABLY ALREADY STUDIED FOR PHYSICS AND YOU DIDN'T"
@_the_intern_ dying inside
I don’t know about OSU
Even tho I live close to it
but at the same time the ppl IK that are going there aren't very uh
I never wanted to go
@lookingforthegoldenlight and then they're going to pull out their stories of how, damn when I was back in high school i walked 10 miles to get to school across snowstorms and thunderstorms and you can't even finish a physics project
my head hurts from that description
i dont understand it at all
My parents pulled that story but ik my  dad was a less than stellar student so he can no longer say that
While I do admire their stories, I sometimes wish they would stop leveraging it every time academics came up
@mootdoot my dad was valedictorian of his HS, got a bunch of awards, and placed first in the state for his board and medical exams
im slow
commas kill ppl
The worst tho is when they start doing a guilt trip
My dad wishes, he can only pull the walked to school thing with 2 uniforms but I know he and his friends were up to some rlly sus stuff in their teens
Going to the state school for parties then the rona attacks rip
@lookingforthegoldenlight I would be very careful about saying things like "They aren't very bright at OSU" because that stuff kinda teeters on elitism. Both of my parents went there, and my dad was also the valedictorian of his high school, and is also a doctor, but he was so poor that he had to go where he was given money.
@2waynice you ain't about to be distributing this year 💀 
http://prntscr.com/ttjaoj
@toomanyzs ahh i see, i'm sorry - i'll not say that again c:
they cant catch what they dont find
Yeah a lot of smart kids from my school still go to OSU
I just wanted to leave Columbus
can't forget *the*OSU
OH
they really are desperate
There’s gotta be different names for state unis, why must they all be so Boring
tbh - i didn't expect to go to uni in ohio
Cwru is already so long
I expected to leave Ohio too
I hate Ohio both as a state and cle as a city but here I be
Honestly idk
The hoops I jumped through of bad dorms meh city hate the state just bc of the good nursing programs still surprises me
ohio has nothing
Everyone’s like YOURE LEAVING CHICAGO FOR CLEVELAND OHIO?!?!!??!!!!
well, its less traffic
@sprinkles2108 agreed - i've wanted to study in the midwest so it fit well for me
like yea obviously i dont wanna be in cleveland leave me alone ):
Why midwest though
@sprinkles2108 idk - i've been to the east + west coasts
optimistic you probably would fit well into a west coast school setting
who wants to come to the midwest
and the midwest is still far enough from my parents
you just end up here
i know you mean bc of weed hate the west coast and hot weather
Hate the heat
heat sucks
snow + rain
i don't smoke to relax i do it to like *open my mind*
if global warming wasnt a thing
Rip climate change
i've never smoked weed
thinking? couldnt be me
I’ve never let any impurity come near my body😌
i've never done lsd and i don't really wanna do hard drugs BUT i wanna try ecstasy bc i hear it makes you love life for a while
Lsd does that too I feel
apparently doing cocaine is a really common thing? i would never
I’m too scared to break my parents’ trust
Can’t imagine coke
i'd never do cocaine
Lol no parents no rulessss pretend they don’t exist
> imagine parents trusting u lol
@mag3is  one day when I was in middle school my parents stopped trusting me so it took years to rebuild it
I don’t even know what I did to break it in the first place
I'd never want that on any of my friends/loved ones
That’s fair
I’m a strong believer in karma so I can’t lie
I don't really like needles
so heroin really ain't for me *NOT IMPLYING I WOULD DO HEROIN IN THE FIRST PLACE*
isnt karma the u get jebaited
lying is awesome
one time i forged a report card so my parents would leave me alone about grades and it worked lmaooo, blew up in my face when my counselor called them tho
holy shit
I used to forge my parents' signatures
that's scary
Oh my
and leave no trace
I’ve never done forgery but that’s bc I maintain my grades as I do all of my other subpar things
it takes like hours
Keeps them off me
Hours is long
2-12 is hours
in late hs for me grades was like w/e
in late senior year i missed like 2 days a week
how can u be late to non existant classes
I missed many days of school but for Legit Reasons
meanwhile I was scared I'd get rescinded if I got so much as a B @2waynice
But i was mad scared because i knew my parents had the login to my report card 😂
o shit
idk!!!
no u take it away
@lookingforthegoldenlight yea i got into case bc i did one year at cc and got a 4.0, my friend got his michigan acceptance rescinded last year bc he got a c in algebra ii and now he's doing nothing 😶
imagine getting rescinded and it being too late to register anywhere else
Didn’t have pass fail
A lot of it was just major projects due
rip, my teachers were like f it
I wish
rip
fair enough
Aw
thats a rip
idk if they did it at ur schools but my school just gave everyone their first semester grades again
for us, we could only improve our grade from when school switched online but it couldn’t get worse
The cps grading system was nice you got a letter grade if you did better than 1st sem pass if you did the sane fail if you did worse
Remember that your experience here in Cleveland is what you make of it. There is significantly less structure on your day to day here. So this means that if you just sit in your dorm all the time and do the "I hate cleveland" thing you're gonna be really unhappy.
i hate cleveland
That’s true but now I can’t go anywhere
i hate cleveland
no bad
i hate cleveland more than @2waynice
I hate cle the mostest
i feel like cleveland is probably underrated
HOWEVER
i've never been to cleveland
as a resident for almost 2 decades i hate cleveland mostestest
That’s fair
I ain't finna lie cleveland browns indians \cavaliers suck ass
u've come to the wrong place
they need some cash flow
i plan to settle in chicago, that's why i really wanna go to uchicago or nu for grad school
Ohhh rip uchi
traffic is hell
ugh nvm i couldn't find the armour pics
If you're just highkey determined to hate cleveland than man it must feel bad to think about the next 4 years
And I gotta work there too
i've heard good things about rta tho!!!
fuck walking
we really skimped on the public transport
damn homie you got me feeling kind of special right now
STILL
I don’t like how far the dorms seem from everything
except the dorms
i heard there's a tradition
Hate the non grid system
How do you find anything
i didnt kno u were from ny
hot dog ding dong
rip
yea, there isnt really a grid round here
mlk tho
also the case campus map is really annoying
i hate that euclid goes RIGHT through case
I hate that they put names on everything just to put it all in the legend
like imagine the traffic
traffic
Euclid is the only way I’ll be able to find anything lol
I didn’t pay attention to any other case buildings outside of the health campus
rip
its so shiny it hurts
Oh
you probably want uchi for that
Honestly as long as it doesn't look like Smith's campus, which IDT it does based on the images i've seen of campus
they only turn it on like when people tour i feel like
u hit the nail on the head m8
@howdy_. yeah when I went on a tour there it literally looked run down
and they havent changed a thing
the fact that they were doing construction on the library didn't help mattters either lol
I’m historic to a 2 year old doesn’t mean I’m cool
Smith the college
cuz ppl do be dum
I love most college libraries with the tiered study system
I don't wanna be dying in my dorm
We’re still not clear on the dining situation tho
Bad
Very bad
they had to go door to door and be like "please don't poop in the shower the toilets are right there"
Omg
ugh
If someone were to
they found out who it was bc the girl doing it was expelled on unrelated charges and the poop stopped 😶
Uh oh
damn
Rip
and that she uses two separate facilities for cleaning and relief
i cant remember if i saw anything more sharp than a butter knife
but i wasnt really looking for 1
I was just trying to guess where she could get the steak knife from
i really wonder if she brought it from home tbh i can't imagine there are steak knives in a dining hall
ALSO PSA 
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BRING EXTENSION CORDS THAT DON'T HAVE SURGE PROTECTORS ON THEM. IT'S A HUGE PAIN FOR US
u can gen find them cheap at thrift shops
Because we don't want things catching on fire again
Is that why we can’t have microwaves
has that happened
There's microwaves on each floor already
THATS why you want gradguard
Lol if my stuff burns then rip ig
what is going on with these dorms that shit catches on fire if unattended
scary
If it means anything I managed to get my floor through up until corona without any false fire alarms
What do you mean I can’t leave my wool sweater next to the extension cord???
what if ur computer melts and u cant go to classes
*what do you mean i cant stick my fork in the socket*
Awww mannnn
zach doesn’t care about you just about not doing paperwork
Gotta hate the paperwork
it refuses to work byitslef
Nope shrek
case closed
LMAO CASE CLOSED
I do care about each of you but yes everything bad means a phone call and a bunch of forms and then a meeting for me
what if someone on ur door gets killed
I had somebody get robbed last year
Not really
Whenever a student passes away it really sucks
does it happen often enough to say "whenever it happens"
We lost a student last semester to suicide and it shook a lot of people.
oh gosh :\
Yea but that’s almost expected isn’t it
It’s college
and jobs dont care about ur report card
@mootdoot ik it's stupid lol
Academic stress is not the only motivator. And we really try to avoid expecting people to hurt themselves, and try to prevent it. Thus, why it feels so bad when it happens.
Like bruh you can’t undo the years of mess
ron, they dont want to lose their meal ticket smh
I had a professor last year who cried in front of us after teaching a unit that was the favorite of a student she had lost when he was in medical school
i cant english
i don't think it hurts to have latin honors
that's so sad omg
rip
I plan on grad school if I get money through barely legal means
you'd need to be somewhat rich tho
need money to make money
the curse of middle class
Honestly a drug company isn’t a bad idea
i rlly hope to get like a fellowship or some shit
On their code of conduct we can’t tho
Yea I plan on working for grad school
Find a decent employer
if u can get a job where you study you can essentially study for free
even if it's like cleaning or some shit
Yea that’s what I’m trying to do
my mom tried applying, but they turned her down
probs due to they saw through our ruse
I didn’t even think abt that
Oh
Why I didn’t respond
I feel like I’m missing a letter
I forgot there were parents on here
autocorrect has nothing
i really wanna know who the parents are
wtf
i guess 2024 parents can be in here if they want
need to decend the chopter
my mom doesnt know how to update her facebook status so
lol yeah my parents don't have discord
if they cant get facebook
they wont be getting discord
i always delete any miscellaneous apps off my phone before giving it to them tho
omg ur parents check your phone
without my consent
I have to clear the browsing history whenever I hand my computer over to my parents so they can fill something out
I don't physically give them my computer lol @chandachan
i mean i'm no longer a minor so if my mom tried to go thru my phone i would karate chop it out of her hand
Once my mum went through my phone without me knowing, saw that i used the f-bomb in a conversation with a guy
even tho it was 'i'm so fucked"
@howdy_. true but it's a hassle if you trying to, say, find a link for a paper you are writing
my parents accused me of being sexually deviant in hs when they found out i was gay LMAOO
my fucking pediatrician forced me to out myself to my mom
and then her mom tried to ask me if I preferred men or women
that seems illegal
and then said lesbians can't have kids
Wtf
idk but it was years ago
Fuck
and tried to make me pick between "a woman like me" and a handsome, well educated, rich man that'd treat me like a queen
ik i never went to see that hoe again
@2waynice stupid pediatrician
shame on her
Eeek I’m sorry
and that seems
that’s awful
need help
women can't be well educated handsome or richh
she still tried making me pick
she also tried to set me up with someone for prom
even tho i had a date already
but it seems y'all and swearing have an intresting relationship
I swear around those ppl if I'm pissed
my mom hates the c word but that's about it
oh i've never said the c word ever
I can’t cursed around my parents I’d be certainly dead
she used to get pissed when i would swear but eventually she realized i was always gonna do it lol
I don’t even test the waters with mine
My dad swears when he's mad
Like that’s an actual death sentence with my Christian parents
"shit"
my dad used to get mad at me for saying frick and i legitimately came this close to calling him an idiot
oh my parents have called me a whore so many times lol
people that get legit mad at frick
and apparently i'm trying to seduce him
Yessss omg I hate that
indian parents be like: get an education but marry rich and get married but don't be around boys ever WHORE
my dad tried to make me cover up with a shawl
Honestly i can’t stand that they force me to change when guests are around
oh
with a *terrible*
and i mean terrible
you gotta commit to the act tho
when you get tired
I thought we ran out
the nosy ones that want to know what ur studying
The fireworks stopped almost immediately after the 4th for me
"what are u studying" *nothing*
"Awww thanks so much for asking! So right now I'm doing a double major in Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies and Underwater Basket Weaving, and then a minor in Communications. I'm gonna use it to sell therapeutic baskets that were woven underwater by exclusively sapphic female merclans and all proceeds will go to helping find a cure for patients suffering from testicular cancer in their right eye"
"you don't want to sink in a ship there either, you might make it worse"
nah, you cant say stripper
Everything except going to college makes good money atp
yeah but indian parents hate anything sexual
Like the gay mlm not the money one
they want you to pursue something you hate that will never make you happy because it makes you a lot of money but if you do something else they don't approve of that also makes you a lot of money they'll disown
they need u to make money
they need to boost their cred
"I'm studying Nunya"
but the standards are so stupid
Studying deez nutz
"I want Ivy undergrad wife"
that really paid off
I’d find it hilarious if my parents tried matchmaking bc I am Unsellable
why does the woman have to go to an ivy league school if she's supposed to be a housewife lmao
it's rly rly stupid
OH i wanna know who i'm compatible with, i'm a scorpio
Idk what horoscopes do
smh :/ i hate overly sensitives
but hindu astrology is different tho
isnt that the stuff from the papers
Omg I want a birth star
i have a feeling
hate to tell you
this doesnt sound scienctific at all
idk, the Vedas did apparently
astrology isn't scientific
@2waynice speaking of life decisions, my parents got mad at me for not checking the position of the planets before deciding my move in slot
the planets dont move that fast to change
doesnt change anything
apparently i'm still a scorpio in hindu astrology
my parents are Brahmins so it just gets worse @syberkonda
Astrophysics sounds hard 😣
the math behind it all
hard
Imagine putting math and science together ew
and im no where near smart enough to solve it
We don't pay attention to what the standards for the different castes say
the billionaires need to be brought down many pegs
the caste system may not exist anymore but casteism is still very much a thing
afaik the caste system is just no longer official and mostly unchanged otherwise lol
omg
Think racism but without race
America hasn’t gone much of anywhere
Isn’t it a lineage thing?
Yeah, you're born into your caste and can't change
and she was like "I, Padma and (other brahmin girl) are gonna sit over here b/c we're brahmins" and then she tells someone who historically would have been lower caste, "you can't sit with us so you can sit over there"
it was so horrible
there's still racism in india but caste is like advanced racism LMAO
because they were relegated to the dirty work
@syberkonda untouchables should be allowed to enter temples if they haven't been already
Well caste is probably what you can call America’s system if you rlly wanted to
i guess
but regardless untouchables are still hindu and should be allowed to go into the temples to pray if they so wish
Oh man the way my life would’ve gone sooo much better if not for colonization
and one of the residents really tried to convert me to Christianity
they really do be annoying
My parents did the decent thing of giving up churches but now I’m the only one they’re trying to convert smh
they be real annoying
My parents don't know that I'm not rly religious
There’s just so many bible religions
omg
*Oh*
oh lord what
OH ITS LIN
@syberkonda idk if u've heard this but my mum had a ganesh sign on our door, and then took it down b/c apparently thieves look for indian houses to rob (b/c of the gold)
Never watched it
Never heard about that @lookingforthegoldenlight
@syberkonda yeah my mum was freaking out abt it so we don't have anything religious on our door lol
well robots miss things from time to time :P
I don’t even remember the Debby Ryan thing how did that even start
Our robot missed the rocket and instead got its claw ripped off by literally the winning alliance captain during FRC regionals
yeah apparently
basically it's a cultural cyst that was meant to die off when it waned in popularity on tumblr back in 2015 but now that it's on disney+ a whole new wave of popularity has become it
methinks you dont like theatre
i like theater i don't like *this*: https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=Ic7NqP_YGlg
whats wrong w/ the vid?
It’s cool that Hamilton got ppl into history tho
nothing all that cursed
whats bad aboutin shooting?
But also snl is that even a thing still with rona
*Shit just went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick*
Ik they had a zoom parody but I can’t remember if they did anything recently
Nah they’re still joking for now
I almost fought my sister over shrimp fried rice yesterday but we didn’t
Yea it’s always been touch and go idk why ppl think old snl was gold
i never was too into it
tho it's political so uh
Hasn’t changed
Old things are fun bc they didn’t apply to us
Dang I haven't seen snl in so long
except that one eagles skit
im surprised w/ rona they are still going
Last snl skit I saw before I stopped watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oBg_MQn898
people have been making cracks about snl being bad for longer than any of us have been alive
sketch shows are always hit or miss
mad
seems copywright sus
That’s another mad magazine
*mad*
I need to get back into indie comics
I said I wasn’t going to start a collection then I did
Then I had to buy them bc I have too many issues
*u did didnt u*
*its going to happen*
I was complaining about how I can’t find a box to the right specs of a comic
I haven’t
Yet
and then one day you will find a box
aw, just 1 wont be that bad
*its going to happen*
Once I hit that stage where I stop reading comics and start grading them for selling current me will b Sad
No faith in the mayor rip
rip
I tried to find and apply to some but case makes it complicated
and i dont have a resume atm
Yea there’s like one that closed today
But case does it weird you have to fill out a form?? to do work study
Oh I got the pdf for that hold on
Yeah work study doesn't show up for me either
U just fill a form and check off work study
Yea I just left that blank
Thing is tho not all of the work study stuff ask for other documents to see the work study form
and tons of ppl needing work study
it closed
So they have the ones named Fall 2020 work study
And then there’s one ones tagged work study
case isnt very helpful in this
If you search for only work study you won’t see all the work study jobs
Bc they don’t use the handshake system for work study
Wait Ron where do we find work study positions
Just search for on campus jobs and find the ones either tagged work study or named “FALL 2020 WORK STUDY” lol
Sorry for iterating the questiob
Work study 👀?
Yeah cause I'm broke
Hell yeah broke gang
Yea that money is put in finaid if we don’t work we gotta pay extra
I just heard the name lots of times but never attempted to sign up yet
Don’t even need to sign up it’s just ur case sign in
~~we need to do jobs~~
My bookmarks bar on chrome is just all cwru sites, there’s so many of them
but then, they dont
I mean I think you can get anywhere through sis if you work through it
Howdy we finna work at the costco ice cream shop
Zhanda a lot of students work at Mitchell's
I'm just trying to fulfill my work-study program so I probably have to seek on-campus positions
i searched work study on that
something tells me this search needs some parameters
why dont they just use linkedin smh
I feel you bro😩
its a hard knock life
dealing w/ idiots breaking tech and making terrible tickets
Where’d you find the utech job
Also ik beggers can’t be choosers but god I hate customer service jobs
i havent found it qq
customer service jobs are terrible, because customers suck
however perks of working helpdesk, you generally dont deal w/ people face to face unless they really need it
it looks like on normal years they have a job fair
Tru but they’re still running events on coops n stuff I think
thats gonna need the fin aid dept
where did you find that
Already received spam job offers
@howdy_. please work at the help desk
I'll "break" my computer and send it to you for repairs, but will just fill a computer case with costco snacks
thinkbox is closed for student employment for this yr aswell, qq
I wanted to work there too
Yeah seems like it
i mean, there is probably next to no one here who would say they arent intrested at working @ thinkbox
i wonder if there’s any ‘24 spies that have experience with getting a work study job
bc idk if we should be working towards this rn or if they’ll email us info about positions or something
surely if we get workstudy from the government they can’t just... not have a job for us
They still need student employees in some buildings
the weird thing is that there’s only like 4 jobs marked “federal work study” listed in the handshake thing
I still have to finish setting up my handshake profile even though I’m not coming to campus smh
that’s what i’m sayin tho there’s gotta be more than that
bc aren’t they like... required to give us jobs
Maybe handshake isn’t updated?
even tho i hate the FA lady😔
o last time i called my financial advisor was mean
she was like “u don’t need ur grant money anymore lol”
sucks to suck
Wtf
you’d think they’d be like “sorry this is just policy blah blah maybe we can sign u up for university loans to make up the difference” but nO
Case wants Sarah’s money
bc i was accepted to the choose OH first program and another external scholarship got sent in
so they’re like oh? another place gave u $500? that means u don’t need the $500 we gave u!!
like case... i’m POOR
idk what exactly they do at case yet
i could never hurt bob he’s king
Moving in then moving out
Within 3 weeks
@sar.hh searching by work study doesn’t show all the work studies, some of the jobs have work study only in the job title or description and they don’t tag it
Which is bad ideas all around
dont?
Nah handshake seems good it’s just that case doesn’t want to use their system while doing it
Oh
Well I didn’t know that
And the filler would be gone
damn u right, its the 4th
we need out sages
So they can’t assign you sages yet
Has anyone had their housing cancelled yet after saying you were planning on living at home in the survey they sent out a few weeks ago?
And I hope for one that isn’t on Thursday
rip
If I can keep my Thursday free for studying or working I’ll be grateful to all the gods
Or if you filled out the survey that was due last week then they take care of it for you too
but it was due last week :thonk:
Yeah I filled that out I was just wondering if anyone’s actually had it processed yet
o shoot wrong chat
sorry to @ the committed fam
well someone emailed housing asking about the policy
ohhh, this wasnt a school blast email
fair, i was like, u be 🕵️ on us :thonk:
I still have to waive my insurance thing smh
I don’t know
Nope
stupid dummy case and costing so much stupid money
they "waived" my fee, but then told me i still had to pay it after i enrolled
Wtf
the waive seems to be temporary until they get ta
just succccccccccccccccccccccc the money
holy shit
FOR NOTHING
and they cant even give ppl fin aid when they need it
oh
sad student hours rn
and part of a tree just fell near/onto our house
omg that sounds so scary i’m sorry padma
we got pics for evidence tho
Nothing
i dont think they removed anything
*worst case scenario
I guess the $70 application fees weren't enough for him
plus the people who committed to cwru, paid the deposit, and got into another school last min...
they smell the blood in the water
ur tuitions due howdy
sadly qq
i cant believe ur back
duh 5head
College is one long and unchanging punkd episode
but then nothing on thursday.....strategy
that arrangement is always cool until i have exams in every single class
thursday does seem to be the popular drop day
Thinks about my 3 hour night labs on Tuesday and Thursday:(
I have a 3 hour morning lab rip
i had a 7:00 am chem lab last year nothing scares me
7am lab rip
||(i missed it like 4 times)||
actually, you could get away w/ 8:10
since all u need is a internet connection
who wants to show up to a lab sweaty
I was gonna say cus I straight up ate chick fil a during classes this year
Like I’d leave to go to the drive thru and come back, taking the zoom with me in my car
Cuz I didn’t wanna miss a thing
Lucky I had 3 one hour classes everyday with 30 mins of “study hall”
lol study hall
couldnt be me
As if we’d study smh
idk how zoom classes work never done one
i feel like a student teacher relationship is more successful if they can see one another
it just doesn't hurt
Uh oh
so something i need to actively work against
i *hate* others taking pictures of me like i'm actually irrationally very opposed to it whenever it happens
not prepared to leave my kitty when school starts
The nose lips thing rlly messes everything up
I emailed the financial aid office about work-study aid, because it doesn't make sense they'd only have three jobs available and they got back to me that the shifts will open up on the 17th.
Part time jobs yes but not work study
so basically just, find a regular job yourself
You can still use handshake
so we can chill till the 17 and we should be able to get a job
finally some not terrible news
kinda tired of school already i’m tryna get ahead
they’ll never know
they'll never suspect a thing
tell me why the fuck i watched someone’s literal hand talk
it seems like a knock off sesame street
they couldnt afford the puppets
" A full-fledged foreign remake called Oobi: Dasdasi premiered in 2012 and ran for 78 episodes in Asia and the Middle East."
there’s no reason it should’ve been this successful
howdy do u ever realize that we always talking... but never really saying anything
it happens, gotta fill the air u kno
i think we’ve lost it
we've gone past crackhead status
cuz brownies and other snacks do be tasty
plus' we'd need to find what dorm has the *slightly* better kitchen and raid that
nah I just didn't take a cut photo
*cmon someone get this*
was that supposed to be a joke, I'm not sure i understood
no photos of that unfortunately
i want pumpkin pie so bad
oh dam
dont go into that classification territory
oh
*i still want it tho*
unfortunately not, just regular chocolate
pb does improve many things tho
unfortunately my roommate is allergic to nuts
oh noooo
you'd want the "eports" club for that
i've broken a pinata b4
what was the game about tho?
i cant really remember
its a game where you left ur life on earth to go to an alien planet to raise slime
awww
tho we'd need to scrounge up some xbone controllers i have 1 (maybe 2 if i can pry it from my brothers hands)
I’m so bored noo
Legit want school
Hi so bored noo, Im howdy
I just realized a big brain part about parasite
i didnt know there was a movie about them
I really want to live in Iceland tbh
imagine the poor souls that watched with their family having to suffer that intentional discomfort
i feel there is something ur not explaining here
i have never heard of a movie like that
im sensing tho its indie
you’ve never head of parasite
let alone foriegn ones
i dont have any streaming services
i dunno
i dont remember that
oh
Yeah it was supposed to be intentionally uncomfortable and tense  @envoke
idk i watched parasite last december
don't remember
I can’t remember the last tine I watched a movie
I mean you don't need hulu just go on some streaming site
we dont really know a timeframe
fair
If you mean schedule for all of orientation I can’t really say for sure when that’s ready. What specifically are you trying to plan around?
I can't prevent it from happening. I get that. But if it does, try to keep it to the same 3-4 people always, so you can easily contact trace
except not go to them
Aw man I cant go to social events?? That’s so sad I’m so sad I’m crying why would you do this it’s devastating what am I to do
Optional events seem like a bad idea
Don’t need the social just ice cream
I honestly don’t remember how it tasted and I had it twice
I have a bad memory lol
i didnt get a book
i didnt read it
Bc I didn’t read it actually just skimmed
mag u cant leave us hanging like that :angery:
Horrible
idk we got sent a book
I’ve turned to the comic life but I’m going back to books
i didnt
Nothing yet
due to rona
some sages classes used it others didn’t
Ugh I hate sinking into that fixed mindset
well we dont know our sages
usually class selection is much earlier
That’s so close to school starting
Don’t even give me time to breathe in my new rona filled room smh
I am a hard no on physical jobs
Yea that and the customer service that required me to do cleaning and set up/take down
having a fat guy working at a gym seems like someform of irony
rip
Which is nothing
But ppl want it anyway
i saw there was an job that wanted it
i didnt look into it
so u cant just copy paste
why cant we just skip this bs
Like was my resume not enough?? With all the shit I’ve done in my life and the bs skills associated with it?
But they hate giving money away bc personality that can be exploited is important or whatever
maybe they will onyl butt fuck u over 3 times instead of 4 when you ask for more flexible hours
They’ll probs take it out of salary tho
What I miss is jolly 10 buck unlimited wings on Sundays
Dr. Bosch also thinks we won't go back to normal until April which sounds about right
5head
April? There goes my year:((
seems about rite
rip
we could've had a normal school year
I hate the people in this country rn
Someone take me to the UK or Australia so I can pick up their accents
I doubt we would’ve had a normal school year regardless
I can’t embarrass myself by having an American accent
I just wanted
Once I speak they’ll be like “don’t listen to her she’s american”
So I need to change accents
My name is a pretty dead giveaway
Oh
does "ronmiester" work
Well internationally anyone could tell we’re American, regional accent doesn’t matter
i will find a way to work ron in a pun somehow
I don’t know what I’d get from pretending to be Canadian
you dont want to be a canadian idiot
i wonder how recruiting events are gonna work on campus this year
if they happen at all
Don’t think of it as school
Oh
I’m thinking of this monthish on campus as a mini vacation
I wish I could mini vacation
But my parents would just make me feel like a clown for showing up
My brain do be close to average size
Don’t do discord kids
staying at home: im bored
Staying at home: *im sad
Tbh I feel like I’ll be bored anyway
I can’t do that much
bored no matter what way you slice it
Bored and sad no matter
At least I’ll be bored and sad in another place
unless i had a car, which i dont
Oh same
I need to get out bad
and then be stuck in a 10ftx 10ft cell
My phone just broke down all I wanted to do was order chicken
Shit it's Wednesday
It’s rlly sad that there’s only like, a dozen Nando’s in the us
til
i wish i knew it was in america
i could've gone to the one near the south loop
I doubt a bunch of horny 18 yr olds are going to just sit still and do nothing
College is literally horny jail
rip
but i needed to access it on my computer since sometimes my phone is inconvenient
i thought they sent something out about it earlier but idk
i looked at it once earlier in the yr
seems 2 be mostly ppl asking questions that we already kno answers 2
but idk
idk how this works really
I never bothered to make an account until the one email about orientation came
ah is my account still just chilling
I didn’t view it lmao
when they told u to get it like months ago
handshake tho suc
i still need to finish setting up handshake
thats when the work study jobs get released
dunno
yea on canvas if ur class has been added yet
Bc I have annoyingly long names that I don’t use but the meanings are nice
i want to take a nap but it’s basically already time for bed
Or nap forever and avoid all your problems
i don't know how many people showed up for the last one 💀
I don’t know should we have a call?
I don’t have enough privacy in my home lmao
Nah not really that it’s just that my family never stops talking or causing commotion
rip
*though I am moving out*
Yet my sister insisted upon us sharing one
also u need quiet for zoom calls
My sister will go to school twice a week and the other 3 days are online
when was it tho?
smh cant even cheat these days
Apparently it checks ur webcam and screen and secondary drives
is it one of those ones that tracks ur eye movement and shit
it's bad enough that they lock up every other function on your computer
I don’t think it locks everything just tracks it and alerts you and other ppl
But online problems require online solutions
i'd see giving permission to screen monitor *your* personal computer as more of a red flag than scanning the room
Idk my biochem prof was like "Okay I'm not gonna use honorlock let's do honor system, and honestly statement, etc" and on the first exam a bunch of people bamboozled the TA into revealing the answer key and giving them extra time
why would you need extra time if you have the answer key
i feel like it could be possible to proctor exams in person under social distancing guidelines, you'd just need more rooms and more proctors, and with online classes for p much every class i don't see how that'd be an issue
bruh i had terrible sleep
was it a bad dream?
i had like 4 bad dreams and then woke up with a headache
that can be filed under v bad sleep
I don’t even remember whether I had a bad dream or a good one
ye, i dont even dream
What if you do dream but you don’t remember dreaming
You’d think that you don’t dream but in fact you do
brain do work in mysterious ways
zach u can’t just say that bro
dont leave us hanging like this
Zach you can’t just say that and leave
the people want answers
We need to mass ping zach
... 👎. Emails should come soon. Won’t affect you guys directly.
won’t it???
Sarah I think so cause zach is ra
a lot of schools switched to only fresh and sophomore campus, wonder if it’s that cuz he said it won’t affect us directly
i feel like they would’ve made that decision already bc a lot of ppl are there/coming like u hayley
since it’s less than 2 weeks away
so my question is why do u not want to tell us if its bad news :thonk:
Mag even you work with case?
why can’t u just tell us if it’s bouta come out
Howdy I think they had  to like swear they won’t give inside info to other people lol
no i’m in a giant gc that someone spilled the tea in
Mag don’t be shy
case trying to nda people, not gonna work
I haven’t received any email
Lmao I didn’t even get an email
what happens to the sophomores and juniors already there? that sucks man
which, not a bad thing
i didn't want roommates
wait i cant even open the other 3 rooms without a keyfob so they're just gonna sit empty
but i could be wrong
im already in a single
Rip I could’ve gotten my single for the price of a double
nope
they wont
It won’t be stonks for them
Oh my gosh
Rip non2024s tho
we gonna be owning the school
Except nursing students and 2021 grads
No we’re probs still gonna have ras
We still need them lol
zach has lost ra privileges xD
hold on imma call case housing and see if they're gonna move me bc sticking me in a 4bd without any roommates seems unlikely
That would’ve sucked though
I wanted to live with my roomie
Someone will be evicted
Howdy my roomie wasnt coming like me
due to housing changes
wouldnt be so bad
IN howdys case you just have to spend every waking hour and most of your sleeping hours on discord
since they wont be here
Oh man I’d be so sad if i can’t get upgraded
Bc I already got a single
cause ppl in singles are already paying for singles
but They wont have enougth rooms in dorm though
Doubles yea but not singles since we already reserved the room
they wont upgrade singles
and they get more money
its fine my roomate didnt seem to want to socialize that much with me:(
So as long as a move fast enough I can have a monopoly over the area
Oof idk
Unfortunately based off of that email I’ll be on campus regardless of what happens Bc I’m nursing
Nah I just wanted to do an online sem, I’m not that hyped abt being on campus rn
this shit is bananas
Bc theres still gna be upperclassmen, just not as many
like not even close to as many
Because our class isn’t much bigger than 23
think about it though
they will want to spread ppl out as much as possible
this is a really fukn late call on case's behalf
no sense in putting a bunch of ppl in one dorm if you have empty ones left over
i mean they need basically double the room for the freshman housing
Eh we probably won’t know until right before we leave
2 weeks before move in day isn’t the best idea
we don’t know anything. idfk what i’m doing at this point
No need to rub it in
im so used to the purple tag sry:(
im so sorry:(
i thought it said you couldn't live on on-campus housing... you could live off campus?
and short notice
yeah but it’s very hard finding apartments rn
But it probs won’t happen
It looks like they only really made this decision based off of the school district in the area
cmsd is starting late i thought
i mean duke made this decision a week ago and they move in this weekend so case isn’t the only one making this decision so late
Ig* but I'm sad
oh what
Bruh wth is gonn happen to the room assignments now
Still sucks tho in general
campus life at p much every school gonna be nonexistent this year
uh oh
Nah even tho I got a single I want an upgrade?
No me and howdy got singles already
so we dont get any upgrades
this some clown shit 🤪
Big sad
and give u a bad time
Just realized that if there were any clubs before they have been completely nerfed
that’s every college tho
oh whale
honestly tho
i don't blame them but the timing of it is 😬
To be fair they did say freshmen be on campus they didn’t say how
Lol class of 2020 tho ruined senior year SND freshman of college
its so we dont get ppl just spamming it
fuck
u are either going into a anew room
hopefully u get an upgrade tho
fuck this shit all my roads are blocked by fallen trees, i dont have electricty, case is booting people out, my dorm room is gonna change to something else
fuck
fuck
oh dang
Rip
we can tap morse code through the walls i guess
@envoke you can unregister at any time i think but idk if that's the same as requesting a gap year
RIP making friends
Or a very convoluted card game where the cards are in the hall and you text each other when your turn is so that you go put a card out then go back inside
we're trying out here
but it be hard
are we allowed in lounges tho?
idt they have furniture tho right
they cant just lock us inside lol
Probably no more than 5-10 ppl no and you can’t be close anyway there’s no point
i can twiddle my thumbs behind my back
@jj4153841 nope
i'm scared
Hermit loner with discord tho
nooo it's gonna be so depressing and sad
Like I'm so sad
I’m so sad too
Bruh I don't wanna be alone
Are they gonna open up some of the upper class housing for us too then??
Aw man I’ve been wondering how they’ll do music
The answer is no music rip
Like are our dorm assignments completely gone lol
Awwww it's gonna be lonely ?¿ 😦
@mootdoot fuck everything is probably gonna change with protcoals and shit
This is so sad
we dont know yet
We don’t kno
Ugh why can't they jus tell us now
@Deleted User I would assume bc idk how we would all fit as singles in the freshman housing
cuz they know nothing
Aw man if it’s hunger games 2 I’ll be there trying to upgrade
No it won’t be first come first serve if they’re trying to put roommates together
scary ass
village still has a lot of seniors
@Deleted User no shit it was terrible
course registartion was worse
who tf wants a roommate in a single dorm yall are crazy
I feel bad for the people who can’t even come to campus at all
so they aint effected
and they don't have to deal with this nonsense
They say oh u can come to campus, and then ✨No sorry!🧚🏻‍♂️
and they aint even giving us money back
I would just hate to have to do college fully online
FR LIKE ITS STILL FULL TUITION
Money greedehhh
i was wondering why my tuition was more expensive than it was supposed to be
at least they arent hiking up room rates for people who signed up for doubles
since ppl left due to rona
Tbf they are hemorrhaging money rn
Sad
we get the short end of the stikc
I hope it isn’t super hard to make friends or anything
It’s like s’mores without the marsh
I mean we can’t be inperson
At least campus won’t be crowded I guess
i hate marshmallows
Rip
oh..
I really wanted to go to the villege:(
if they dont care
They probably won’t go through the work of reopening the housing site to do a free for all
Rip to people assigned out of juniper
They won’t hike the price
i thought it was too late to enroll in classes
i tried to switch my math the other day and it wouldn’t let me😔
they would have so many furious parents if they hiked prices bc of dorm changes
Can’t lol
It’s the inside that counts
so theres no chance of getting the same room back in the spring?
Oh that’s a whole nother issue
We don’t even know if we have a spring sem
the literal only reason to come to campus this year is if you hate your family
nope
Ohio was doing really well when we had Dr. Acton in charge but then a bunch of crazies sent her death threats and showed up outside of her house with guns and stalked her kids and she resigned
idk kinda settling into Nihilism about the whole thing
Sometimes I just read up on fauci to feel inspired
Anyone taking or took math 126
Haha but if I pass the proficiency exam I won't be taking math 126
Haha u won't even know me buoiiii
only reason fresh are going to campus is so you can’t defer for a year lmao
Now Fauci and his family are getting death threats
Fuck rednecks fr
Don’t threaten my man fauci 😡
I’m so sick of this country
I’m moving out 😭
you could become a swedish citizen, but u'd have to live there for a long time already
Im not even from Boston but it smacks so hard
so apparently the ohio governor got rona
Was he/she also like “it’s just like a flu”
Damn
Oh
Of course I'm not wishing ill upon anyone but he painted himself into a corner by not having implemented health measures from the onset of the outbreak
cant even do his own state chant
i'll wish ill on people shit
Wrong emote
i dont think u can degree that
he's never left
Then sadly he can’t
shame
Ive got connections on the outside beware howdy
got a man on the outside
I am curious about horny jail tho
dont do something that gets u sent to horny jail
u dont want that
(late)
dont drop the soap raunak...
if you add meat, doesnt it become a taco then :thonk:
yup, you cant even see the inmates
Zhanda never left
And apparently no cell mate
we dont talk about that
nope
That’s why I’m worried about dropping my soap
dont drop it
Not sure of keeping a robot in the washroom. Worried about the unholy things that may be done on/in it
ill build a robot then forgot to make it waterproof knowing me
and soup I suppose it wont be able to tell the diff
phereomones are not just a cause for horny jail
keep the mosquitos away
i knew she was gonna be president of aau but i didn't know that required resigning
yeah wbk she was leaving for a while
Lets just hope her replacment isnt shit
But Barbara seemed real decent rip
Us ‘24’s got it bad
And then a good president is leaving
2020 do suck
oh dang u rite, you cant do orientation if nobody is on campus to do it
Oh snap
Didn’t think abt that
OLs are approved to stay on campus if they want, but they aren’t allowed to just stay for Discover Week then skrrt. So yeah lots more OLs are going remote than originally planned.
Damn I was dying to taste Barbara's homemade rhubarb pie
now man, you dont want to be having sailors mouth, now doncha
For running a fucking school
yup, im guessing shes leaving
apparently the president of baylor university made almost 5 million in 2016
which seems totally reasonable
corn on the cob is great but ends up getting stuck everywhere
what event would you want to drive out here for???
i feel like most of this is just tourists destinations that i'd rather go to on my own
case trying to sprinkle powdered sugar on a dog shit situation
all my friends are pissed lmao
they all bought plane tickets
as i said case needs to reimburse transportation fees spent getting to campus
LMAOOO i dont expect much from a school who values money over students
i feel bad for OLs who are already back
cuz soph and juniors arent allowed to be back
they get the money from the freshman who cant transfer well due to sages
if everyone on campus get their own room i wonder how spring sem would work
Can’t I just do all of this discover cle stuff on my own?
case is trying desperatly to keep us freshmen at the school
they need that monies
Not like that many freshmen are actually trying to leave the school
u dont hav to attend discover cleveland. many attend so they can explore cleveland and learn how to use the rta
who wants to do online college from their house
this aint education connection
I don’t know the recent count on the fb poll
So a lot of us want to be on campus
would it be creepy to cold text my roommates and ask if they're gonna be on campus
HOT DIGGITY DOG
Damn I'm glad I used google + in middle school
it could happen to YOU
im surprised y'all dont just vc
if ur not storrs and u enter the chat it will trigger a laserbeam that shoots thru ur webcam into your brain killing you instantly
what if i dont turn on webcam
zhanda trying to commit genocide out here
i don't even have zoom downloaded
im on my phone muchacho
they are starting to pile up
Nope
Nope
And I won’t even tell you if you get it
Nope
Oh
Howdy doesn’t do zoom
Nope and no
He’s not on the zoom call he wouldn’t want to
and nothing, a bit misguided, but im also not a :simp:
need a tissue?
*i just had to do 17-6 im slow*
which is close to 7
Dude it doesn't work
Like it keeps losing
i mean im naked ofc i wouldn't b on zoom
i cant hop to a place i already be at
I haven't been given authorization under the hipaa act
last i heard thats why doctors couldnt use it
seriously
did someone make one of those planet memes for this situation already
bc i dont like viewing art alone
Cle history center seems aight
we're still on zoom
OH
Alright it doesn't work but ok I
this isn't an enticement
*off with your head*
I don't get it
you dont have to
Isn't it only
zhanda's going to jail, rip
Like u can't do more than
ShIt
i dunno, im probably not signing up for any activities, since i've been to all the places b4
shame thats online, thats something that could easily be done in person
I will say to those deciding, i dont know if it will be open, but the natural history and the history museum are fun, one has space, the other one has a merry go round
dunno, if you want to do it, try it
i will say, during non rona times, most of these places arent too far away
so if you see something u rlly want to do
you can really get this server small if you shrink everything
she'll still see it
ic, i dont have a tv, so probs not
~~u can find it on Netflix~~
dont got that either
do have a ship tho
Did everything bad
Except for that one thing
that doesnt seem v balanced
wouldnt the middle be like earth tho
cuz good n bad is the traditioanl heaven n hell
Mehhh
I don’t wanna spoil it so I’m not gonna talk more ||and say that this good place doesn’t exist and they all are in the bad place||
i'd take it tho
Well, initially 
And then chaos occurs
And ur not chillin anymore
Find someone with a Netflix and watch it
I highly recommend it
Sorry for being a noob in explaining stuff
For my religion ~~as far as I know~~
U get tortured into accordance with the bad things u did
~~and I don’t think there is gonna be a social life involved~~
nerd or geek tho
but speaking of active ppl getting promoted, we dont have it setup, but some discord bots have a leveling system where ur messages give u xp
i can't do any of the orientation activities
Cuz of 2 week quarantine
Sigh
gonna have to leave for the states earlier than planned cuz of this
Hey I’m feeling optimistic today
Guys last night I was told if I wanted to go to campus to like, hang with people one weekend or whatever I cannnnn
And bootmun aw I’m sorry:((
Who knows maybe I already got it and it went away
Because I work a job
Someone doesn’t want me on campus :thonk:
Still stuck at home lmao
it ruined my summer plans
now it's ruining my travel and college plans
rip
Aw:(
Fck corona all my homies hate corona
I'm kind of worried about classes. I'm in a situation where I'm not exactly on campus but I'm not too far away from it since I only have to spend the first week of college off campus.
Don’t cards go bad if you leave them near your phone?
cuz like I'm in a middle ground
that was the old cards when they were still working on the tech
Because I had this happen to me 2 years go
well classes don’t start till the 24th right?
Ok regardless bartleby is a website where you can get answers to you homework really
I heard that sometimes teachers and TAs put up test questions (only happened during the pandemic) on chegg and bartleby and whoever basically wrote down the answer or something similar was failed
That happened at BU
and get all the questions wrong intencionlly
Or just be too broke to afford chegg and bartleby lmao
It’s like the pdf of the answers and a picture of my work
o i never sent a pic of my work bc my school uses the same thing as cwru does (turnitin)
I mean my school used it too
no need for that
Bad handwriting is a strat
I don’t wanna spend it there
fair
You can come in the day before we leave Priyanka
When we get the email saying we have to start packing to leave within the week
A goodbye ice cream lol
Can’t forget Clifford
I sent an email to the department assistant of the center for international affairs regarding the whole quarantine situation but I have yet to see a reply.
I hope she answers asap cuz like my whole scheduling is dependent upon her reply.
they be slow
Rip
everyone i’ve emailed has normally got back to me by the end of the day
Rip
Did you leave a msg ?
leave a voicemail
when i left a voicemail
I'll leave a voice mail but it's like 1 am over here
Rip
Yea I tried doing that
Lol I ain’t gonna do that
oh found it
Priyanka I don’t think it’s compulsory for us
they want u 2 do it tho
well idk if we HAVE to
but they want us to
i thought it said they wanted u 2
ill do it cuz im bored
I don’t wanna understand
nope
oh? :cursed_flushed:
you cannot choose to leave horny jail tho
idc i was never a part of it
cuz rona be happening instantly
Who wants to be my Minecraft girlfriend

when you could pirate it instead
wtf raunak lmao
lol I don’t even play minecraft
nope, what is there to reorient
Now I don’t wanna
Sorry raunak
oh no no no
sorry raunak ig you deserve better
Sorry man, you’ll find love someday
This is worse than going to an all boys school for 15 years 😔
damn
let us know how bad the skit is tho
its so bad
smh, for all the money they slurped, you'd think they'd have a higher production value
I’m no longer doing it
I mean, its made by the nursing students tho, so its not that bad
How did you make it worse
I really don’t think we have to do it Priyanka
did you guys have the not anymore training yet?
i dont think so
Don’t think so
Not anymore training?
oh no
Too many training. Brain go hurty
are they still vibing
ZBT is getting sm shit
I’m on a roll today these videos are making me upset
they cant murder u without ur concent

Don’t lie

damn
raunak, dont take this kind of aboose

it’s B tho right
Didn’t watch the entire video to go to the second one
No nose dicks
i just got scared by words
the choices aren't jumbled
The thought is appreciated tho if there’s any case admin spies in here
We don’t kno
Can’t rlly screen them lol
parents on reddit wtf
There was a mom on the subred like “I’m worried about my sons room situation does he need a printer?”
shit
don’t
my parents dont know what reddit is
it could be the parents be 🚁
youre supposed to stay anonymous on reddit
My mom knows because I talk about it but luckily she hates social media
and the kid doesnt want them 2 kno
my mom knows but she doesnt know the name
rip ron
Aight imma head out
Don’t be shy reveal yourself
tis a vine reference DONT REPORT ME TO BOB
Never seen one tho
my parents dont know what life 360 is
they still have my location
just work
My dad tried to use find my friends
Rip
No i cant howdy
or open office
EVEN THOUGH
What’s wrong w google docs?
I still miraculously kept my MS suite with my high school credentials lmao
i'd rather not have my location be tracked by parents
you dont need to create an account
i didnt see that on handshake
dont go to the normal handshake
No you don’t
I didnt have to
it will be wrong
shit
handshake is for work study ppl
if you arent that, ur probably good without it
no i want money tho
i mean i got mine figured out
did you tho
oh
the on campus jobs listed there rn is work study, but if you could try working at a real place part time
dunno how it will work from rona tho
Not all the part time are work study only tho I think
since im home
you can call the student employment offices if you get stuck, but it should be p easy
you want jobs remote or on campus
it wasnt in nyc
i never liked durags all that much
This module is so boring
Ugh
I hope my sister is still skipping the modules these tacos are taking a second
She’s horrible at checking texts smh
why cant we just agree that covid 19 is bad
why do we need a videoooo ughhh
Big sigh
and some ppl dont wear mask
damn
You will not be able to live on campus --> ||Take yo dumbass home||
24 days a week 7 hours a month
I hate these moduuules
My sister is still working
Mine wouldn’t have either if not for these tacos
also looks like i can't have sleepovers with yall hmph
Aw man 😔
cuz we'll be punished under student conduct
Damn it
Also I can’t fast forward in the videos
But it won’t let me move forward
they can say it against the student conduct rules, cant do that 6ft apart Ron
Not if the dildo is long enough
no one said fucking
nope if you right click you can change the speed
Guess we really need to start working out to get ready for those dildos
6.1 feet long
Wtf did I walk back into
Not bad
does clifford want to come?
Can’t say no to that
dont curse the childhood
clifford woudnt need the dildo
This is going so bad lmaooooo
ngl i cant belive nth here has been quoted
Oh
Someone save me
sorry i interrupted whatever was happening
> MY CRINGE LEVELS
@sprinkles2108  POOR ACTORS
GOD DAMN
You missed the fun
nothing just some very pure and thoughtful conversation
also yall something i just found out that scared da shit outta me. if ur not living on campus case is cutting ur financial aid
my old roommate was like stay on campus if not they cut ur scholarships
oh dear
they cut ur mERIT AID?
its not merit aid, they cut anything given thru the fafsa
oh phew
Yeah I called they don’t cut merit aid
bc by that logic any upperclassmen that moves off campus no longer gets merit aid
Seriously?
That if you move off campus you lose merit aid
OH
I didn’t see the logic part
Yet we chose to go to Case
i mean every school takes our money
yall actin like every other school dont do this
j'ai plusieurs dildos, dont un dildo rouge, un dildo vert
idk
idk if i spelled that right
Oh no
Isn’t teacher Lao shi
but can't spell it
I suck at pinyin much better at just reading the characters as is
its okay I suck at both
im on my lap top and dont have the keyboard rn 😦
i took unity and c# junior year and java/java script my senior year... after taking spanish for freshman and sophomore
damm compsci was a math credit for us
Das die der deb
Oh my
oh right then there's aktiv cases
it doesn't mean hi
could be worse though
i can't remember
he was in primary school i think
rip
you hate it when they are those perfect angles
@sar.hh did you ping me for some reason earlier?
Cause I got a read alert kinda thinks
Damn it be 3am. Ight imma head out
I really want to lol
adam someone asked if there were any parents on here
nope
im slow
it doesnt come up on mobile
need to chill with us more down here
i dont need to say as much 😌
as of rn, pri seems to be 2nd
well not anymore
and for the record, mine are more important as I've never bitched about how people need to go to horny jail
cant argue w/ that
I'm just surprised there isn't #games channel
didn't know that
out stuff will most likely be confiscated *read: sold on ebay*
Assume that all furniture you want to abandon will be trashed and not returned
they won’t go through the work of giving back or shipping stuff out
no refunds either
they arent a place of learnign after all
isnt adobe reader free?
No I just downloaded adobe acrobat sorry
Rip it comes w the laptop
Okay so it seems like a waste to say goodbye to a fridge after 3 months so ill just get mine locally now
costco or craigslist i guess
Also bc I don’t know how my room looks I don’t wanna buy anything big
the room isnt big
So you may not even need the fridge
damn i wish they would tell us stuff
No one knows what’s happening except for babs ig
She probably doesn’t know either bc people in power rarely have any actual power
Sad that it’s fake
i don’t think we know yet
probably though idk how they’re going to fit us all in the freshmen dorms
I heard we’re staffing some OLs on south side for move-in days, so first-years on south side seems to be the case. Idk how many.
hope you can come tho fr
I be killing the hell out of convos lmfao
Might up and road trip tomorrow idk I’m feeling *spicy*
if you're feeling spicy, eat some spicy food
That’s what I thought but I didn’t wanna look silly
a man w/ good and bad in split down the mid
fair, but he can only decide by the flip of a coin
But then how do you determine which is head which is tails
Cover your nose
Don't die!
Quote of the year: don’t die
they must have gotten the student's money already
They’re confident announcing this because their brand is strong enough that students will still pay
case  most certainly doesnt have that
ask anyone outside of academics about case and they will have never heard of them
we dont do sports here
cuz nobody comes here to sport
*and no one would want to*
i dont think we have that store here
Okay someone pinged me again
But the text isn’t showing up
Idk why they even bothered to make some of them inperson
And have them leave case every 20 minutes
Bc the art museum isn’t supposed to be 2 hours long, the time slot is so big because they have you split up into smaller groups to enter
I cannot spend an entire week without bubble tea
i didn't even realize that they'd do a shorter trip of the museum
bc like there are a lot of stuff at the museum! it didn't occur to me they wouldn't show us everything
Yea that’s why I didn’t sign up I wanna go on my own time
There's a gongcha near where I live
Tea’amo and tsaocaa in Chicago are top tier for me idk if they’re franchises tho
There's used to be a black market for boba tea in my school
How would that even work lol
Everyone kept ordering boba tea to the school so much that it overwhelemed the school security office
Omg
Y’all can order stuff to you school? Damn
I think you can even get delivery to the top of a god damn mountain here
I find that to be hilarious
just goes to show that prohibition solves absolutely nothing
I'd rather our school just opens a boba tea shop inside campus
Rip
But still
I went to a teriyaki place in seattle last summer and they sold boba tea there too lmao
It kind of sucks it took this long for boba tea to explode into popularity
This pleases me to no end
I don’t like it separately on it’s own
They sold so many green tea flavored things
Apparently tea asmr and cooking asmr is a thing....
Oh man I hate asmr but I’m interested
If anyone wants to hit up algebra tea house with me on campussssss
It’s so I don’t look bad buying 3 different teas and consuming them all
Rip
2 weeks of being stuck in a hotel room
Rip
Everytime I see those quarantine packs that some other governments give out I get so jealous
Rip
I wanted to go to the original starbucks in seattle
And went nope
the starbucks here might be closed given they dont exactly have a good social distancing place
Rip
not like sitting down tho or dine in
Damn
I feel uncomfortable sitting in places now lol
It's no longer as effective as before tho
Cuz that shit tastes like piss
Never again
The only alcohol I want to try is flavored vodka
I only want to try cocktails
Fuck no
I aint drinking sizzling piss
u kno you could just try one whenever, no one is going to stop you, just dont over do it, cuz alchol does taste terrible
Nah my liver is already bad I won’t risk it
I don't get why people are so hyped for beer when it just tastes awful
I got the liver of a smoker but I have never
what happened to it?
arent they supposed to grow back?
It’s why all the smokers n drinkers need transplants
spoilers, it doesnt taste good
But you can’t rlly get cocktails until ur legal
but, i've tried most of the kinds u can make at home
Rip
I never had soju
It’s famous for a reason tho
I'l temporarily be at chicago cuz connecting flights
All the staples are in the airport you don’t even need to leave
Yea they suck
Airport staples suck
Rip
@Deleted User which airport?
my brain is on it last two cells
Probably need to sleep
I forgot the name <_< anyways o’hare is a pretty alright airport and you can find some good food
I guess I can get a quick snack before my next flight
its gonna be worse actually
Airplane food definitely worse
$3 for a fucking bottle of water
Smh I always spell it wrong
Airplane food in the business class  seats are decent tho
business class is like the elite shit
I still wouldn’t wanna eat plane food
damn
damn
This was last summer
My dad never gets enough so he donates them
Spent an hour in line after arriving at the airport
fair
you might make it to lou's with a longer layover or some zooming
but i dont know how long u got
So it’s no longer exclusive
Isn't there a little italy in cleveland
see how long it would take u to get from airport and back
I’m sure there’s a gio in the actual airport tho
Rip
I heard its open again tho
Sigh
Idk how many more plans i'm going to have to toss out the window
Rip
Gonna visit it when rona goes away
There’s poppin top hat in Detroit it’s good shit
Oh snap
If im stuck in cle for my birthday I’m coercing someone into buying me this birthday box
If I can't return to korea this winter
Idk where to go
Rip
1 month long florida coaster tour?
Not Florida rip
bad idea
Sigh
tho, i do say, stay away from florida
and those who dont
If i'm forced to stay in ohio might as well go on a 1 month long ohio coaster tour
kings island is real down south tho
So time isn't an issue
probably now due to rona
Rip
No curfew but there’s quiet hours
Sorry man
Oh shit
Now I really gotta sleep
bruh there’s quiet hours?
rip
Lol what you don’t wanna study or sleep??
no but i think quiet hours at a college is stoopid especially like midnight on a weekend
also i guess they don't want anyone playing electric guitar at 4 AM
You can still play electric guitar sure but don’t b loud
do ppl actually enforce quiet hours tho
It really depends on your RA and year
and believe me, if i get woken up at 4 am by an electric gutair, consider ur kneecaps to be gone
If the ra doesn't like our drums then we eat him or her alive
Drumming isn’t that bad tho
I definitely accept fruit snacks thrown under the door. I keep my room super clean so I have no qualms.
Sad
Awww
That shit is like a hotel
Sorry for a vid in general but it's pertinent
Oh lit
i'm still a little peeved i can't even open the bedrooms in my unit that are gonna be empty to use as storage or something
And we're going through and cleaning now
Also tbh the leutner boxed lunches aren't that bad. Today was A turkey and brie croissant with apple butter and lettuce, chips, a vegan cookie, and water
Nope, I'm a freshman RA @raunakwastaken a lucky few of you are going to be my guys
rip, i hope they dont scrap online ordering
@mootdoot no, it's just been camp style for the moment since its only us and RHA on campus as of right now
tbh way more nutritious than I would usually pick to eat at regular leutner, but I don't eat completely crap, I do eat my veg
cant lose what you never had
there's also a bunch of shit i've never tried that i'm excited to, all kinds of cultural options
one japanese restaurant serves whole marinated baby octopi? i wanna try that
There’s only Kung fu tea it seems
I'm Asian and I have never tasted boba
You can get by without boba
Tbh #2 I am also going to be really strict on parties this year (I'm one of the stricter RAs to begin with but I'm fair about it) because of the corona risk rather than the alcohol
Inside, just don't please
Fair
Nobody wants it
There was a single dorm room in clarke last year that called theirselves El KLub and they fit 36 people in like a 6x10 box
Big Bad
I do dislike germs tho and the pandemic has put me on an even higher alert
The fact that I want to be a ped nurse goes against everything I stand for rlly
Bc despite Chicago having a nice medical campus the unis don’t do much with it
I took a tour and couldn’t see it but the mention of it was enough lol
I'd love to go to case med but it do be competitve as fuck tho
“Can work under stress”
Apparently case gives its nurses TRIPLE the amount of clinical hours that ordinary programs do
Yes I never stopped screaming about that fact when I saw it
oh
Like bring ur child to work day except it’s not ur child and it’s for months
And they make you do work
Lowkey upset I have to do certifications all over again tho
and now i need to do it all over again
Yea I hate it
rip
Probably super important anymore
scary
I’ll take the experience in different fields n stuff but I’m dead set on what I’m doing
What makes you want to be a Peds Nurse
\
Didn’t see my fb intro rip
Even the annoying adolescents
if i see a child i automatically want to punt it into the sun
I’m the opposite I *hate* working with adults
Love children hate their parents
I hate people in general
Sometimes I think working as a health commissioner is cool but idk if nursing is a decent qualification
go into politics, they hate everyone
esp poor ppl
Oh if I did I would shut everyone down but I don’t wanna deal with idiots
after working retail for a year i refuse to work in a public service job again *ever*
I currently work retail
I hope to never work retail
But then again nursing can be a glorified customer service job sometimes
i just dont wanna work with the public
i hate the public and they hate me
Like ppl are stuck with the old image of nursing it’s sad
Yeah it is sad
They aren’t compensated enough imo
That’s what college is all about isn’t it?

The youths hate emails
They’re necessary tho

I want to go to Colorado so badly
I don't soke
@_lb18 Unfortunately I don't have an answer for you. Everything is very up in the air right now, and I'm not sure even if I will remain as the RA of Tyler 4. It's likely I will be moved somewhere else to distribute students better.
Except ohio
Just dont smoke in the room
ah wait won’t they need more ra’s cuz isn’t it one per floor but now there’s more floors being used for freshmen
i know ohio weed laws i don't wanna get the electric chair
Some like 40 year old dudes kept trying to get into sorority parties
Yeah its reallt really really really really bad
dont count ur chicken b4 they hatch
And kill us all

lyndhurst isn't rich ppl
but houses aren't
woah wtf
Still trying to find chicken to eat
i don’t wanna make a cover letter
i just want job
u can't rob a bank with your resume
No wonder ppl from there tend to hate going to case
what's wrong with case
case isnt the ghetto
yet
"I can't go around here because people will take my money" "I need a gun because the people will take my money" "I'm not safe because I'm rich and I wear hypebeast clothes"
"The bus drivers should be on time because I'm getting a degree and they're not so they should be serving me and doing their jobs"
it really is
and a whole lot of money
I think just by definition colleges can’t be in ghetto spaces
i wish i had a whole lot of money but i know my life would probably be fucked up
I don’t know any outside of my own
Last year during room checks somebody left 2 balenciaga shirts in the trash and I washed, dryed, and sold those fuckers
looting the lost and found bin at hs
and they dont care about it
so it gets sold
This year during Summer room checks somebody left studio beats behind
I went to CORN CITY PUBLIC ScHOOL
The student just bought the keurig while they were there and left it when they went back
So you were as likely to find the camshaft to a tractor as a bowie knife
He's very scary
I'm howling at my computer right now at your reactions
the red hat is the least of the problems here
I don’t like that it has fingers
I rlly don’t like that
yeah i would like it more without the arms
Is it’s nose just another bean?!
my city seems trash in comparison man
i wish we had a beanie
do you really :thonk:
I’ve never seen my mascot
our city is far to poor for that
FUCK NOOOO
umm dartmouth's mascot is fucking weed
isnt osu's weed as well
completely going back to cursed tho
idk we just did what the college board said
fair
they need to get into that embezzlement scheme somehow
Get that Disney money
rip
wouldnt have expected that much of a crowd
2 questions: Is the Bon Appetit on CWRU the same on I keep seeing on youtube and why does everyone hate it?
Fuck grubhub tho
its a service
The BA test kitchen channel isn’t paying ppl as equal as is wanted
oh dear
But cn is a shit company like that
Armark rip
are we talking overpriced or bad quality?
for college food it will be passable
but not really
They like the organic uwu stuff tho
Also it’s a college campus lol nothing is cheap
I guess i can understand the hate then
Smh grubhub tho
BA doesn’t have much to do with dining hall except providing food
Everything on Euclid seems okay, it’s college town after all its made for us
ope fair
Do you want us to?
Good bc I don’t have that type of computer knowledge and I don’t feel like googling it
I didn’t even notice ur pfp lol
i dont particulary care enough to do so
we went from trying to reopen mitchells to wondering "is loving jesus legal yet"
It’s my first time traveling 100% alone
IK imma get lost
if you manage to get lost nowadays
you must be trying to get lost
Nah I’m just bad at following directions
hate to say it ron, you dont really scream rebellious
But my point still stands I suck at following my gps
I’m disrespectful in the sad boring political way
Hard pass
wrong chat
"wrong chat"
Actually the epithet bonehead stuck around for so long that I can hardly remember his first nanr
It smells like grilling glizzies outside but there aren't any grills
Uh oh
ohh i just realized where this started from
Still don’t kno what a glizzie is
Urban Dictionary says it’s either a hot dog or a gun
Sounds like some redneck shit
usually the charcoal and the dead bugs in the wood burning
I've eaten bugs before, mama didn't raise a bitch
Would rather go vegan tho
some bugs need to be in the enviroment tho
dont eat bees
Usually not edible tho
Because I haven’t
thats all u need to kno
leave a posioned apple covered in dark coco
y'all aint never eaten bugs like this man
Not playing the video will assume the worst
Isn’t that a book or smth
Dude's just picking bugs left and right lmfao
gone
it's making me feel queasy
They added some sort of dairy to this buffalo sauce big sad
Some add dairy n some dont
Buffalo sauce is bad though
if its hot for the sake of being hot, shame
i like hot food, but it needs flavor
but it doesnt have flavor
My tastebuds are burning off I won’t taste it
It’s hard to seek out spice
have u tried siracha, its a different flavor, but it can add some small kick to food that otherwise doesnt have it
oh spice :3
Once again I just want the spice no flavor
Rip
i dont
slow
Rip usps
They need money
federal services do work from time to time
Them and the irs are so sad
yet we still have to pay taxes :angery:
you should try mobile ordering if you really want the ice shavings

CLE till I die
Still 2 many boomers
That was my phone

rip
thats a rip
ah, so you did end up going inside
someone wants me to use prohibited vernacular in general
Bro just fucking go for it, Sarah tries to be scary but sucks ass at it and you could get away with just about fucking everything
Except for ghost pings...
must feel bad adam
we won’t have to deal with him for another 90 years
shit
omg who will police the police
He doesn’t deserve to have the record for longest muted
well shit 😳
Oh
Sarah can you mute me for an even longer time? 😇
DON'T YOU DO IT
FUCK OFF
Oh shit
I will detonate it, don't test me 😡
i’m sorry julia but adam did the unspeakable
Just don’t unmute Adam
I can't have this
Okay guys, I'm sorry for what I'm about to do
?mute @spacemanboris longer than forever
he really did it
holy shit 😳
I'm back bitch
Why do I feel like Ben was about To leave the server
I’m already stupid and I know it
No u can’t call me stupid
Name him bobert sucks
HE LEFT
Jk don’t abuse ur powers
i think we seriously made adam not able to rejoin
it says we still have a mutual server

i don’t think he can come back
RIP 2020-2020

He got banned someone unban hin
Oh shiiiiit
i leave to play 1 game and everything has gone to shit
i cant take you guys anywhere
*trying*
he shouldnt have to create a new account due to something like this
i don’t know why it says he’s banned
everything bad is happening tonight
rip adam you will be remembered
you should be able to add most of them back
you also forgot to give me the admin role again
isnt that crackhead :thonk:
I'm sorry howdy
Good news everyone quarantine is no longer mandatory for me
So I don't have to waste 2 weeks
it's like they never existed

Oop I never considered night thoughts
As long as u remember that things go creek bc cold it’s fine

ok phone service go off
my grandma doesn't have a tv LMAO
rip
consistently heartbroken that i have to leave this lil lamb chop in michigan when i go to school
rip
michigan aint too far away if u go for a drive
damn ig we're all gonna die
yea, campus gets closed
and they want us out asap
so they can bath in the money
i don't understand why they're anticipating going completely remote for after thanksgiving when corona is a problem *now*
cuz
oh
@2waynice it's because they don't want a huge travel snaffu
They don't want people going back and forth
Admin is dumb and shoulda closed dorms and all in person classes like Princeton. But Admin is full of greedy people so here we are with half assed policies.
fair
all remote = this isn't fair this isn't what i'm paying for
all in person = the school doesn't care about our health and safety
blended = a little of both
Blended = school doesn’t care about our health and safety while overcharging me 🙂
Every student going to campus is willingly going, I don’t think it’s the school not caring about our healthy and safety
Though overcharging part, I mean, it’s private university and it’s a scam that we all buy into because they’re abusing their position of being the gateway to the upper class but that’s a separate issue
I mean, a smaller percentage of people are going because they can't return to their home countries or because their home life is not safe
Case charges very damn well near the sticker price of Ivies without the Ivy credential.
They could also be yours truly, who doesn't want to take east coast classes on a west coast time zone.
I feel that might not be a major issue as professors adapt and become more asynchronous to accommodate Chinese and Indian nationals staying at home.
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing would happen if necessary. For students over there, it's simply not fair to make them get up at crazy times
That’s what was happening in the early months. was pretty insane.
Oh shit, must be hard
cuz its really not for most
I mean it obviously isn’t if you go for a English major with no real career plan.
even if you are the dream major that is hot nowadays
it still requires alot of of work and alot of luck
I’m not dissing humanities majors. But I will diss them when they think they don’t need to plan for how they want to utilize their degree once they leave.
You need grad school to become employable
trade schools still have a price to em tho
*not nearly as much tho*
What if a premed doesn't get into med school? Does that happen?
would surpise me if it didnt tbh
And damn
But you just reapply the next cycle and attempt to fix your flaws
Is that for just one med school?
and this kids, is why we leave doctoring to other ppl
Average amount of school applications per applicant nationally is 16
Howdy, do you wanna be the IT guy for my plumbing business so we don't have to go to med school
Just an example of a bullshit essay at a medical school (UMiami)
i hate applying for any job like that cuz they want that fake divserity
Which is hopeful at some, worse chance at others
"i feel my skills are not diverse enough at this time, and I'm hoping this job will help divercify my abilities"
You spelled diversify wrong
Yeah homie embrace that phonetic shit
it does help i can ride the affirmative action train to the bank tho
its a fed work study job, if they are expecting alot, they are bound to be dissapointed
Lots of research positions can be work study.
shame
Still doesn’t change how I said it. Govt approved the rich area and boom, taken care of with 0 taxes and unlimited growth.
they get told they have to pay taxes still
end up being 0
due to the power of off shore accouts
Yeah. Shits dumb. Even being upper middle class can be financially stressful. I can’t even imagine how the lower socioeconomic tiers live.
kinda sucks
Like you’d qualify for govt programs and whatnot but it’ll never be enough to meet full needs.
Even in the Upper middle, a new car is bought once every 20 years or something. I’d say most of an upper middle class’ expendable money is usually spent on international travel.
I feel that seems a bit too tame for upper middle. that seems more like middle
planes kill the enviroment
Have the average ACT/SAT score at a school? AO’s think for way too long whether to accept you or not
Middle class? No FA even tho it’s needed
In conclusion, don’t be in the middle
I mean I find class everything to be null until you hit ~500k
Yea I don’t have the guts to go rural lol
I can’t go rural
Bruh 100k in Greater Cleveland is still really good
I also want to do Family Med or Internist
Travel nursing makes such good money but I don’t have it in me
Just gotta find a job that pays off loans overtime
Gotta drive home n pack rip
Le college
Ron’s packing just to repack
i haven't packed a galldarn thing
how much could u really need to pack, we're only going to be there for like a week
Yes bc I’m scared of le dark
you shouldnt be scared of the dark
Scared of what’s in it ik
you should be scared of whats IN the dark
im scared of james charles
Worst fear is James Charles being the monster under my bed
lmao he's worse than the bogeyman
Couldn’t even get a cool monster like the Loch Ness or whatevertf
oh. nerds
proper dave, gone so soon
aparently tennent and smith couldnt go anywhere during their runs
someone watched sherlock
mr benedict cumberbitch isn't ugly
Can’t think of a Sherlock show that ran better
Didn’t watch it rip
but he *doesn't* so
i think someone is in denail
That was a horrible scene to watch
do u guys think i’ll be able to get a work study job if my hair is pink 😳😳
ur dying ur hair?
i want to
but i know a lot of jobs like don’t allow you to
plus, im sure there is a job which would want ppl w/ bright hair
its school afterall
I’m so scared to get piercings n tats bc childrens hospital uwu
i think i shouldn’t be turned  away from american eagle bc i have a nose ring though😡😔
deadass that happened?
Honestly American eagle seems like the last place to do that sorta thing lol
nah i just used a generic store but i’ve been on many interviews that tell me i would have to remove it
bruh it’s DARK they won’t even see me
and usually the staff there are underpaid and dont gaf
I think they’d want you to work concessions
but idk what you applied for
im not allowed to have it at  my current job but since we wear masks>>>
ya I had a friend who worked in a theater and he hates them and popcorn now
i encourage everyone to get a nose ring
i didnt know there was a top and bottom of a face
Well yea you can’t get an eyebrow piercing
that’s fair
if u dont u gota weak bone syndrome
No bone piercings allowed yet
Can’t get a ring on ur bone
Unless u want to ig
i like my nose ring and that’s it
my face hurts just by looking at that
omg that looks so uncomfortable
See that’s just boring
Oh Fr dope
how do you like sleep on your side without metal um...like getting caught and also feeling very painful being pushed in
you dont sleep
you are in constant stabby pain
Bc of how close it is to bone
Oh lit
omg tongue holes freak me out
ppl that cut their tongue too
more power to u but omg i would die
nope
couldnt be me
this is how i stay away from heroin, i'd rather not get poked
Not enough to do phlebotomy tho that’s a lil too monotonous
Don’t need heroine just snort rocks
i find not stab > stab
macoists tho
I mean masochists don’t automatically like needles
Or physical pain for that matter
One time I was at this one medical camp thing and a phlebotomist was telling us about his job and he asked me to be part of his demonstration of how to look for veins on your arm and he saw mine and went “wow you have a big vein! Someone would wanna draw blood out of you all day!”
My veins are hard to find for no reason
That shampoo looks so familiar but I can’t rmbr the name
cuz it seems far too long
I still use it when I run out of my regular shampoo
I never even bothered with them they don’t seem to suit my hair type
I don’t think I own a single hair care product that doesn’t contain coconut lol
oof all my hair products don't have coconut @mootdoot
my hair hates coconut sm
I can’t use straight up coconut oil bc my hair hates oil with a passion but when it’s mixed in it’s nice
my leave in conditioner that had coconut powder
I don't use leave in conditioner anymore lol
I just leave some of my conditioner in my hair
Ughhh I want that
Ironically using water alone does not help refresh my hair
see, I normally use a shit ton of gel to style my hair
I am so scared to touch gel
and like, I don't want my hair relaxed
It’s the same for me tho, if I use my leave in the night before I can just refresh with water most of the time
Ugh man chemicals in hair products
ik it's the worst
tbh tho
It shouldn’t be so hard finding decent products
i've realized the way ur supposed to treat ur hair + skin is the same
I’m still working on my hair
b/c humectants draw water from the air into the skin/hair, to moisturize it ,and then emollients soften + smooth it so it's not rough/flaky and then occlusives trap in the moisture and seal everything off
Suggestions are still nice tho
just don't put too much crap on ur face or it'll freak out
I hate most fragrances anyway whoop whoop
oh dang
My sister just gives me serums and face masks that she doesn’t like anymore
please tell me u aren't
isnt vitamin c from oranges?
Oh oki
cold > hot
Oh gosh
That was close to what my mom did before I took over my hair
oh yikes
cold ice cream
there is something about cold pizza that really hits at 3am
I never do it the way I should
I don't do hot oil
My hair hates protein for no reason smh
oh wao
so it doesn't strip my hair as badly
Ugh I hate stripping shampoos
I went to a hair dresser once my hair felt so sad
The only way to go all natural is doing everything from scratch and I don’t have that patience lol
i draw the line at hairspray tho, no way in hell will I ever use hairspray
I used to use it for dance never again
but i need hold
I don’t need nearly as much
or maybe u need a softer hold
But the creams are working fine with me so I never experimented with them again
I never used to so much in the past
Bruh people with long hair can’t wash their hair everyday
It takes too long
I guess it depends on how greasy your hair gets
if i didn't i would feel greasy 1 day after not washing it
idk
i have combination skin tho
they need that oil
I’ve heard of it but I don’t know what it is
you should be able to download a pdf
Oh snap
I really need to get into the multimedia who
which given his reasons for leaving
is damn impressive
Lol did u think they stopped?
I mean look at the reviews for the last 2 seasons
Never did the super in superwholock rip
ok you never used tumblr then
Reviews don’t always run shows
why would i ever want to use tumblr :thonk:
so it's been bad for 23
fucking yank
So is the current dr leaving after the next season?
I don’t think so
i havent kept that much track tbh
it gets broken down
it's an INTERNET RULE
Was disappointed when she died
oh, warning raunak, some of the cgi from the earlier bits have not aged perfectly
God don’t get me started
its not terrible
some bit hold up still
i like to get mad as hell before neurosurgery
arent u a english major tho :thonk:
I haven’t
wasnt that much of a fan
But mostly due to access issues and not bc I didn’t wanna watch
Like if you want 4 people flying we have to know half of them already
only lately have they been breaking that human companion mold
Like the whole humanizing the doctor thing gets tanked with too many humans
spoilers ||timeless child storyline sucks, and u cant tell me otherwise||
Idk which one imdb is
the doctor isnt human tho
Well no like the whole idea of having humans is like “omg someone tell the doctor not to commit genocide”
But 4 of them one of them needs to be a murder to balance it out
Ofc I haven’t watched her run yet lol so idk their personalities but it’s like 4 people yelling not to kill must b annoying
Even tho I haven’t watched it lol
i feel it could do well
but the writing isnt there
Mickey and the other dude I can’t remember and rory kinda F
I mean Steven Moffat left the show with peter
And since then show has been shit
It’s still one run bc same doctor
So we can’t say they’re on a downhill until they possibly fuck up with another doctor
which we hope wont happen
Also the whole bbc fad died out when Sherlock stopped and Matt left
So there isn’t much hype anymore
bbc is still relavent in brit land, its just here in america it doesnt have that power as much
Even the view count fell pretty low with the current seasons
Tumblr got nerfed n superwholock died
i dont think they had much control over things
But I’ll eventually leave that too
the politics of reddit is auth left with a dash of anarchy
reddit is not great wtf
Great now I have the dr who theme  song stuck in my head
honestly throw the whole internet away
I just use reddit for manga n kpop n comics so I don’t get to see much of the politics
However I did search miles morales worst decision of my life
from 6 feet away
oh, the racism
kpop bad
Nah the fandom has been doing God's work by fighting trump lmao
i'll kill anyone who likes things i don't
cuz in the end its just the same noises over and over
Can’t see that photo rip
I just don’t do BTS or Blackpink or more mainstream things
Ugh dean is great
i hate when u say there's something wrong with something and someone's like "umm there's also things wrong with other things. so what"
You, Clouds, Rain is my fave
and Didn’t know me
Didn’t know meeee
*still not sure if any of this is english anymore tho*
I’m getting back into Zion T and his 2 albums sighhh
omg Bad Guys is rly good @mootdoot
this isn’t korean but I like Cigarettes After Sex too
idk what genre?
their music’s chill tho
atleast since i dont know context, it makes it v easy to get quotes
I’ve gotten into alt rap lately
I never ventured far into alt music
I haven’t
listen to it if u want
isnt nba that sportsball thing
I think I have some of his fts tho
Rip keyboard
i dont know if we can fix ur phone keyboard
zhanda stopped trying ig
I always say I’ll take a crack at old school rap then never do
so wrong sorry
Rip
Close

shame
Being old seems like a chore
too early?
I’ll probs die of natural causes before then if I play my cards right
oh
just smoke crack every single day and fuck anyone who says otherwise
die at 30
30 is good but I wouldn’t have enough money to die
Ok bc I was gna b sad
Smh the Mayan calendar is always telling us to die but when will we actually
they took all the deadness already
smh dying out due to smallpox
the only reason we dont have world wars is cuz nukes have made all the wars cold
i wonder if people were as annoying ab having to wear masks back then
they died out
and there was not nearly as much media coverage back then
Also boo disease we’re at War people
at my local meijer a 19 year old girl had a knife pulled on her for telling a guy he couldn't come in w/o a mask
dead?????
Can’t have anymore spreaders
The kids are working hard enough
cuz it gets clicks
My fav stories are the 3 billion ppl who are like “i didn’t believe Covid until I got sick 😔”
ppl do shit for attention
like that lady who coughed on tens of thousands of dollars of groceries
apparently she was a "known nuisance" in the area lmaoooo
But that girl can’t even be that old isn’t she like early 20s
Didn’t the packet in #food🍕 say it wasn’t going to be only grab n go
Bc ppl want horny jail
damnit i wanted a sleepover wit da bois
I’ve only ever used roll20 and voice chats
i want horny jail
it's no way near as fun 😦 i tried one night and it wasn't fun saying "cockgobbler" over zoom rather than in person
When the audio shorts and they just hear cock rip
rip
thats why you dont use a mic
i mean if im in class for zoom i'd rather say stuff rather than type
:/ the more they acquiesce the more likely we go home early
But I don't make the decisions
home is where the heart is
Need a new heart then
to probably a few weeks
GYms will be open tho
I mean it takes 2 weeks for incubation or whatever so we have at least until then
2 weeks
But testing won’t take place for another week
No I mean when ppl get sick from campus
even tho "no going into rooms"
i feel like getting it on in dorms which have paper thin walls is a no go for most
Like everyone gets sick second week sure but testing and stuff will take the week after then the rush of positives and possible hospitalizations week 4 they make a decision and we pack it up
we're selling ur shit
sucks to suck
if my dorm neighbor heard me moan i wouldn't be able to look them in the eye
and make eye contact
“He’s fucking too loud smh”
omg
u dont have a roomate tho
this semester tho
So I can fart all i want
@chandachan eat a bean burrito from chipotle or smth and let er rip
imma let some Freudian slips go during my sleep: fuck trump fuckkkkk
Oh we
Bad
i was in a religious class a couple weeks ago
and they were telling us the story abt some wife who got turned to stone b/c she cheated on her husband
Cheat code just don’t have a husband
and the guy telling it didn't actually say that she cheated
Damn smh
he's not wrong but
i feel like cheating isn't a mistake tho
Wdym oops I had sex with this other person who wasn’t u
"i slipped and fell on his dick" @mootdoot
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU SUCK DICK ON ACCIDENT
Rip vine
rip
Imagine if a parent happened to pop in
supposedly there are parents here
just talkin about jerkin off and shit
Actually it doesn’t even have to be legal lol ppl make stupid calls all the time why do I need a reason
I haven't either so I was curious
Hold on why wouldn’t case haven’t a plan for a large scale outbreak?
I mean numbers isn’t the issue
Everyone is doing numbers without violations
never leaving the house
Oof so ur alone in an apartment
i like being alone
does anyone else think "think beyond the possible" is corny as shit
like why do you need a tagline
cuz its trendy
I didn’t think schools ever had one til case
I can’t name the motto for any company or brand ever
"nerf or nothing"
Oh I forgot that one
That one doesn’t make much sense either tho
its either nerf
or its nothing
HYP: FUCK
cuz, you have to be atleast 5 to buy one at walmart
Idk what hyp mean there but I will assume it’s for “have you peed?”
I never knew Walmart sold guns but then again I live that big city life
There are they just don’t sell guns
Fair enough
I thought they’ve stopped selling them completely
Aw man I just remembered I’d have to wash my hair at not home
More reasons we should go home after a month
dont have hair
Air moves different at home tru
apparently it's a bonnet dryer
I don’t need the bonnet dryer if I’m not deep conditioning which I only do once a monthish
they could fit a whole fridge up there
Can’t do that rip
i mean, i dont se ehow it relates to hair
idk
My hair is combo 4c/b mostly c tho
A wash day runs me 4-5 hours
damn
cuz damn
Wash day is the longest part of my routine tho
My showers and changing are short asf ppl think I’m weird
But I don’t wear complicated stuff
sleeves are a no go, far too hot
I don’t like sweatpants bc it’s hard to make a good look out of them
Don’t see how tho
there is nothing like showing up 30min into class w/ a drink and sweats
> Nude beaches are great for self confidence or so they say
@mootdoot  id cry
and dont plan on checking back in
Then I’d cry
I didn’t care how I dressed in hs I didn’t give a fck about how people saw me
And I didn’t wanna impress anyone
One should tho
I dont think I djd
that seems p lame
was there really an edgewater virtual tour?
Don't hurt its feelings
I mean if u life more inland they don’t see beaches
nothing that u really need to tour xD
very sad for them
gone remember
Bad zhanda
No pp rip
tho i will say, the magic school bus episode of exploring the body is cool
dont count ur chickens b4 they hatch
Can’t escape it
Also I'm literally 10000 years old and I threw out my back while sleeping last night and now cannot work out or move very much
i've never seen a marvel movie so i have no frame of reference in regards to thanos as a character other than that he's.....like a bad guy
but i wasn’t sure if that was facts or not
you just lose some of the original art when it’s dubbed
the conjuring the devil made me do it type shit
Sorry for cursing, the devil gave me the heebie jeebies !
I think I read something and there’s like a day where a lot more cases get reported due to clerical things
people have been saying that for months tho at this point it's probably a negligible malefactor in reporting
Damn y'all northerners got this figured out
Though I heard Ohio broke the 100k barrier for cases
(no, it didnt make sense)
Big rip
oh damn
every other case daily headline is about someone dying
it cant be post
if its ***still*** happening
it didn't say anything ab covid in this obituary
i guess it would be inappropriate to list cause of death
No you can have ptsd while the event is still happening
Regardless of the circumstances surrounding his death, may he find eternal peace for God could not wait any longer to hand him the keys to heaven
Weather
far too hot
It’s supposed to storm or whatever today I think
its in the 90s, i'd like to die
Damn storms sucm
Rip I have no tact
cuz i woke up at noon 🙂
Fuck texas
nope
oh nvm
i forgot about this seerver
dont believe everything you read on the internet pri
for me qq -> sad face
It doesn’t look sad to me
cuz it kinda looks like 2 eyes with tears on the side
Oh!!
I just realized it a SPLIT SECOND before you sent that
wrong server oops
I'm sorry, upon arrival
Big sad
There do be a bad storm in Chicago rn
Rip the light post and tree outside my place
rip
i hope the tree didnt fall on anything
Rip
when are they going to reassign housing cause now i cant send anything i was going to ship
Did anyone buy all their textbooks yet
I need to holy crap
The amount of people selling books and stuff will probably be much lower tho
also i cant find anyone selling all the books i need used
so we dont get anything yet?
Idk abt y’all but for physics we had a list given to us last week and we need most of stuff the first week
> also do any of yall know when we can drop a class?
i didnt put biol 114 in my shopping cart but i was somehow enrolled
and I also have the AP credit so idk what happened
@hjk_2468 if you searched the class it is possible you just enrolled rather than going to the cart. Or, nursing could automatically be enrolled in it, idrk. @megmcmuffin22 answers?
i dont have to show up if im going to drop right...
Without any penalty. However, as a freshman you may use freshman forgiveness up until the last day of classes, and the class wiped from your transcript.
oh no i just need to drop biol 114
i want to take my ap bio credit
Find a GE to do
I guess I’m taking that next semester after Calc
Oh
I don’t know which stats I would take
But then again as a pre med I don’t know what math I take next semester
If you're swearing off math forever, 125/126
If ur a math genius
Oh really? I got credit for them though
Idk why they're named like that
And, if you're a math genius 123/124
Even though phys123 and 124 are pretty easy because the professor does hard content but grades suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper leniently
Like "Oh you tried and did some work, but didn't get the answer but you did a good half job...... 9.5/10"
that hurt
oh yikes 💀 @toomanyzs
anyone know why 500$ was taken off the list of tuition charges?
@sar.hh I'm in:
-CWRU Cooking Club
-Exec for Marching Band 
-Residence Life
-Campus Canines for a Cure
-I was a fencer (Club Fencing) but have since stopped 
-I do research
Being an RA takes up a lot of time tho
But I'm not part of any premed orgs because uh... well I don't want to warp your first impressions so figure out for yourselves
i hope the student organization fair thing is semi normal bc i feel like it’s hard to get an accurate impression by reading the things they post online😭
i dont think so
idk the difference between TA and SI
so it looks like some do some dont
maybe it’s bc my guy friend has work study? maybe he got a special gig
ooh, could be true, since work study is like a paid thing
I'm an SI next semester so I don't have any advice
what is an si tho?
LMAO i never learned the difference
typically SIs run sessions outside of the regular class, and don't work as closely with the professor as TAs do
Though it's different for the math department*
what class are u gonna be a SI for
Math 121 in the fall and 122 in the spring
ooo here you go math 121 boys
When he leaves I'm tryna take his job tho 👀
you've said much worse before
there aren’t any parents in here
but i guess you never really know
king is majoring in physics? mad respect
I have no clue I’m lost I just signed up for discover cle and other stuff
and there is an online job fair
but i think they’re just putting that in place of the whole week of stuff that we were supposed to have
essencially they cut the week up and stuffed it in 1 day
sad🥺😔
til*
*not anymore rip*
With events through the whole week
oh what
so we’re moving in during the week now since they trashed the discover week thing
makes sense... covid sucks😔😔
I mean most people were kicked off campus due to 'rona
It's not like we don't want to be here but we can't
i know this sucks
you dont want to be optimistic tho
RIGHT they look sick i’m so excited
they are supposed to stop the sick
sorry they look unsick
oh that’s such a good word i forgot existed
tight and sick are both such good words
sick rad and gnarly
like saying something is “fire” is okay but *sick* is a whole new level
Broooooooooooo! that was like totally sick dude!
totally sick
i’m trying to think of things i’ve heard fellow public school kids say
I'm finna Shit on yo lawb
*my life got flipped turned upside down*
night or nite i can’t remember if it was quirky spelling
anyways george lopez... my shit
maybe its cuz i havent watched as much tv as i used to, but newer shows just arent as good
i hear sharkboy and lavagirl are supposed to have a sequal
Nah I don't want to go for that route haha
cuz that state isnt banned
besides that, u can hope case doesnt add texas back or i guess u have to change that data
i wouldn’t be caught dead at a party rn
zhanda if u can’t go to cle or another state not on the list to quarantine soon... u might not be on campus 😔
oh dang
that was our last option
we cant be alone losers like hs, we have to be together losers
oh tru
it might not be too bad, maybe your professors will be okay with u missing the first 2 weeks of class but if we get sent home early it might be more trouble than it’s worth
seems more and more likely
School canceled
nothing but hell😔
school cancelled ?
no school isn’t cancelled beth is just joking
School is cancelled Sarah
Yeah if you don’t mind the stupid table my brother got
whats stupid about it?
I am scared
My brother can’t buy furniture
Don’t except my apartment to look like the four seasons
i only need the 1 season
Unfortunately
rip beth
I just need to get to target
I haven’t seen him in 5 months
I am scared
My parents are mad at him
why they mad
I can’t even control 3 year olds playing tennis
jesus beth i’m sorry u work with demons
Can’t
the rich are annoying
i'm technically sued and have a contract cuz i pissed off some rich kid
So basically I should work at Starbucks instead
rip
I kinda messed up tho
I forgot to get something so then I had to run to get it
oh no
And this girl took off her mask then forgot it
And I used hand sanitizer afterwards
My parents want me to go vegan
we got a 2liter of hand sanitzer at work
IDK
They have lost their mind
seems like it
I ain’t giving up lamb
*so, dont take beth to a petting zoo, or the lambs will end up as steaks*
couldnt be me
I just be really mad
fair xD
And it’s not because my apartment looks like shit
you cant pile a piss poor looking apartment w/ less than ideal foods
And guess what
Bye lamb
And guess what
I STILL ATE THEM WITH THE IMAGE IN MY HEAD
gotta nom nom b4 its gone
I want a lamb farm
But I guess I am vegan
I ate salmon today tho
Idk why they want me to be vegan
Someone Slater a lamb in the bibkele
So idk
so they want u to be a drunk vegan
Idk
I don’t drink
And then send a lot of it to family members and poor people
The smell tho
The blood
Cuz all that happens in our house
One of my friends almost went to the hospital for alcohol poisoning
So thus been sober since
Just don't drink lmfao
How hard is it to not touch alcohol
cant be drunk if u never drink
Don’t do alcohol kids
Don’t do drugs
but other alcohol doesnt taste much better
Yeah I mean I don’t really need alcohol
we're been trapped inside this cage for ages
CWRU food is bad too
and its only going to be worse this yr
cuz rona ruins everything
Campus will be sad tbh
I am legit stuck in my apartment
oh noes jenin
Idk about that Howdy lol
Ofc not at all
But I do be poor
Have a tight budget
ic, u doing work study?
I mean idk the modern def
Israel started with 30% and keeps taking in more
Cant do nothing when the dabkeh hits
Gaza is locked in tho
Fyi I don’t believe in a thing called “Israel “
Just trying to understand this
Isn’t Israel in the UN
Actually Israel has a bad covid outbreak
Just a stupid American
Oh so West Bank or Gaza
u know it bad when discord reconizes ur country but not the un
West Bank people gotta go to jordan (neighbor country) to travel through their airport
The Jordanian airport
It can take u an entire day to go to that airport
Oh same
weather be hot
more traffic
Sorry
could be, we got our fair share of druggies
bruh you don’t believ in israel?
if you don’t wanna believe in somethifn, it’s palestine
cuz technically it doesn’t exist
Yeah I won’t discuss
Forgot it’s name tho
the sears tower is cool to look at, never want to go up it
I also went to chicago last year
I WENT THERE
I never go downtown
they've really renovated the area
So Idk
Because it’s 30 mins away
Trains be dirty tho
I really don’t want to get mugged on the L
Driving in the city sucks
*when someone who reeks of weed rides the train*
the worst
No
The public one in-
Forgot the name of the street
Houston better than all these sorry citirw5
Cleveland sorry
I don’t want to drive through Gary
gary is a place even i dont dare tread
I never went to Austin but I heard it’s cool
London isn’t a country
Uk lad
Nope
Yea
Never went there tho
@addat  needs to leave then
RIP
Good night!
you dont want to rub ppl off
H town is not worth killing people for
Yea
That would hurt
So I am awake
CWRU students can’t have a convo
I have work at 9 am
Yeah I need to pack for college too
I have 3 so far
Got more to shop
I am wearing sunglasses on the plane
wear tons of ppe on the plane
u dont want to get sick on the plane
Corona can apparently get in your eye
mouth nose, eyes
u gotta wear everything on the way there so they dont charge u extra for luggage
We assumed that no one had corona cuz all were tested prior to travel
Didn’t you have to wear a mask tho
Did get it off in the new York airport
Idk
for me its cuz its the only school in ohio that isnt osu
But yet I am still at CWRU
Yeah I mean CWRU is not bad
It is just we hate it as it is a campus culture
far too much parties
Music programs be dope tho
when u get more money
no music this yr tho
Does it tho?
It was my dream school since I was 5
Yet I am at CWRU
I like CWRU tho
Since junior year for me :lmfno:
which attracks money
They don’t have the program I want
i'll be honest i dont have a dream school. I'd like to imagine if i was smart and got in somwhere that would set me for life
And they all went to my hs
Eyes falling asleep
LMAO FORGOT 
Go schleep
so it dont die tmmr
What is a dream school
Go tk sleep before greedy kruwgrt kills you
some ppl dont
Oh true I should because work
Sorry
> What is a dream school
@mootdoot  is a school that u wish u can go there but u know u won’t
Just never had one
dreaming? couldnt be me
We out here trying to get our education
fair
I only know one nursing student who hates it
I wouldn’t have heard about cwru if it wasn’t for bob’s ~~spam~~ emails
But she wanted to go to a state school
Oof I could never do U of I
Go to sleep
Yeah no one knows CWRU until like idk this year
I haven’t gotten where’s that
Illinois trash state tbh shoutout to Obama though
U not wrong
Ohio is a worse state
Made me mad
My Chicago pride isn’t blinding enough rip
Rip
Spring sorry
Keyboard hates u I get it
Sometimes I type so fast it activates swipe text and my shit gets messed up
Bears be bad
Damn
beth's that kid that u put to bed but keeps walking downstairs every 5 min for "water"
Hopefully Zach doesn't see this
so ppl can still add what they find good, but conversations dont happen in there
cuz we have some killers in there
Flying Spaghetti Monster gif apparently
and to end off this quotes insight
Just noticed 
Clock is still in cst mode
What the fuck
seems bout right
Fwiw NU was also my dream school and it was the only one I didn't get into
Can't stand snobby prep boys
~~will still have a tight budget tho~~
and if some bad shit happens, don't be afraid to reach out for help about that stuff, to your RA, or me. There's also the student emergency fund so if like your computer breaks, or a big unexpected medical bill, there is help with that stuff, don't worry
due to intrest
And I still have my senior year and then all of med school
~~Provided I get into med school~~
rip
@toomanyzs I got your back bro if you ever need help call me
The girl who shared the pic of the packed high school hallways says that she’s getting threats
RIP
my account balance went down by like more than 6k and i don't know why
case would *never*
Because you can’t come back to campus
Oh!
i did but i still can't tell what happened :/
They wouldn’t alter charges single v. double rooms though
You get charged for what you initially wanted
i just checked, mine still where it has been
idk but my aid hasn't been processed yet (which is insane bc school starts in 2 weeks)
i submitted fafsa and my css late
so it hasn't been processed yet, they said it should be done this week
would they really tho
Someone told me that they won’t
I’m stuck at home
But I’m too scared to call🥺
They’re already losing so much
they can lose more
they took away my grant money so they’re mean
gib money now
are they taking away scholarships@2
they tried snaking away work study
no it’s bc i won an outside scholarship and they sent it to the school... case was like “oh... this one scholarship means we can take away equal to that amount in grant money... so it’s basically like u gained nothing!!” :))
What the fuck
Sarah that sucks
> no it’s bc i won an outside scholarship and they sent it to the school... case was like “oh... this one scholarship means we can take away equal to that amount in grant money... so it’s basically like u gained nothing!!” :))
@sar.hh  I called and they told me if you get a scholarship they’ll just adjust
They shouldn’t take away a scholarship from you
it wasn’t a scholarship it was the CWRU grant
it seems like they'd be less likely to revoke grant money than scholarship money????
rip
so ppl dont have to die from college costs
If you get caught lying though then they bring down the hammer
they really do be greedy
then dont get caught 5head
its a HUGE PAIN
i have nothing for them to sue
the first year i went to school i used my moms info and she's broke as HELL and i didn't get asked for any more info (which would be my dads) and got huge refunds and the next year i did and got no refunds lmao
actually i got a check for $18
i have nothing to audit
at least case isn't like idk, nyu
they're rich and even if ur flat broke they're still gonna charge you like 25k
man this whole situation in general really blows
money isn’t real
there's no reason a president of a school should be taking home over 2 mil a year when the students barely have enough money for food
I REQUESTED PERMISSION FOR THE CLASS AND U HAVEN'T GIVEN ME IT PETER
rip
i'm so worried i'm not gonna be able to pay attention in online classes
like i need to be in in person classes so i have no distractions
even then if the professor is boring as all hell you'll probably just fall asleep anyways
It's going to be tough but college is not high school
You will miss important content and it wil bite you in the ass eventually
i'm also worried case classes are gonna be way more difficult than i'm anticipating
No, but I've taken physics
rip
There's also like my Ochem classes which were 4 tests, no homework, 100 points each, 90% is an A
have u taken any social science classes
How hard is ochem really
rip
I'm terrible at chemistry
i'm good at chemistry and i hate it
ochem is notoriously the weeder class for pre med students so
Lol Biochem is worse
i've heard physical chemistry is the absolute worst
Hats off to the biochem majors really
I don’t know how neuro is
Yeah see id fail in biochem
I like studying the brain
AP was not that bad
I was a neuro major originally but I would have to take a different stats class with the new major this year and that seems like a waste of tie
imma quickly skim through my ap bio and ap chem notes before I head off on that flight to cleveland
And it can be a difficult class
why do i have to take 3 physics classes for a math degree....idk
my worst nightmare
Well shit
I’ve done Calc and coding but probably nothing like that class
well technically you don't have to take any physics classes for a BA but i want a BS
biochem seems like it has a lot to do with neuro, the chemistry of the brain
you have to take physics too lmao there's so much shit u have to take ur never gonna use
That's not the emoji I wanted
rip
I suck at coding and computer science
i hate grinding can't i do NOTHING
I suck at everything
and then Med school is 40% acceptance across the board
Rip
the average med school acceptance rate is 5-8%
i'm at the end
oh
even the ones that aren't prestigious like...why are u guys doing this to yourself
rip
But they need to admit smart students
don't I also need to do community service and phsyician shadowing to go to med school
rip
fml
You need to do outside volunteering, hospital volunteering, shadowing, research, build relationships enough for 3 recc letters
My parents work in IT😌💅
guess I gotta somehow stand out enough from 300 other students in the same class
Ugh
I wish I was SMART SMHHHH
No one wants to b a nurse tho lol
I don’t know why though
i have no clue what I want to be tbh
Old habits die hard
Bootmun you tagged your roles as school of mediicine
SHH dont say anything bad ab nursing students
I’ve been told that nursing students suck but I don’t have the patience so I hope not
And got in or didn’t get in?
Oh
Just stay at the same school
CWRU is a ~T20 med school
The undergrad you go to is likely the med school you go to
People also make shit up
I just want to get into a med school to begin with
Even if I wanna work in Chicago
not sure about community service and physician shadowing due to corona tho
sigh
UGH IK
WTF DO I DO THIS SEMESTER
CRY?
I won’t even be on campus😌
rip
I really don't want to be doing physician shadowing while i'm having an mental breakdown over culture shock and etc
my dad recommended me to do the whole volunteering and shadowing during second year
since he's been through this whole process before
Soph year be terrible
How many years ago though
I have about 89 hours
And I’ll try to volunteer at my current hospital once they open up
I actually have 0 hospital volunteer hours but 300 non hospital
I think I'll do volunteer services once the whole corona thing goes away
I’m assuming hospital volunteering isn’t an option anymore
Totally ruins the vibes I wanted to volunteer at rainbow babies asap
I don't have anything to do this winter tbh
I wanted to go on a ski trip but rona might prevent me from doing that
i submitted a form but haven't heard back yet
Relax, I didn't apply to any PR
I don't like money math
It's a program, nvm if you don't know, I was just wondering
Oh snap
Doesn’t seem like anything super new
We got the not anymore thing I think Mag was talking about
this is intresting tho
my housing stuff hasn’t changed like julia is still my roommate and everything
I think everyone rushed the site rip housing page
Sorta feels like water in ur nose
don't mean to be picky but-
WE WANNA STAY ON THE SAME FLOOR
@toomanyzs my bad i completely misread it lmao
Plants vs zombies type shit
cuz the private schools are opening
You'd be really surprised howdy
Rip i hope Us doesn’t open Bc a couple kids got Covid already
*with how they are screwing over ppl left and right*
i think if students already have rona, they probably wont open
Actually rip
@howdy_. you went to Hawken?
ye, i work there
rip
warning to ur bro, hawken this yr is going to suck
PUBLIC SCHOOL GANG RISE😌😌😌
My sis went to HB for HS so it’s kinda hard to beat a better school than that in Cle
Like I went to solon so like it wasn’t good but wasn’t great either
Oh damn that’s far
i mean, its still in ohio
OSU is our only personality trait really
OSU still having their football games
Since half their school’s money comes from that
Like the tickets are being sold but the capacity of the stands is cut to 1/3
I ain’t going to OSU
I wanna leave cbus
does anyone really want to go to osu tho :thonk:
you ussually just end up there
Plus, once you have a degree from OSU, you’re stuck in Ohio
Plus I don’t wanna go to college with people from my hs
Since you see so many you know. But honestly it doesn’t matter all that much
But the last few years we’ve been sending more people to UC and Miami
see, you cant run into ppl u know from ur hs
if you dont know anyone from hs
Rip
thats last i heard tho
i havent heard anything about dayton tho
Ik one person going to Dayton to study oceanography
Dayton isn’t bad
But I don’t wanna go to Dayton, oh
dayton is the religious state school right
couldnt remember what
Can’t get an A? Can’t get a B? Go to tri C
Cuyahoga County Community college
Oh
Aw:(
Some of my friends that took classes there over the summer had the worst experiences there
tri c is a community college
if i didn't go to a community college i wouldn't be getting my scholarship lmao 🤙🏻
Fair
I think that Cleveland isn’t all that bad. People over exaggerate
I think it’s better than cbus but I don’t know yet
i lived in detroit for a time so cleveland doesnt scare me
I’m not scared in general
i havent been to detroit
but i've heard it hit hard there
i mean its like that in most areas, even tho cle has some very strong lines seperating the classes
i think that's a much bigger trend in midwestern "bad" cities for some reason

they say that when ur driving in gary at night you shouldn't stop completely  at stop signs
"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy." - kenobi on gary in
I take 90 to go to chicago, even if im almost out of fuel, u dont stop in gary
and since we're over here anyways
i switched to check something and didnt switch back
bc they do not want to be doxxed
howdy u honestly need the “”’s more than i do
i want them too
it hasnt been tested on humans
they havent even finished testing
oh damn
and watch it not work
idk putin does seem fishy lol
Yeah I think they just wanted to be first so badly that they cancelled a lot of regulations

i WANTED a pic of thanos like that w/h no purple phallus
One thing I love about these sturdy plastic trash cans is that when I'm feeling antsy I can kick the absolute shit out of them
This ain't a damn hotel
case doesn’t wanna give us more than they have to
case doesnt want to give us more anything then they have to
"Case doesn't do shit"
does it benefit us as freshmen tho
i'm getting a bathroom to myself i have nothing against case
cuz the motto is
some places tho have atleast human standards of living as freshmen
Great. Was just worried I'd need some extra handsoap
tulane is richboi school
wait arent some freshmen getting stuck in the village this year now
oh
i just wish the bathroom situation was better yaknow
but yea, the bathroom situation sucks
i don't like that ratio
i dont like ratios

i'm not even in ohio yet and i'm already so weary of hearing the ohio shit talk
too late
people in ohio already have it bad enough being in ohio without having to constantly hear about ohio
but ohio does have suck sometimes
other than the "hell" sign down near cincinatti
And we can’t forget about corn😌
this not anymore stuff is bullshit
it's so fucking long
Oops o forgot all about that
i wonder what happens if i dont do it
I don’t have enough money to bribe my sister again smh
i live 45 min from campus so its not too bad for me, but yeah
Cbus to cle isn’t a bad trip at all
2hrs yuh
i know columbus doesn't have a "thing" but does cleveland really have a thing either
columbus kinda reminds me of charlotte nc bc it's well populated and there's nothing there
She sometimes went there for work
shit
i think if anyone read over all my details i gave, someone would be able to legit find the street i live on
Someone brought up Clifford
And people wanted to see him
We will pay homage to the late beatles

Sorry some people might think we do drugs
I just realized the orientation meeting doesn't specify a link lmfaooo
Oh it should be on your wisr
We didnt receive emails for this, at least in my knowledge

Bye
sorry bois*
i just be scared to drop a bunch of money on an ipad and have it get lost ahsghshd
oh no i have a laptop too
Fuck*
i feel like we have sooo many channels though💀
Ok but college isn't gonna pay for itself 🤔
Being a sugar baby will be so easy now since you can’t meet old ppl in person
It’s the internet
howdy i didn’t want to BOTHER u
y’all i got that one toooooo idk how i feel about this
i wouldnt be bothered, i was doing remote setups in uc, so i would rather be doing anything else
Actually I won’t until there’s a nursing one
don’t u guys all basically take the same classes
Nope
i would much rather have discord groupchats than groupme ones 😔
Not willing to do the work tho
rip
you gotta be the change u wish to see ron
aren’t they all twin xl
it never said
But I don’t wanna deal with peoplereee
so u don’t have the responsibility
have meg do the dirty work lol
Sorta surprised that there isn’t one already
discord isnt that popular
I want it
i can't sleep in a mf twin xl bed
someone help i lost my brain cells
I had a kid who was 6'7 last year and he fit
how much extra room do you need my guy
sarah has the 300iq plans
No ghost just turned off the bed
i really don't know
please i need another identity i’m tired of this one
steal my identity i dont even want it
u dont want this one
something she's never had
Rip
short lung people
sarah is the big bad wolf ()_()
isnt a full size not that much larger tho :thonk:
there’s roll-around-room that’s all we need to know
Rip
now u just need to become a lawyer
Rip
cuz at the time of creation
Smh we’re not *that* bad
Anymore
i dont think la was as well established in the 30s
yea, if you compare it to chicago and nyc it wasnt on the same level at the time
Just realized I gotta leave my comics here
Big ouch
*also, its not a super far trip home if you really need em at some point*
but i've dont the reverse
*and then promptly forgot about checking out the book*
I mostly buy issues tho rip
But they got rid of late fees so it kinda doesn’t matter
but either will do in a pinch
I guess bc cook county is basically just Chicago we don’t have that
Oh shit
but most of the branches are either dingy or in the ghettos so its a bit hit or miss
i dont have much issue with em
Rip cpl branches are getting facelifts
and only makes u lose 17braincells a second
Esp if it’s due to “creative differences”
Yep :/. They said it wasn’t going how they expected which suuuks
uh oh 😬
I wasn’t expecting much anyway
idk if u guys saw the thing in announcements but check #classmate-meet for class gc’s
is groupme on pc aswell or do i need to have a phone?
I believe you need a phone?
It b on pc
i woulda thought it was only on phone too
it just seems like one of those apps yaknow
Ugh
i didnt do the rape bad ones yet
If they won’t go all the way then I will
For education purposes you can get away with anything
How many not anymore thingies are there in total
Here’s the thing though: sexual violence will still happen😔
Learn to accept they don’t want you
Already got that covered
I don’t wanna say boobies
Even if you wanted to b innocent just say chest
you didn’t know??
Oops guess i suck at English then
Rip
Oh
Ur brain hates it
My brain does hate it
Those r super perky tho
it probably wasnt and has some old english meaning, but its funny
Honestly I don’t understand why genitals are taboo
Ew this is worse than the module
rip ron
Never thought abt boobie sizes
big boobs want small boobs n vice versa
I don’t care about size at all
too late
And I don’t care about people’s opinions
ME WANT SOME
Except my teeth do be sensitive
Rip
rip
I’m sensitive about my hairline rip
I mean if they like flavors I don’t and there’s only space for one...
I don’t really pay attention to that
Fair
Aw man didn’t think abt that
Can’t win
Don’t date anyone
that sucks thne
Don’t compromise
Don’t settle for lesser flavors
All, I know that it seems annoying and a chore to do the sexual assault modules, but if you ignore it, and the bystander training, then you are part of a systemic issue. It seems harsh, but if you want to support survivors, and change the culture of campus, then you have to do your part, and that means education.
sorry 🥺
Rip
rip
Just some of the scenes are just ones you don’t normally watch on a daily basis
Still haven’t finished these questions lol
I don’t even know
Plenty of people have made negative comments, or discussed how're they're going to subvert it. And it's truly disappointing because that's a slap in the face to anybody who has gone through such terrible incidenct and I expected better out of all of you.
Zach, I’m not ignoring this. I’m sorry if I came off that way
I’m still doing it while paying attention
*dont put skittles in it tho like an animal*
So that they don’t blow it off
ppl wont blow it off, im p sure its required right
Like, “sexual assault sucks ok back to popcorn”
im trying to have 2 diff convos at once
That’s not what we were on tho
Ugh text is confusing
zach i don't mean to be condescending or rude in any way but the stuff in the module is common sense, and if you lack the very basis of treating another person like a human and not a sex object i don't think a module is going to fix that
It feels like common sense doesn’t it??
common sense aint common
that's the sad reality ig
Ppl who have that idea won’t change from a module
Makes more ppl aware tho
yeah it obviously isn’t when you look at pages like cwru survivors, so many people are so fucked up
Rip
cuz fb said it would cure rona
oh damn ron we on that same wavelength then my b
I mean I just started the module but if there isn’t a part talking about how to help someone affected I’d b real upset
Seems like an outside thing
i don't think it did... it did say however how to help someone who's had alcohol poisoning
rip, outside companies wont be clued into where they are needed most
ppl need education
There were case students tho
Rip
Clean everything
i keep trying to find cleaners
costco keeps running out
Don’t need cleaners if you ain’t coming 😎
and i can only steal so much from work
Clean ur room smh
TW: Sexual Violence
Neel, I get what you're saying about correcting sexual assault, but there are several points where I believe you err:
1. Bystander training like this can help prevent and actively stop Sexual Assault, such as knowing when somebody is being led away, or isolated. Sexual assault is not just rape, it is coercion, intoxication, isolation, manipulation, and many other things preceding any sort of sexual contact or content so that it is not enthusiastically consensual. I do believe that is important for people to know. 
2. Education like this is part of the fight to end victim blaming, and dispell myths about situations making somebody deserving of rape, which is never true. Being drunk, high, wearing a crop top, etc. NEVER makes you at fault for being the victim of assault, and too many people come to college with those opinions.
When it’s too late:(
It’s been too late
oh fuck my chicken
Rip
I don’t know
Oh
That’s why I asked if she wanted the literal definition
and shoot someone
Get a gun and feel a little too bold

Don’t know how they do it
Want to tried the famed fried butter but I don’t think I’d survive it
a country fair classic
sorry to interrupt the fried food convo
I don’t think it’s a scam
i just wasn’t sure if it’s something they try and sell u but it’ll like never be used
I was gna say bc pandemic you might want it
they seem to be sticking their fingers into our money
Still don’t think it’s that worth it
i don’t think it was ab the pandemic
i thought it was like “if u need to leave for medical issues or a family emergency and can’t complete the semester”
Might cover Covid tho
nope
Don’t need it then
Who needs insurance lmao
as far as i go
too late
listen ron u didn’t get into the deal
I feel like.....
The founding fathers didn’t want this
You known damn well old Ben was down for some freaky shit

I’m from Texas and idk if I should still pull up the 19th
@epi7844 Email the housing office for information
This shit so frustrating, I hAtE CaSes CoMmUnIcAtiOn SkIlLs
@epi7844 same I don't know if I can pull up 😔
I want to pull up
though I can't pull up
It has AC tho and dorms don't
That's definitely an option, but hotels are really expensive and I wish case didn't change the deadline to Aug 9th for full accommodation
Because they sent out an email on aug. 6 saying they wouldn't cover the costs for those moving to Ohio from an travel advisory state past aug. 0th
Okay so I couldn't find it, but the email had it being free for people way back on august 1st
How does that work
You can quarantine in a state that is not your home state, but isn't on the list
you can't move into the res halls
I'm sorry Zhanda, I know it sucks and it's really a wrench in the plan
It's only the federal work study program and potential changes to my financial aid that I'm worried a out
im living alone and a light is flickering
Also, has anyone gotten their OL’s and their zoom links? Because I haven’t
I'm very glad I wasn't fake news and that you can still come!!
@sprinkles2108 I haven’t gotten anything
Maybe they forgot lol
For the zoom links, housing has been slow in getting us the necessary info to create small groups (remote list, quarantine list, etc), so those groups aren’t created yet. Tonight’s meetings may get postponed to tomorrow, tbd
Does anyone know if Case will be providing Office 365 any time soon? I want to know if I should bother downloading Office 2019/2016 or LibreOffice instead to open powerpoint presentations and such more efficiently.
have you tried on the hub
Office 365 should be getting released on Friday in software center @syberkonda
I have gotten Nothing in preparation
oh i was hoping they'd have creative suite
oh it's creative cloud now
that's not bad at all
Wtf
Wrong chat sorry
But its really hard navigating discord s mobile interface so I often. Send messafes to the wrong server
We need to examine it
unless it gets really bad
Yeah most of my classes are online except bio but Bader is accommodating
And I have to switch to the online math 126
sigh
1640 was when pilgrims came tho right
Yo who wants to do thanos hulk roleplay
Is that jacket weather ?
all weather is jacket weather but you won't get weird looks when it's 45
Idk about the weather cause I haven’t been outside my flat
But zhanda don’t change the topic
cold > hot
either to clarke or to the room next door
His ass aint coming back
G o n e gone gone
Like he is not just gone
He gone gone gone gone
i haven’t gotten anything yet
Gone to the gone gone
I have to self quarantine in a nearvybhktel though
I don't know cwrunqurantine services contacted me this morning
It's gonna be boring as hell but I'm doing it for you guys
thanos isnt allowed in
Oh, were you asking me howdy?
gotta go down to the circle k for it tho
Right. Might be having some informal impromptu hangouts tho
I’m not an OL since I’m on orientation exec, but none of them know their groups yet
when’s the last day that ppl will have their room changed?
They're almost done, and have really tried to keep roommates together
i chose monday but haven’t gotten yet
I don't even know of it started or not lol
If Damn fucming lhone
I didn’t even get a link to it
If only my WiFi wasn’t blown out rn
WHY WONT MY DATA LOAD IT
It's being bad
I'll probably say hi for like 10 minutes (probably half an hour lol) and leave to test my broken bike pedal
I don’t even know if your link is the same for me
Stupid WiFi WONT LOAD MY PAGE
qq - so i didn't get an email or anything abt my orientation group b/c my email's not approved yet or whatever
STUPID ASS WIFI
well I can't get in rn anyway
I don’t even know if there are multiple meetings at the same time or not
this meeting is already shit
im leaving
I'm probs gonna leave
*oh*
Did y’all need a password
fair
idek yet
i just got a call like 5 hours ago and that's how i found out so
cuz like, ur gonna be stuck in 1 room for 2 weeks
i think they're still trying to find out when everyone is flying in through where etc.
rip
What’s the fucking passworddddd
im hoping they get back to me by tomorrow since my flight is monday
they wont work weekends
so friday has to be the last day
fuck is too much for pri
I NEED SOCIAL INTERACTION
we can't use it
i cant believe they would monitor chat
Everything is working EXCEPT FOR WISR
And i don’t have the zoom password
you need to login
I don’t know why it asked for a password
I wanted to request room 4 but I don’t know if I could’ve
Too late
rip
UGH
you cant switch?
WTF
What happened in the main room
Well I guess I'm no longer in it anymore
Goodbye
No I just was an idiot and closed the tab lol
rip xD
on my broken pedal
my bike broke and i do much about it rn
You can find the blink on wisr
No it isn’t what r y’all even doing
Unfortunately
but i cant be a true zoomer
So I guess small groups still aren't established yet?
Nope
This isn't the accounting people or anything. The OLs are fellow students who are doing what they can. Our housing department has been working until 11pm
Rip
Housing must’ve been so mad then lol
THat's a much needed step but is a huge math problem
Looks like they did it tho Taplin GroupMe seems satisfied
My sisters moving out so I get all of her leftover cleaning supplies
If they’re gonna work so hard to make sure freshmen stay on campus then I hope they would
hmm, even then seems like a strech
Case isn’t top?
The money will probably just go to making up the debt
and they probably never heard of it
It doesn’t have to go to the people
We just want a break ;-;
Won’t solve much tho
If I do that I don't graduate.
Smh college
As long as I don’t turn into howdy clone
Damn what went on in tyler house lmfao
someone had a blunt and they confiscated it probs
I DONT FEEL SAFE
"petty theft: copper pipe taken off building roof"
there's a few too many carjackings and window smashings in these reports for my liking
Not all medical transports due to alc get reported here. I've had at least 10 I can't find
> there's a few too many carjackings and window smashings in these reports for my liking
@2waynice wanna even push it to the next level?
WHY DID U GET THE WRONG IDEA
i would've had the same reaction tho
rip
all of the last messages were sent very late into the night
so i thought that the whole server would be dead
but then
SOMEONE
sent a messege
another person who woke up early
BASICALLY
i was happy that someone else has woke up early
i haven't gotten an email
but i also dunno if i stayed in the old room
but like I tried accessing it but I couldn't b/c my acc wasn't approved yet?
I think someone was asking about free office from Case?
it doesnt, international students is the last one shown
please send an email to FYEFP because they need to know so they can fix it!!!
Bruh even I don’t have it
cuz like aren’t there supposed to be a little bit of in person small group things
This reminds me of that one time my friend hosted a party and didn’t invite me and I found out about it the weekend after
are we supposed to know our OL and group yet or are we still waiting
I got mine last night
/early this morning
so some people have emails about their groups and some are still waiting
i wanna know mine already🥺😭😭
They’re working late
Gotta give it to them though they’re really trying to keep up
I got mine at 1:30
i just hope there’s nothing scheduled for tonight that i’m gonna miss ahegshhejd
I don't think there's anything scheduled for my group.
WHERE DID U GET UR INVITE
I HAVE NOT GOTTEN MINE YET
But when you ping yourself it doesn’t show under recent pings
I don’t even look at my recent pings
so if i haven't been assigned a suitemate at this point is it safe to assume i won't be getting one
i’m gonna cry
Aw luckyyy I don’t recognize anyone in my group rip
If only I could crash orientation groups like how I crashed that one break out room last night😳
i dont like myppl
idk anyone of them
idk anyone either 😭
I WISH WE COULD PICK GROUPS😭
Ugh
i want ppl ik so its less awk
My OL’s seem cool though
How many people are supposed to be in each group?
ron so close 😭😭
What the fuck
Apparently not
I’m sorry 😭😭 that sucks 🥺
People in group 69 must fell like kings n queens
They said they’re working on it
If you’re not in the group then you can’t do anything abt it
Padma you were sooo close to 69
ugh ok
and tbh - I don't like women's pjs, I don't feel comfy in them, I don't like the cut of them, it's just not it for me
Hate it here
I've worn nightgowns at home, I've worn pjs from the female section for 18 years of my life, I think I know what I want to wear when I wanna feel comfy
b/c at the end of the day, I'd rather wear men's clothes to bed because I just feel more comfy
And I told my dad "Dad if people are walking away from me because of what I'm wearing, then there's bigger issues than the supposed gender of my clothing"
but my dad literally HID my undershirts so that I couldn't find them because he just doesn't want me wearing them
and i'm really mad
God it’s never that serious
he was telling me earlier like "OH YOU'RE GONNA GET || RAPED|| IF YOU WEAR THAT SHIT"
like I said before I still intend on looking somewhat presentable in classes
drive a benz thru cleveland
and my dad's like "you don't understand"
35% accidentally hit the wrong answer whoopsie
Throw it away
but lord if I don't need some distance rn
Even if it’s a few weeks
i just need not to be around my family, and i'm sry if i'm being negative rn
seems too fake to be true
On the car heading off to the airport
Don't die!
For those of you who still don't have access to an invitation for the small-group orientation, the orientation director just sent me this message
http://prntscr.com/tztgwo
How did that happen...
Are all the orientations at 7? I didn’t get a specified time
I still can’t join either so idk if it matters now
I can’t get into my damn group wtf
This is mad stupid
its not 7pm yet
i guess so? dunno
I don’t think anything’s happening for now
Since groups aren’t all sorted out yet
im in rm 404, cuz it dont exist
or dont
cuz group work?
couldnt be me
idk my ppl emailed us
Oof I hope I’m not missing out on anything
Dude I can’t get into my group 😭
If you can’t get into your group don’t worry about it for now. Kathy is hard at work trying fix it
lmao rip im still in the waiting room
Can’t get into either group anyway
rip ron
Missing out on all that great *social interaction* 🤧
aw:(
Shame on u for not finding it
Nope
ok lemme fire up fb on my laptop
Didn’t kno my fervent love of 70% dark was likable
i cant find your post?
all i found was a ron (wont release last name)
well that profile didnt make a post
I’m serious tho if you just search in the fb group “Ron” but only look for posts containing the term and not users
I'm gonna join general vc for anyone who didnt get into the group wants social interaction still. Im on OL exec and dont have a group of my own so im free.
Oh I can’t join rn
it wouldnt be orientation without awkwardness
we have another call at 9 am tomorrow ugh
rip pri
i would die
sarah isnt
cuz she dont have any
somehow i don’t have any until like noon it’s so weird
late start  late end > early start late end
plus i mean, who wants to wake up at 9am on saturday
In a lounge waiting to board plane rn
early start early end is better than late start late end
when any of yall get jobs that will become immediately obvious
Apparently I arrive at ohare airport
7-7 shift doesn’t matter
Around 2 hours before my connecting flight
oh
oh
and it doesnt look like that
oh
Man I should get a deep dish before I leave
If there are any left
Beans closed
also, you would never make it there
in 2 hours
Downtowns closed after hours
There isn’t much around ohare so you have to go p far to get other things outside of deep dish
ohare is like a fucking mall u could probably kill 2 hours in there
But then again all malls suck
Don’t eat airport deep dish tho
They don’t put in the proper amount of tlc
dont eat airport food
or airport food in general?
oh
I can't believe this is my first time flying alone
Sigh
awww
And don't get rona
I hope I don't screw up somehow at the airport
he sold the airline to pay for college
sad but true
Airline fell on hard times with Ms. Rona
not miss rona BWAA
me at miss rona:
what airport is that? 👀
not like the usual brick shit house
Going from incheon airport to ohare airport is gonna feel like time travel
Jetlag never really gets me actually
a couple summers ago i went to california to visit family.... i'm from NJ so they're 3 hours behind
awful
i would never know
i've been on a plane zero times
and that wasnt very high up
it's really not
But can’t change continents without a plane
It’s bc ur doing it w the wrong ppl
i don't wanna be in the car with anyone for 6 hours
Worse than a plane with 200 people for 12 hours?
fair xD
Can’t leave a plane
I have to drive 9 hours tomorrow 😭
atleast in a car u can roll down a window
imagine how long it would take to drive there tho, you'd have to cross several oceans
if my parents make me drive..... it's over
Omg jet car
Except for ppl who want money
Can’t spend money on things people would like 😔
Poor people aren't real
Amtrak is great though. Just slow.
we really stopped improving our infrastructure in the mid 60s
so thats why everything is so slow
we havent updated or evolved much if any of it
My mom suggested Amtrak if I wanted to come home outside of break
i'm taking amtrak home for winter break
Here someone gives you a handcart and tells you to make your way home.
yeah sorry ron
1:45 am tho
there is delivery, but it seems to be closed
I want leutner at my friends house tho rip
there isn't shit for delivery on campus anyway
have you went down euclid man?
Fair enough
i dont know if case and gh+ would work together
yeah i mean who needs physical exercise
fair
I don’t think lol
i don't consider walking 10 minutes to get food decent physical exercise
i don't want the fukn meal plan lmao
i didn't get one
it should take from the meal plan tho
Can’t run
Bad knees
Bad body in general
rip ron
who needs the outdoors
i forgot if i said this but my apt buildings first floor has a poke bowl place and a cafe so freshman 15 boutta roll over to soph year

fair
DAMN DAMN DAMN

gna does seem hard to do
Idk a bit abt guys
Like according to the golden ratio or whatever our brains are supposed to like
That’s scary

Repairing bad pr

Time isn’t real
Incel cuz I don't want to throw thousands of dollars away
the lonely loner frees his mind at night headasssssss
Oh my

we haven't progressed past ass things
There isn't even a covid advisory for that product ?
oh nevermind
my cousin blew up a capri sun pouch with his breath and jumped on it and he literally died. respect the mf pouch
Rip
he didnt respec the pouch
damn this brings me back to the vine days 😔
this is what happens to those who dont respec 😔
Oh no!
Not worm on a string in a car!

Getting hit by a car driven by a worm on a string is the best way to go I think
What the actual fuck
@2waynice @howdy_. a i just wanted to update on my dad
b/c he's really pissed me off lmao
i just found out my dad decided to take those shirts with him to his hospital locker
which is impossible seeing as they were stored in the TRUNK of my mom's car
and u have to open that with the car keys
Don’t need a boba group when all of cwru are boba enthusiasts

cuz there is nothing they can do about it
I’m using this chance of not having to use my home address to buy Many Things that I shouldn’t buy
please dont buy anything illegal
Do I seem like the type
*no, but u never know*
yeah there's no way it's an accident, esp b/c my mom drove my dad to work today
and when I tried to say "no, once a week"
dont do that
Not even once a week oof
they were like "i won't pay your tuition for the next three months"
Call them when u need them
yeah, my parents don't think so
Being a legal adult means nothing to a lot of parents
Esp when ur going to college on their money
cuz the penalties are lessened
if you dont want to rock the boat
They can’t always get everything ukno
Even tho it feels like it sometimes lol
If they’re still paying my loans probably
cuz they do be collecting intrest
That one can be held over my head forever
he's in horny jail he can't
i can't i just got warned
does it detect innuendos tho
i didnt really put much effort into it
i can't think of anymore
suck to suck

^what I tell myself about bad website design
It's probably ok if you didn't go as a remote student
Oh
Sages profs who make synchronous classes at 8am est don't think I exist
i'm on a 24 hour woke cycle
you not awake? you a fake
Oh damn, homies got some sick rhymes
srsly tho how are synchronous classes gonna work for students who are like staying in china lmao
seems unfair to make them wake up at 5
Hawaii is the worst imp
rip the one kid from hawaii going to case getting fucked over by this set up
Cause it's like the dead zone when early birds and night owls are all asleep
it's apparently 3 in the virgin islands rn
honestly the fact that i don't even have to get out of bed to go to class has made the idea of 8 am classes almost bearable
every school is like the university of phoenix this year
You can sleep as late as you want, the sun would never come up in the winter
I often have to look into the light hole to make sure mine is working tho...
not if you can't see the mirror in the first place...
I'm trying to sleep
i fell asleep at 9 and woke up early
and also i'm leaving on sunday. nervous
I was expecting optimistic to say “I’m into that kinda shit” when zhanda told that he’ll whip him
@chandachan u forgot to say no homo
Morning guys. So I heard firefox is dying, which is unfortunate as I've used it nearly my entire life. What do ya'll recommend I switch to? Chrome or Edge?
Firefox has always been a struggle for me, but I’m sorry for your loss:(
It's not exactly dead, but with recent firing of hundreds of developers and dwindling power in the browser community its been on a slow decline
use pale moon if u still want firefox
oof rip firefox
sad
oh
aww dear world
i couldnt go to that bc i had cpr but my friends had fun
Thing do be slow here
omfg i want pizza
I don’t remember when
brb gotta throw away all my clothes
i never learned solitaire
Doesn’t feel nice
don’t u just make stacks
you cant get that offline
No pls don’t throw the cards
For some reason I cut it in diamonds
but i’m bad at it
fair
tho if you folded them
I’m raiding the kitchen before I leave
I drop my sister off at the airport tomorrow morning and then make my way over
For a study abroad
Surprised they’re still doing it
i want to bring all of my clothes
and i b nervous about having a work study job that requires like fancy clothes bc i’m only gonna bring like one fancy outfit
Oh man I forgot abt fancy clothes
I was going to but now I’m deep into packing
how much fancy could they really expect
DAMN
I wasn’t kidding when I said I bring a bag of snacc
stains everything red for hours
and no one gets hurt
i’m in the dead world thing😳 is it not just our orientation group omg
Dead world
that seems to be alot of ppl
u have the inside scoop of the dorm room
zip lining sounds scary
Aw it’s fun
The bus is right next to me but stopped for some reason
rip
hopefully it didnt break down
Is ti sweater weather already?
Don’t send me to horny jail pls
no where close
I wanted to bring out the sweatersss
This is so sad
Horrible
I will never be leaving my dorm
the dorms dont have ac tho
Man there’s not even a point in bringing a hoodie we’ll be out before it gets bad
Rip all my best fits require sweaters
It's already hot in chicago
thats how temps work
I need to brush up on conversions
and dont see it anywhere
Oh snap I didn’t think abt health insurance universal healthcare
im surprised you havent said anything about the cig smoke that is everywhere even tho its "banned"
My fav example of that is seeing people smoke outside a hospital
Ohare doesn't look too bad tho
Ye it’s an international airport we gotta keep up appearances
4 hours till my connecting flight
dont go to inside airport food
u gotta leave ohare
Too exhausted to be doing that
Rip
I’ve cracked the packing code
Oh shit I forgot I was saying smth
To not get the Big Sad
It’s working so far but my comic collection is staring at me with sad eyes
I am really not used to this whole tipping thing
that shit stays slappin
its still sugar
im gonna need @jojospaghettio to bring me choccy milk
The philly cheesesteak seems to be made on garlic bread
So it seems that you can rent a table for 45 mins in section 1,2, or 3, and pick up food from the different stations
The fuck
I've never seen a chicken gizzard
If you don't want food in your dorm
Or you want a sense of normalcy
and we dont got those
wrong layout
freshmen aren't the only ones eating at leutner
shame
There's still seniors, International students, nursing students, and about 200 people who were already here
Sometimes people don't have an option
*there isnt senior dorms*
nobody want to be stuck in those
I'm a junior currently stuck in one
And I will be as a senior if I don't die of covid
Keeps living spicy
I require nothing
Omg what
Also I talked to the director of health services and the current plan if there is an outbreak is a 2 week shelter in place because they don't want to send a bunch of covid people into the airports and busses and RTA
Also I got my covid test yesterday and that shit was uncomfortable af
God what am I bringing that I need 3 bags
I swear this wasn’t my original plan
tbh the greatest risk of why we go home early are people breaking the policies and procedures to keep covid away
i’m too afraid to go outside w/o my mask idk how kids are throwing parties without them
The risk assessment part of the brain don’t b fully developed
cuz
If I only have to leave my dorm like twice a week
No cap imma be bored as hell in the hotel room
well u still have classes
who needs those
Can’t go from nursing to compsci
I mean class of 2023 will be out of it
Lmao when it's our time to talk to '25 people we will be shitting on them over how bad we had it during quarantine
they also have it bad
Yea they got senior year rip
we gotta shit over '26 tho
couldnt be me
mfw I'm going to be in zoom medical school until 2024
you already has a single, howdy
Zach I’m bored rn. Do you have any more fun RA stories?
Time to never go to the doctor's office if they graduated between 20-28
Omg I didn’t even think abt who would check on quarantine students
If you get sick you get moved, and you get food, mental health care, UHS care, your navigator will help you with your classes, and a bunch more stff
Also if you guys get really sick and go to the hospital for non covid then email your navigator and they can make your professors give you extensions, profs themselves don't have to but they do if the navigator tells them to
College protip
F I worked so hard to find these
seriously
One is just snacks tho
I’m packing with the intention with never needing to buy anything
has anyone ever been to the mineanapolis airport?
There's a direct flight from there to seattle
I’m trying to do the math to see how long I can take a break before I go back to packing
Ew math
Bc the way I’m doing it is I’m adding everything on my original list, then taking out things that aren’t super necessary
Oh jeez
Making a separate list guarantees that I’ll miss something
Facts tho
God I wish I was in the hotel rn
Still ohare?
Still ohare
Still got around an hour left till boarding
Am bored
Damn I can't do the dear world meeting
Rip
It’s ok you’re not missing out
hard crust soft inside
not if you dont want to
Zhanda wtf
zhanda needs to have their deletion privileges revoked
I'm gonna hop on the pc hereafter :/
Phone keyboard sucks
ur pc keyboard aint much better
zhanda + typing = bad times
lol rip me
it looks like my roster has been finalized so I get to put up my door decs
But all is pretty bad
There isn't anything inside you that belongs in the shower
Okay after small eliminations, I still have 2 bags and a food bag
wasnt there also that chick that shat in there too
That wasn’t case
wtf
Yeah I feel bad for you guys because there really aren't that many rules but corona fucked everything up
Normally you're allowed to go wherever you want, whenever you want
rules wont be followed anyway
Man narrowing down my food is worse than narrowing down the other stuff
Watch out for that freshman 15 tho
need to keep the takis
oh of 3
Oh no
is it bigger on the inside tho
Wish it were
What I plan to do for my remote classes is to get dressed, put my laptop and stuff in my bookbag, and walk to where that class would normally be, then find a place to do class
jerky is p small tho
i be waking up about 2min b4 class
Ron I do not think you need this much food
you need more
doctors dont want u to know about
Don’t wanna leave if I don’t have to
fair
store everything in there
Never
Can’t leave that behind for my mom
Oh didn’t think of that
probably about 30 away and 45away from case
Been trying hard to convince le parents
But apparently it ruins the “college experience”
There’s not even anything to do on campus rn
more, we dont want our car to not be with us
given we need to go to work
Yea I didn’t wanna take any public transport
that are all closed
No just going back to Chicago without my parents knowing
That was my main reason for wanting a car
So they can’t track my movements
Go to Canada without your parents knowing:)
oh canada
Canada doesn’t want us
fair
what the fuck
shit in the shower and rub it all over the walls
Bad
Very bad
like that cant be sane behavior
this was last year
This is why I don’t want roommates
how many complaints could you possible need
the housing dept at her school sucked
worse than that
shit then spread
Shit smearing
Except
They aint boarding
but i forget idt anything scarred me as bad as the shit smearing
Shit smears are p bad
Might still be checking the plane
running late
Idk how it works but they might be attempting to clean
maybe someone smeared shit on the walls
Aw man I gotta go buy hair stuff
How long is the flight to Cleveland?
It's not a bad drive
Yeh it’s 5 hrs
Omg I want cruise control so bad:(
5 hours 28 mins so probably like 45 min, 1 hour flight?
doesnt every car have cruise control
unless its like an older car
idk when cruise control was invented
Unfortunately not, though the cars are like a decade old
i mean i like never use cruise control so
Traffic lol
I've only ever taken the train into chicago
So it rlly doesn’t matter
Oh chi
First class gets to board last
Cuz they’re in the front
And I didn't notice it
It’s never not busy
Near museum campus
And car stuff
Zach stop trying to scare us lol
Damn
They're all fuckig closed

Don’t have chem yet
I’d lowkey be upset if there was a spring sem
Doing all of this just to leave just to come back again for a reduced amt of time
If it doesn’t work the first time then don’t try again
Should’ve put dvd drive in laptop for dw
Laptop is just for zoom and YouTube
People in Physiology would take 3x less time than me to do their vids because they'd just be able to snip and clip the diagrams, and I hand drew all of the anatomy pieces and colored them
hardest bio class? Didn't miss a point from March forward
Oh this is Bio216, nurses don't ahve to take it
its a premed class
TIL that I do cornell notes, just not in the same layout
I didn’t know there was a name to what I did
how many dvd u got ron? an external dvd player that connects to a laptop can be a little as $10
I don't like to abbreviate things though

I found so many empty packs of fruit snacks in mine
I really forgot so many things

Aww everyone’s coming to Ohio nowwww
Then there’s me stuck in cbus
cbus is still ohio :P
I wanna leave cbus UGHHH
I feel so dumb rn
i can't find the lights on button
there should be a light switch near the door
I can't find a switch for these lamps
I tried inspecting them individually
there isnt a switch on the wall nearby for them?
nope
howdy did it get chilly chilly in cle last year in the fall
fair
apparently I need a case one card to retrieve mail
You get your cwru card when you check into your room, which means you need to get covid tested.
You don’t rlly need one do you?
I don’t know maybe not?
I guess so
Are the dining halls already open
They never closed did they?
oh tru
They had to feed those still on campus
Oh ye
Don’t get the kimchi tho it sucks
I've had too much bibimbap in korea
*for some reason i thought you were still off campus*
I havent had, indian flame, but i hear its decent
there is also jimmy johns, but i dont know how you feel about sandwiches
i can't be bothered to leave hotel
Guess i'm walking
Rip
quarentine cuz they dont want them to catch rona here
I haven’t had Kung fu tea since my stats exam ended
cant you just smell the trash :P
Euclid is the only street u need to know I think
The annoying curvy street?
This is so sad
But I have to leave tomorrow
God I wish I had a car rn
What's the point of having a license if I can't use it
the theoretical walk to class is longer
No it's that I want to drive to a walmart
Walmart is SHIT WDYM
you find that about an hour south in redneck country
Bad news guys
rip
Oh gosh
you might find something that catches ur eye
if you pass the used car dealer u've gone too far
i dont think they have delivery atm
or atleast last i checked
i've never had em
But i think i just ate diabetes
Cuz I just had coke
nope, its still just high fructose corn syrup
I missed a chance to eat plant based meat
rip
i generally dont want dry burgers
It was juicy tho
Only bones left
i dont know how it would work
cuz i've never moved faster than a light jog
Rly? I didn’t know streets existed in Cleveland 
I thought it was too boring to have streets
Didn't get to ask him
if there is a person who looks roughly college aged
Shiba dog
Rip
should've taken a pic
I wanted to give the dog a pat
isnt that the fully online one
Sigh
Computer it is
you should be able to get pbs or nick
yea, but they dont air those shows anymore
and all thats left is spongebob
Voice Actor dead RIP
i dont think so
tom kenny is still alive last i checked
the creator died tho
I’m vegetarian tho so biased opinion
Has the scooter craze hit Cleveland yet?
When I drove thru last week or 2 weeks ago or whoever I drove to my house to see where I gotta go
Time isn’t real
Wish I could borrow a cart so I can just haul all of my suitcases onto it
but i dont think they have the popularity as much as some other places
probably due to the weather conditions 99% of the year
Thinking that since I can’t bring a bike
its expensive tho
i guess ur getting ur walking feet moving
But now I feel the need to bring all my original snacks
i have to go freaking monday afternoon and i couldn't be more unhappy
*oh no*
Barbara Snyder will be missed
i just realized
nothing on craigslist, fb or any of the usual places?
It’s been like, 12 hours since I started packing
Nothing has changed
since tmw is my last day here
But it’s still two bags??
How did this happen??
STOP PACKING
I swear I haven’t added anything
Literally nothing has been added
And yet.
I feel that
I thought it wasn’t much
I forgot I needed like, sheets?
u need sheets
its far too hot for that
No need for blanket
I’m driving I only live like 4 hours away
I mean I’m not done, I can still get way worse
Oh yes for sure I didn’t realize how much stuff I had until I actually packed it all
And I have the mini confidence that comes with having family in the area, so if I need to store things there I can
Oh tru
Now that our roommates are gone
Already had a single rip
Even if I packed in full I doubt it would be enough to need another closet or drawer
I think the reason why stuff is taking up so much space is that they’re in their original packaging
Like once the boxes are gone it’ll be a lot easier to pack
Don’t know who’d need such things tho
Packing light to me is 1-2 bags but in reality what I need is 2-4
you need clothes
I have a ton of sweatshirts but the weather won’t get that cold by the time we leave
I don't want to have to do laundry because its going to be difficult and covidy so I brought more than normal
No cap i need to wash my undergarments cause them bad boys finna smell like must
With 6 shirts 6 bottoms you can last 2 weeks
never underwear
no it doesn't
It’s fine my skin already sucks
It’s the immigrant dream my parents dreamed of
Oh shit cleaning supplies
Never leave without it

Oh shit

Enormous novelty pencil from baseball hall of fame your dad gave you for college
Shit I haven't done mine

F I gave away the secret recipe
We won’t be doing anything like that
What I miss
Oh

i have to drive 9.5 hrs later today and have not slept
that sounds terrible
I’m sure you can just roll up to a testing center if you wanted to
You can get it but case wont accept
Me who can’t leave my flat reading this:

i’m bringing room decor bc i’m gonna get a work study job and i assume they would prolly let us stay on campus for that...maybe
i need moneys
i wonder if they cancel work study how that effects us
Yeah I hope they don’t
cuz it seems a bit suspect if they cancel it and are like hey, since u didnt do workstudy
same but i feel like since it’s from the gov. they can’t just like cancel it
i’m gonna make my room look a lil cute bc ik i’ll be sad if it looks like a prison

i’m gonna miss my pets😔
Awh I don’t have any
i think coco would run away
rip
Do you guys think they’ll send us home if it gets bad
2 weeks in someone shows rona symptoms
we then have to sit in quarentine fror 2 weeks
after which we will either have more cases or will "open up"
it cant infect you without consent
If we are gonna be quarantining off and on then I def gotta bring decorations so I don’t feel like I’m in an actual cell
All of my room decor are roughly the size of a piece of paper
Also I thought I did good with a suitcase and a duffle bag, but apparently my mom has 3 boxes full of stuff already in the car??
That’s good because I feel like with only those two bags you’d be missing a lot of stuff HAHAHAHA
Oh my hahaah
I mean I guess if I don’t need anything they can take it back with them
Omg i have a weighted blanket and it takes up an entire box
I forgot it’s like 20 pounds
Omg
@jj4153841 dude it’s sooo bad
Yeah I brought some hoodies and stuff just in case it does get cold earlier
I basically packed food as if I had to do a 2 weeks shelter in place anytime
HAHA it’s just gonna suck when we move out but oh well
I don’t wanna look like some diva
Omg
I left my heels at home
oh dang
Man I got a record player but didn’t buy any vinyls yet
So I’m leaving it
I’m taking one poster that’s smaller than a piece of paper and a work of art I did
There’s a white board in one of these boxes omg
I don’t think she got it when I said I’m packing necessities
*me sitting here wondering if i should really pack an extra pillow*
I have yet to find a pillow that doesn’t make my neck hurt
how does that make ur neck hurt ()_()
Everything’s a feels bad man
rip
I do not plan, I am bad at note taking
I require nothing for education
fair xD
Now it’s about to rain
its already raining over here
going to be raining til lik 5ish
the way i run kinda provides an umbrella for my shoes so they didn't get too terribly soaked
chafing hurts
plus, you can smell the air coming from miles away
Do you just have... bad posture?
the weather person said "the rain should be light and last for an hour"
no i don't run straight up because it's bad and ruins ur spine
I like playing in the rain
Like since 4th grade me thinks
the best way to not hurt ur back by running is to not run at all
Okay so I’m leaving for cle now
And I do not know how it happened
I'm so bored rn
I’ve been told that I cannot drive due to not sleeping
rip
for things to do in cleveland tho
everything be closed
i guess u could explore wade oval
But don’t worry my karaoke sucks u not missing much
it has weird hours tho so check me on that
@Deleted User I'mma just leave this video here
and there is no difference still :P
Yeah heard the fish still have aids too
*it could be worse
if you need to be walking and just need basic internet
if you need to be doing heavy internet stuff
Oh lit
does ur laptop have an ethernet port on it?
or do you need a usb -> ethernet adapter
pull up ur laptop
the hp spectre x360 doesnt have a full ethernet
But yea guess I need the adapter
Should’ve thought about this before I left rip
They still gotta come back with the actual laptop anyway lol
at near 40-60 dollars
im dead
case is such a rip off smh
dont buy anything in the "bookstore" unless you are truely desperate
That was the cheapest way to get everything though
the only thing i got from cwru's bookstore was 1 textbook (bc it was cheaper than amazon and i couldnt find it online), the bio lab access code cuz i couldnt find it elsewhere, and the iclicker shit
if you couldnt find it online, u werent looking hard enough, college textbooks are everywhere
too late oop
and how not to die
Cracked the system on scrubs tho
I only need the tops with the nursing patch
I used to plug them into the modem when my parents took away the internet at nightlmfa
dad told me to check out the bookstore for merch rip
I heard it’s closed
Rip
God I still feel so sleepy
Sorta got worried that my stuff wouldn’t be ready in time
Same lol I didn’t even noticed I slept off for like 30 minutes just now
90 miles away
Rip
The weather was so bad in Cleveland earlier.
It was awful around noon
Isn't it usually this bad?
It’s pretty bad normally
If it's terrible weather i'm already used to it thanks to good ole seattle
Now that I’m in Cleveland my only goal is to find howdy.
How close will I get 💀
the train aint that close
Let the gps and car do their thang after that
didn't he send an email about the textbooks
@howdy_. Calculus, Early Transcendentals 4th Edition by Rogawski, Adams and Franzosa
apparently it's the same for math 122 and math 123
I feel stupid for buying all of the textbooks
so I'm stuck with em now
never buy anything you dont have to
rip
mine tried
however, a thing i dont know
i don't think sages has textbooks
I hope I get the city infrastructure one tho
Though I should open up a pnc acc though
there's probably 100 legal guidelines that states why you shouldn't repair a crack in the road here
where do I go to make a fund tho
or well the bank you want to sign up for
I don’t turn 18 for another 4 months
I didn’t skip grades
rip
I wish I was 6ft 2
I want to be taller
everyone wishes they were 6ft
its a hard knock life
instead of getting obese
I’m 5’6 so im really smol
Except natural selection favors shorter girls
big sad
but fr tho, its mostly genetics
Honestly I’m tall for my parents
They ain’t that tall
but if ur parents are super short
u arent going to be an nba player
the rack does work
Uhhh my dad isn’t toooo short but my mom is short
My mom still wishes I was taller
I ain’t gonna find a guy if I’m taller
U SHORT
AND MY DAD AINT GIANT EITHER
rip
its a hard knock life for pri
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 5 ‘3 according to my mom
But still I’m short
my expected height was supposed to be around 6'1
cuz Instead of exercising during my growth spurt
like hell fat
My grandpa grew til he was 21
I guess I got my grandpa’s genes because I grew til this summer
Snagged that last half inch
Though now it says I’m 5’4 on my license😭
i'm a wide boi tho
Bootmun it’s never too late to get to your goal
My doctor thought I was anorexic though so rip
Even though I’m not
I don’t know man
I lost 60lbs by working out and eating less
I never paid attn to my percentile
Now I’m a tad skinny even tho I don’t see it
Weight doesn’t matter lol
It rlly doesn’t t
FUCK WEIGHT
Body comp matters so much more than your weight
Less fat moar muscle
I’ve never had americano
muscle, couldnt be me
wtf
Bootmun nothing
No don’t
Sadly that means I’m no longer a girl
Don’t fall for it
yeah @franklin5601 like i had to take a body fat test bc i had lost a lot of weight and my doc wasn't sure if it was muscle or if my metabolism magically sped up
Wth my doc didn’t make me do that
She’s still awesome though
She’s hella talkative though
Most doctors seems to be
All those years studying no time to party F
I guess so
its impossible to ever leave ohio
All I wanted was a burrito bowl and a lemonade
Rip
Oh same padma
Nope
Even forgot it was happening today lol
They didn’t send an email with a link soooooo
rip ur dinner
I made the stupid decision of ordering first cuz i've never been to a chipotle before
Fml
Damn people here are really patient when it comes to their food
whining doesnt make the line go fater
Bruh why is everything closed already
I just want fooood
Guess I’ll look and find a shake shack
its pretty close to my hotel but idk if its close to u
Still waiting
I should have just gone to bibibop instead
Not the kimchi tho
It’s like they just threw in the cabbage with the other stuff but didn’t let it sit
is really everything in uptown closed?
that doesnt seem right
I never liked shake shack
Just realized that if there’s only 2 shacks then that means we’re all in the same hotel or same area
Doubt many people would go that far out just to stay one night
or they just went down euclid, its not too terribly far
im surprised so much stuff downtown in fully closed
Yeah they suck
Givin people tickets and shit
fuck okay guess im not gonna invade a lot then
i aint paying for my damn parkin
I'll pray to Clifford that they don't hand measure it
they wouldnt hand measure it
Rip
@howdy_. it says I need permission and it won’t even prompt me to log in
oh sorry i meant my suitcase dimensions are 63.5'
its the weight ur gonna want to consider
i don’t think i’ve ever seen a person pull out the tape measure
Honestly they've never stuck mine in a box
the people there arent paid enough to care
aslong and it isnt egriogous
facts, like probably as long as it looks close enough to the normal size they’ll let it slip by
Would this qualify as an abnormally large suitcase or at least one that will draw the attention of the airport attendants
they probs wont care
they would be more worried about being tall prolly
but ur not on  a  plane
it’s fine though i just hate u forever now
and renaming me so much i left the server
@addat but i dont have notifications on
Alright so you guys move in tomorrow and I had to tell 5 people without masks on in a lobby to please go outside and put masks on so my hopes
how safe is beachwood like if i leave some stuff in the car overnight
Yo record each instance you spot them without a mask
leann, ur stuff aint getting broken into
unless u make it real fucking obsious u got valuables inside
cuz i saw on the group me someone got vandalized
you cant take shots
we need that mask gun
Idk it's tripping me because now all I can think is what if those are the first 5 covid cases
but now we need mask gun
I still want a Netflix party
kid cudi is from cleveland wtf
i have no art skills tho rip
I'm gonna get a projector. Put that shit on the side of a building so ppl can watch from their windows
they arent cheap, i've dont setups for them
That's not a bad idea
Can’t really wake up at 5am
I KNOW BUT IM NOT FINDING IT FOR SOME REASON
like, I saw it yesterday 
I don’t anymore
wish me luck
I hope I don't have rona
~~that me too was for the Rona thing~~
I don’t think it’s gonna be bad if one goes to freiberger
I wish I had a car
RIP
Why are u there so early?
But still!
30 mins to go ig
I’m 4 hours away 🐦
~~need 4 hours to reach Cleveland~~ 💀
I just woke up but I want to go back to sleep
And they want $$$
So if you commute ofc they’re gonna be *pissed*
Its like they’re mad I live too close to live on campus and wouldn’t monetarily make sense
Cause mine doesn’t say pm or am
Can’t wake at 6:30am
Ah shit
Sorry man
If you never sleep you never have to wake up
Fck time zones all my homies hate time zones
Welp apparently you’re supposed to REGISTER for your navigator group zoom call so I guess I’m not having mine today
Can’t you register now? There’s still 2 hours left
Nope
I can’t chug  coffee till 6am
I didn’t either priyanka hahaha
I registered for the one that had the least amount of spots left
I registered for the one for which I didn’t have to wake up at odd timings
Ugh
The testing isn't working lol
A printer broke
So for like 30 min we just got on line and the line didn't move
Is it the test where they go up your nose
It hurt? Great 😌😌😌
Joann it won’t hurt more than staying at home. Trust me 😔
I got that email but it still doesn’t let me in
So if we moved in today, anyone know what we’re supposed to do tomorrow? There’s nothing new on the schedule for those that have moved in
Just chill and explore I guess
I like the vending machines in the dorm tho
I need to go recieve a couple packages my dad ordered for me
Morning everyone. 3 hours in a 6 hour drive. How was drive through testing and getting stuff in dorms? Smooth and all?
Am exhausted
You never leave your room without it for the next 4 yeras
I'm bored rn
I already brought my parents so it’s capped at 2 people
I’m like an hour away but don’t move in until 2 but I’m in Clarke too!
i have a feeling that we’re all gonna need ice cream after this stressful day
I could kill for some icecream rn
Really?? Had no idea they limited their hours
I finiahed moving in
Isn’t mathers quad near weather head?
Ahh leave it it’s in person
@toomanyzs What purpose does quiet hours serve and how come they vary across weekdays
let people go to sleep or to study
Depending on how your floor is, quiet hours may mean little to nothing at all
Yeah the screaming in the common room last year woke me up once and I was extremely unhappy with everybody down there
except Tyler not Target
About to head down
Nope
Damn zhanda
Am hungry af
@whatpage15 it's not too bad
Yea I'm kinda scared for that
Don't be afraid
Oh no🥺
it's over really quickly
the covid test sucks
I forgot that I have residents now and I've been reading NYC Guido Voice tweets in that voice with my door open
idk i saw like meal times on the discover week schedule and i wasn’t sure if they were just letting us know or if they actually started on that day
The test felt so weird it didn’t really hurt me it just felt like I really needed to sneeze
It made my eyes water for like 10 mins
Felt like he got some brain on mine
Okay I just ate at otani
I can't get enough of it
I’m moving in rn!
because i decided to do that last minute
Just got tested damn it burns!
But yeah it’s not that bad for anyone else wondering the effects wear off pretty quickly
is it too late to sign up for discover week activities?
Boi I am exhausted
Gonna chill inside the dorm for now
Someone drove their van with a bike on top and tried to get into the garage
Sorry in just woke up lmao
It should be open already?
tho it was bad
felt like water up the nose
it felt worse than water up the nose i was like get out of my sinus pls
rip
they said ur eyes would water, but it was mostly my nose that started to run
i;ve already got a head injury
i managed to bang my head while standing up after closing the fridge
That makes it all the more easier for us to identify you: we just narrow the list of people down to those who have a sore bump on their heads
no suitemates so far
kinda assuming it's gonna stay that way since like ppl are already moving in but the building manager said i might get one
have u moved in yet Zhanda
not all bad
Rip to whoever that fam in the white BMW was
See I'm just sitting in my dorm not knowing what I'm supposed to do now lol
or really any of the spies?
well where in the room is it supposed to be
They though I'm in Cutler instead of cutter and gave me magnolia address
I literally cannot find. Juniper with all these one ways
my phone wont connect
Christian said you have to request an ethernet cable in MyHousing or something? I don’t know
Yes, you can move the furniture in your room as long as it doesn’t leave your room. 

For Ethernet, go to myhousing and submit a maintenance request to have your Ethernet activated. If you can’t find it, emailing Utech (help@case.edu) will do the same
(Like I got my computer to work but it keeps failing on my phone
everyone in downtown cleveland wants cigarettes
optimistic you look like the type of person to chain smoke and die of lung cancer at the age of 40
I just wanted to get ice cream
Where did it all go wrong
I have gone basically all over campus to try and change my room
rip
have u been to mitchells yet?
Immediately dive into the tired college student life
And it’s raining bruh
i havent left the building yet
I didn’t even look out the window yet lol
man i feel like i'm roaching lmao
zhanda u didnt bring detergent, rippp
I guess I could run a trip to some nearby store and buy a bottle
i think pods work in the machines
Didn’t check
i hate rain
I like rain
i got my disocver week pic taken in the pouring rain
it's like dummy firm like idk if i can get comfy enough to sleep on it firm @mootdoot i'm gonna need to invest into a good mattress topper
cuz the one i have was like 30 bucks
yea literally there's no comparison but the tempur pedic ones are like 300 bucks
I haven’t tried my bed yet
Gotta see if I like the bed first tho so don’t get ur hopes up
nothing fancy
fair
Hate pillows
i wouldnt say sleeping on the floor is annoying
the floor here aint clean
they need ur money for u to be considered
Man do they really shit on commuters
and the dude in wade commons seems to have never heard of the term
5 hours?
like 5 months ago
Oh dang
the lack of ac is slowly starting to kill me
with the reserve shooter pyro was crazy, but pyro still is only good at short ranges
well now i guess we play the week long waiting game till classes start
pyro is OP tho
and if you master degreaser + reserve shooter, you become an airblasting and killing god
Degreaser reserve is dog after the nerf
Plus flare is way too slow to hit sniper
Any of y’all feel bored af after moving in
Nope because I didn’t move in
Hahaha I’m sorry @sprinkles2108
But as of now you’re not missing much
Which is why I don’t feel too bad
Cause once you move in there’s no specific activity happening
go find your classes
i forgot her first name
and I forgot thre RCD's name
Athena was the assistant for my area last year
Tbh you won't really interact with her unless you seek her out, which is absolutely fine, and we encourage, or if you are a bad noodle
And if you're a really bad noodle you'll go talk to Dean of Students or the Student Conduct Office
there's over 120 people in my calc ii class :cursed_flushed:
asking questions during class will probably be impossible
Rip Sam
Guess who’s propped open door just shut and now they are locked out
The other is moving in tmrw
LOL literally couldn’t tell you
Me either
i just want to eat :cri:
Me too and none of my roomies want to yet
But I can't write the directions for it
Rip
Idek wtf Hitchcock is
rip
i was kicked out of leutner for not having a meal plan :cri: why can't i just pay with money
if u wanted dining hall food, u need a meal plan smh
no one told me u literally can't buy on campus food without a meal plan wtfffff
homies till we go eat Die Pferden aus Deutschland
can u still add money to a meal plan or is it like...too late
i feel so out of the loop smh
i've never heard of a campus dining hall that won't take money this is AMERICA
i went to leutner and got a gatorade
a lot of places ik aren't accepting cash
no they literally wouldn't let me in without a meal plan card
like they have a line going up the stairs to an entrance to the dining hall and i got turned away
Why what happened
Fat ripppp
Omg:(
50 bucks says 3 weeks
50 bucks we go home by the end of the day
exept zhanda hell still be in quarantine by the time we get home
I'mma have to endure 14 days of self-quarantine and then pack my belongings and head home
I’m kind of jealous of the people staying home at this point
Oh how the tables have turned
But I’m sorry guys:(
i would feel bad for internationals
rip
rip bootmun
well you still have time
Imagine if Case ends up with over 100+ positive tests from the drive through alone
@2waynice Do you want a meal plan? If you do, then you need to email housing and campus dining services
And we won’t know until days later
The hotel I'm quarantining in will be packed from head to toe
i don't i just wanna like be able to get food on campus at will
oh rip
there's already footage on the news at schools with people partying in close proximity without masks
kids r fuckin stupid
We do have the advantage that we're a relatively small school
rip OSU
and probably a more prudential body of students
y OSU about to get hit hard next week
rip ASU
Rip all big state schools
I feel bad for all of you, yet I feel kinda validated for my decision
Yeah at first I felt bad for freshmen staying home but turns out they probably will have a better time
I’m so sorry guys:( here’s a bigggg hug
To all the freshmen moving in
Yeah, you prolly won't see them much tho
The dining hall is closed now 💀
U won't find me
I'm in the math 126 tho
damn
10hours
Still needs some organization tho
Take your time there isn't too much else to do with all these restrictions lmao
But I’ll feel much more at ease when it’s completed
Unfortunately I didn’t pack my Lorna doones
Okay peeps. After just 3 hours of sleep I’m awake at 6:30am!
Rip
My legs r dead
so ron, should i head torward taplin main door
And nah I’m close to the side door so main door is optional
literally don't know what to do with myself from now til monday

Grammar b hard
fair
omg
Yeah I completely forgot tbh
i completely forgot ppl are moving in tomorrow too... u guys can go tomorrow and get it🙈
Yeah cause the closed common rooms sure isn't helping haha
someone in leutner tried to start a conversation with me and i was too scared
everyone who has a minifridge w/ freezer tho
and when she means short

you cant miss her
i love really short people bc our height difference always looks ridiculous
all im saying sarah, u might want some stilts :P
omg i've been dwarfed

we’re still doing icebreakers omfg ahsgdjshsh
Optimistic you shy for someone on all that ritalin

Aw man Sarah where are u
she's right outside taplin go accost
Oh man but I’m so comf in my room
i was outside but i went in bc it’s hard to do those orientation group ice breakers outside 😔
fr i was like this girl is outside having a whole ass conversation on the phone
I’m still in my room
who wants to do ice breakers in general let alone in a group vc
Breaking ice? couldnt be me
will probably never see these people in my life
I missed that memo
that's sleepy hours
Last move in was at 8
i want juice
ur not missing much
my man "jake" in this video really tried to pass plagiarism as a coincidence
mathematicians, question: if enough generations write enough lab papers, is there a point where you can't write an original enough paper to pass plagiarism checkers?
um i don't think within any reasonable amount of time
i think the verbiage and syntax is generally distinct enough to bypass plagiarism checkers even when the content is the same
biology studying photosynthesis
I fell like statistically there must be a point? thousands of years of generations?
i think bc the subject of science is constantly changing it wouldn't be that possible
How much is photosnythesis going to change tho
but also the levels of studying and explanation would be so varied that i dont think you can
Fair fair
That shit b open until 2 am
i only have so much money
Open til 3
i just want cookie
college students just want their cookies
I want insomnia cookies
Fair
i feel so dizzy😌😌
i'd go. shit i still like cookies
Y'all got GroupMes organizing things and the Clark one is dead lmao

You trying to break the ice optimistic
@chandachan tomorrow? i'm too shy tonight (as evinced by earlier)

Holy frick i'm so sleepy rn

The sages is probably taking so long this year since the university has been trying to work around COVID. We found out around the beginning of August last year for what sages class we got.
Also, Greek life this year will be weird. Idk if there even is rushing this semester with everything that’s going on
You won't know till u get to your sage class when classes start

You guys won't get the full experience
sad

and the bathrooms are still the bathrooms
Fair enough

Aleks is so much work
And it is weighted in such a way that if you don't do it you won't do well
Total shot in the dark but any of you guys have VR? Need some ping pong/minigolf competition
@toomanyzs is the Aleks work graded
if you don't do the work you won't do well in the class
Like for instance, a econ class I took where each homework was 1 point
and there were 400 points in the class
I still did it because I'm a simp for schoolwork
But I didn't have to per se
that seems
hard
Do your class in KSL
the one game that I actually do speedrunning and dumb shit on is The Complete Saga
I had it on wii and then I have it on PC now

Keyboard doesn't capture it as well

A lot of nursing students who have early clinicals study all night and then just bring pillows and blankets and sleep there

Bc I forgot that essential part on my buying

CaseGuest on my laptop isn’t too bad

i'm definitely gonna need to pick up some more t shirts and shit
There doesn’t seem to be many shooting places in the area
oh damn there's one in beachwood
they probably got the good shit
Oh snap
fr BUT goodwill typically catches wind and starts pricing the shit up
Someone thinks they're quite the comedian
i don't understand why everyone in those tents is playing music and singing and dancing that doesn't make me want to ask them questions
It will getcha where you need 2 be
And if it helps, the goodwill is just before hill crest hospital on mayfield road
Dunno man
For everyone who doesn’t know rta like that, use the app Moovit
If it doesn’t automatically set change the city to Cleveland and you can get directions anywhere and it shows you all the routes you can take both public and with Uber/Lyft

@chandachan I don't know the numbers, but nobody in my building thank god. @lookingforthegoldenlight Apparently as soon as a positive is confirmed they go and get them. No news is good news in terms of if you haven't heard back.
Yeah so it takes 24-36 hours to get a test done
Yeah I got tested on friday and didn't get my results until yesterday
But they quarantined people tested on monday early this morning
But this is v good because those positives were caught then they can't spread any more

I haven't really interacted with her much in a professional setting
honestly Skyler is such a nice name Im kinda sad i dont have her now
I hope we dont get those people here
heard somewhere that some people are calling those who don't wear masks rat lickers
I feel like there will be a division between people who don't wear masks to socialize and those who do
Sorry for making generalizations; I know not everyone falls along those 2 camps
Lol I will be regurgitated out of someone's throat
Only after being kept in their stomach for an entire day

I’m considering emailing profs to b like “hey I’m on shitty laptop pls excuse me for the week”
theyll probably say fuck u go to a computer lab
But I’m not computer nerd enough for that
i know that now
i didn't when i was 16
the fact so many companies were able to disguise them as anything else to schools is astonisthing
literally school don't gaf they buy them bc they're mad cheap and kids are stupid
Good for stupid kids
the hs i went to for freshman year gave out macbook pros and they ended up going way over budget on repairs and had to shut down the program the next year
rip
the next hs i went to i checked out like 5 hp laptops for my studio art class and ended up never giving them back DO NOT ask me the circumstances bc i don't remember
and you cant repair them
but i never heard shit ab it
ya cuz they're made of aluminum
but i still buy one bc i'm stupid
yeah don't get a helwett packard
Already got an hp
Mine working real nice tho
bru fat rip
But my Pc for gaming tho
i was the only person in my cs classes at my last school with a mac and people constantly gave me grief over it i was like shut UP
I require nothing from my laptop except YouTube and itch.io
Rn I have the 2015 MacBook Air so it’s bad
if i can get a new mac with a fat refund i'll do so
Don’t trust it’s flip joints
Howdy I won’t be able to attend cause it’ll be like way early morning for me
srsly case didn't think this thru
All my classes end by 12:30am
So not that bad
Damn
That’s certain near death
And the laptop wiggles
Like it’s just watch video upload work
i've woken up at 9 every day this week tho
imagine waking up at 6 for work in a few years
Work night shift
gen z gonna fail at life
Damn
if i could set my work schedule it would be from 6 to 2
Just don’t have a life
monday i have classes all fucking day
Thursday is my dead day
Yea I have nothing on Thursday whoop
I’ve given up on doin my scavenger hunt today, I am way too tired
I will simulate a day of never leaving my dorm and see how quick I go stir crazy
Guys how do we import the schedule to the calendar app of the phone
Idk
I don’t think there’s a way
Idk
I’m 17 rn. Can’t make life decisions. Brain be smol
nursing jobs aren't rlly ab connections as they are qualifications right
But bc I’m so deadset on pediatrics if they don’t do rotations at rainbow babies or smth then it’s useless for me
cutest childrens hospital name ever
Every other hospital has a name attached and it’s like ew I don’t wanna know abt who gave u the most money
i think that's only fair tbh
most "philanthropists" want to be recognized
Yea but if I don’t get a job at rainbow babies then I’m just going back to Chicago lol
> Guys how do we import the schedule to the calendar app of the phone
I know there's a way to download schedules from Canavs if your professor actually uses it
apparently mckinsey and deloitte chicago do scouting at case sooo :naenae:
company names i fell for
Lol my dream job is larabida childrens hospital
i know next to nothing tho
Oof idk lol
And their hospital is pretty
I wanted to wear a hoodie today smh
Any weather is sweater weather if ur not a coward
I’ve worn hoodies in 90s and didn’t die of heatstroke
Cos it's too coldddddd
Cold > hot
oh jesus christ is wolstein building closed this semester or something
What’s supposed to be there?
What u need?
i never got assigned a small group for orientation on my discover network :/
I waked to thwing only to find out they were closed too lol
Aw
I finally went through the work of cleaning up my homescreen
These emojis r killing me
Didn't someone go running at 12 am
I’m doing my hair so I’m not even going to leave today unless I get desperately hungry
No my legs r Dead
Yea it took her like 2 hours to get back to me when I messaged her
idk tho i'm very out of the loop
Oh nvm there’s another one today
my schedule says small group transfer orientation shit is happening today and tomorrow
idk
there's just so many mf events
It wasn’t terrible imo
I couldn’t access the north side forms for some reason
Sounds boring
And went from there
At least we didn’t have to move
I was trying hard not to fall asleep
But that can be cause I be sleepy 24/7
Go outside then smh
i just was i aint see no deer!!!
it's opening monday
Just walk into the woods if u want deer
Idk
is that good or bad
Wtf who makes an 18 inch pizza
I wish I could have one rn
Sigh
when covid took away free samps i was so sad 😦
Also I thought common rooms were closed
Ah I’m shit at smash
Also I’m so bad at fighting games I never bother to remember moves
Idk anxiety
And if ur feeling really spicy
i don't think we're daisy's type tbh
Also lol peach isn’t
I belive someone made a vid about the size of luigis dick
Oh gosh
Jk I can’t find it
If its twitter, was anything of value really lost
it just became refuge for the shitty side of tumblr and DA and whatever else closed down
Depends on the fandom tho
Nope
I honestly don’t watch that much anime anymore
Oh I just realized I’m facing hazel hi @2waynice
Tried to start dr. Stone but eh
Aot I lost after s2
Dr stone does feel kinda boring ye
The manga is long tho and the anime fucked up the second arc
Ah I can’t do bnha, personally I dont rlly like shows that try to do the classroom/slice of life themes
What keeps me reading is the varied quirks
I like the edginess of tg tbh rip
Moved to ajin though but that over I think
Yeah I couldn’t think of a better desc
I gotta be in the right headspace tho and it’s hard
that’s fair
Isn’t it getting revamped
I tried but couldn’t rlly do it rip
Hm idk
It’d be rlly hard to redo the whoooole thing
They’re doing it with Naruto but I don’t have it in me
Never even finished the anime
naruto is a way bigger franchise tho
Tg doesn’t have the same rep to justify
I thought abt starting naruto but hmmMMMmmm
I can’t get over the fillers
Oh Fr?
I only have like 30 eps left but I Can’t
Yea I mostly watch the fun reverse harems bc they’re so bad
oh I just rewatched s1 of vampire knight
Never againnnn
Isn’t it beautifully terrible
omg ew
Bc they stay open until 3am @kenobiow
My anime list is so shit but bc they’re so bad I like to watch them
A7, mitchells, Indian flame are the ones I went to so far that took it
I like the idea but hate nature
my password was too short so it said it was wrong
Bold of u to assume they are trying to protect our data
They’re protecting themselves from the horrors of my internet history
More suspect if they didn’t want that
My internet history has been basically only case stuff for the past week
There’s just so many sites
This is why I don’t go outside
They won’t sting u
They were trying to get my food 😠
Ne hungry elsewhere
You want them to staaaarve ?!
Aww
I just wanted to make sure I didn’t die of vitamin D deficiency
Aw man Halloween is ruined
aw
Forgot abt that
Idk do you still get candy?
Free candy will still happen
Lmao after middle school I just didn’t have the time
aww
Bc I’m busy dying in APs and hating myself bc I took calc soph yr
Don’t dress up just get candy
Gonna sit on the curb and hope they take me away
Nope
Just didn’t wear glasses that day
If I have to dress up it isn’t free candy anymore
I dont know what the grinch of halloween is
How hard is Clark Kent
Who do I know that’ll notice me gone lol
Oh dr
Bruh that cost money tho
Taking off glasses is 0 effort and I didn’t do class bc I couldn’t see
Omg I’ll go as my discord pfp this year
Ron, u cant tell me u dont have black clothes
No work
Made ppl upset
win some lose some
damn where you get that kind of money from optimistic
parlay wiring money to you ?
update: saag paneer is fucking bomb
I’m here bored with paneer
i mean it will probably be lame
Optimistic in person hunt will be longer
Although zoom one is kinda lame
oh sick
Nothing
it doesn't go by email it goes by address
Team work makes the dream work😤❤️
The cwru insta story has me dead
Yeah something needs to go
Bruh that chem class on Friday tho
That's what I'll probably give up because this semester we're likely going home early and so its not really worthit
i mean technically speaking u only need 15 credits a semester to graduate
15 a semester won't get you a minor though
And I need to finish this a bit early so I can start my MPH
i did the math and i should only have to take ab 17 a semester to finish my dual major degree
not too bad i think
don't overload with labs
i decided that the difference between a ba and a bs in math, professionally, is negligible, which saves me having to take a physics sequence and an additional physics class
and a higher level technical class
working in the health industry is something i've never been interested in, which is cool bc that's like 8 extra years of hard work 60+ hour workweeks and shoddy pay for most of it
but obviously i commend anyone who has the gall and drive to do so
I can't imagine being anything but
what do you want to specialize in?
if i was gonna go to med school i would definitely want to specialize in psychiatry
wtf lmaoo my dad makes vacuum pumps
He does a lot of car wrecks, construction workers, soldiers,
tho tbh there is a part of me that is like that
also deals with some sad stuff like the mental health side of Parkinsons
I can’t deal with sad things like that
I say as I want to go into peds
i'm really not bothered by things like that, i think it's just important to create an emotional barrier between yourself and the patient's situation, you can't help them much if you can't be objective about their health condition
i have a friend who's a hospice nurse and she told me she rarely goes a day without crying when she gets home
Why I can’t do neonates
i've never liked spaghetti
Noodles are hit or miss
don't ever google facial degloving
once I was bored and I googled dermoid ovarian cysts
Damn this heavy stuff
I don’t need gore in my daily life
I don’t have it in me to deal with the pressure of operating rooms
aw
I feel like working in surgery could be fun
u just have to REALLY know ur shit
i could barely handle working in a kitchen
so
and that was handling grilled wraps not organs
I hate dealing with adults
Hate adults
i hate working with kids and i also hate working with adults but i'd rather work with adults
i feel like when u start working with the elderly is when it gets depressing
I hate parents most of all
80% of them are pretty bad at their jobs
I'm honestly scared for if/when I get into med school, I start going on rotations
Dealing with kids who don’t speak bc their parents never let them at home piss me off
Don’t even get me start on some adoptive parents
ugh
I've heard things of foster parents taking money from the state
horrible
Yea foster money is for anything necessary for their childcare and then ppl jus, don’t do that
That’s not even the worst of tumblr
I haven’t touched tumblr since they nerfed all the boobies
there's definitely still boobs on tumblr
There’s only so many tho
No but then they risk getting taken off App Store
it's apple's fault really
if something bad happens it's either apple, google or amazon's fault
He wasn't that bad of a guy
isnt that the weather guy from the news
Guy who lost to Bush in 2000
would it be annoying to approach a professor ab research opportunities on the first day of class
they dont want to teach u anyways
they just want to go back to their research
Math research
Rip bro
oh no
feel free to do so, as long as it doesnt go out of hand :P
cuz
oh fukk i want that thing
> Y'all can be tracked down now
@Deleted User you can't even get into other dorms without a card so eh
gater has a thing for trying to track people down
isn't that like the best college in sk
dunno
let alone other companies
@Deleted User really? :o
@stuckinohiolads there's apparently a commuter lounge in thwing center
before moving in
if u didnt know
Okay i don't want to contract the virus from u
I won't come onv
oh yk
Nah not now it's late I'm back in my dorm lol
but i stayed there before moving in
for some reason I turned the temp up
I was there like 1-2 hrs ago
omg
Dude there's 10000 people u won't even lmao
I don't even know what street I'm on 🤡
they aint
nope
i dont see allowing a group of students to be sweating and heavy breathing over everything
i think i am late
You were still the life of the party though
@sike8752 u didn't miss too much but i would just reach out to ANTS and ask for an overview of what was covered in the meeting
apparently a friend of mine delivered some gifts to CWRU for me to pick up
I went to wade and i scanned my ID, and they said they didn't get any confirmation
i hope it wasnt theivoried
smh howdy and yet my keyboard sucks
SHAKING MY HEAD
zhanda, i tried to create a new word w/ thief and the past tense
hmm, if you look at the door did like ups leave their classic, "we missed you" sticker
like do they leave the packages
oh the dorm door?
I didn't see any packages but
im sure if it doesnt turn up someone can check the cameras
uh oh...
Idk?
Incidentally, I'm also kind of worried about having packages delivered on-campus
so idk how that gonna work
wtf
padma, if u dont get an email about the package by tomorrow
hopefully they just havent sorted it in wade yet
since there are so many packages coming in
@2waynice yeah the commuter lounge is closed for the semester sadly
I'm finna feel really good about myself after I destroy optimsitic in poker
and i haven't even played the game before
or assuming u win, optimistic is just that bad @chandachan
My day was great Zhanda, finally tested my modded car on the roads of CWRU and damn
i want that fukin projector
i left bc the music was annoying
ur gonna be disgraced and have to drop out from shame
watch both of u lose
hard
zhanda basically sharpen ur seppuku sword in preparation for how badly ur gonna lose
oh snap
privately to me we both agree u suck at poker and it would be useless to let u play
zhanda bout to lose before he even starts
shit*
oh dang
u didnt pray hard enough
I was cursing someone out
wow everyone in here is fukn boring
are these even real people wtf
Is the poker broken or...
I-is there actually a covid case already? Wtf
im last place lmfao
rip
@currynya They cannot due to HIPAA, but the RAs know if somebody is getting moved. I've just heard from RA friends about ppl
If they can contain it then it will be the end of an outbreak too
rip 3rd floor smith
i made a really stupid move at first and lost a lot but
are u out yet
damn
how many ppl were left
no one is out yet at this table
i think there are 4 left
I managed to only leave my dorm once and I didn’t cry so I’m super invincible
Bc being confined for long hours with only a screen for entertainment can b detrimental to mental health
Hippa just says you can’t disclose identity I’m p sure
hippo's tho
But it’s a valid public concern to know that someone in the area contracted in
so you can't say their room number
Yeah they can’t specify a dorm
And it’s general and doesn’t identify
But it goes thru upper admin I think so it’s more their call
I mean if there’s a case in Taplin they won’t email everyone, they’d only email those in actual close contact
Lol sorry
I thought we could cross play with the phone app
the phone works w pc
Idk dude I’m just saying what I’ve heard in other Unis
The public alert just goes out so ppl in the area are more cautious and have the information, even tho they don’t know location/identity specifics
I think it’s up to the uni but I could see them being obligated to report it but idk it’s more of an admin decision
For us it won’t be a public alert but a database u can check
They’ll still report it
But it won’t be like a text alert
ye I guess as long as it’s still public info that’s how they’re covered
Oh yeye they’ll do that
And that seems like the number to make ppl wanna go home
wish u were here
Sorry I just saw the pings @2waynice
i have no idea tbh, they're just gonna keep merging rooms until there's one person left
they're fucking in ear headphones so i stopped caring as soon as i found that out
stupid name but
dang pete bugs lost
oh no i checked on steam
zhanda i really wish we could go get mitchells rn
smh my head
trying to make me all in every time
i used to play zanga poker all the fucking time and i legitimately am pretty good but sometimes you just get a string of bad hands
fuck this bitch
dead president ass hoe
i'm gone :lmfno:
can't say i do
Some motherfucker went all in twice in a row the last two hands of my first round, won both of them, and left me with only 76
hard to hear but it's true
Literally just save up the extra money and go for something that'll last longer and sound better
however
HOWEVER
u could have sold the beats
i got added by someone else truth be told
Little Den Burger never caught slippin
What the fuck does that mean
are they still playing volleyball??
Well at least they shouldn’t scream smh
fucking lunatics
Alone
Evolution doesn’t move fast enough
jsyk the central air is literally motion activated and i can't change that setting
Damn that grumpy old man must be in my ass :so_hot:
The ac I’m my room gets too cold sometimes
i'm a fat whore so i'm going to get eurowafel
If I didn’t already change into pjs that would’ve sounded like a great idea
Smh what if I brought someone over
i can fucking hear them screaming at the taplin court from my apartment
really?
close the app?
it's slow and smoky
i'm sorry i'll plug my ears next time
i really wish class would just start
I’m bored
it's boring having nothing to do all day
It’s so boring when I ignore the orientation stuff
Did none of the main stuff today tho
these guys waiting for their waffle are talking about some dude bein on some gay shit
I feel like case doesn’t understand it’s user base enough
this shit gonna be melted when i get home lmao
tbh people need to stop using "gay" in vain or even to describe something disdainful because they just don't realize that the original meaning of the word stems from hate
just cant
I don't know why I'm messing with you so much tonight Optimistic
Boring
He wants to be rapunzeled
You need to save your ice crem
im halfway shes still alive
FUCK
Uh oh
Plus they cut the hours down to 25 this year
due to the whole covid fiasco
Night shift b hard
He needs to work on his parking tho
Should’ve sat n ate
It doesn't make any sense
zach u dont understand how deep my social phobia goes
but lowkey one time I called them at 9am because I was mega sick and I needed to get to class for a test
And they still came and got me
Aww
Still??
still
I’m waving but u can’t see me
u cant hear it???
If I roll my blinds up I’ll make eye contact with someone that’s terrifying
Not at fuckin 12am tho
sad
But I just don't have the time
Never thought abt that sport
Don’t u get tired when those games take forever
I don't know if I still have the velo for it though
I used to be able to get into the 80s but I bet I'm topping out low 70s high 60s
damn
But who needs to run when scooter exist
I want to do a short arm delivery but
Because I have long legs and arms but a small torso so I don't use my legs enough
I just get sad buzz then sick
Oh noice
@2waynice that sugar really got into your head for you to write effect instead of affect
I don’t get the hype of coffee in general
Coffee? Couldnt be me
tried it once i'm good
ok i change my mind the tap water isn't that bad
Can’t give lead water to the students
Still gna get their tuition money tho
i'm pleased with gretchen's performance so far
We miss Barack Obama
Not as much as others tho
But Chicago is a p bad shitstorm rn
what happen
Since everyone’s already admitted I guess
ah ye i saw that one someone else did an @ or maybe discord is messing up idk
Oh idk abt that one
oh noes
shit urself, ez
by the time it gets to that end it will have already digested and been synthesized into my blood stream DUMMY
But then imagine the sick rush ull get
u guys really want me to poop huh
Tho most sick is brown anyway
Shit puke and blood when it’s old enough
sick? are u fucking english
fair
Fair enough
Are they still playing volley? I have turned my fan back on
It’s past quiet hours wtf
"go the f to sleep"
they wont be able to tell who it is
It’s past quiet hours
I’m bored
i'm pissed they're being good looking and having friends past the hours designated in the local noise ordinance
Hi bored
I can yell tho to simulate the experience
Friends are hard dude
I don’t want to b a Karen about this
When u hear yelling from Taplin plz don’t tell on me
I’m really tempted to roll up my blinds
its LATE be QUIET
Some rain sounds for 10 hours
blast "soothing" rain sounds over a speaker
ron u didnt actually spot me did u
i've yet to be spotted :fingerguns:
omg no there is NO fucking way i can hear them screaming perfectly from my bed
I do not wish to be seen for the rest of the week
the jig is up, give up the 20kilos of coke and no one gets hurt
we need gold bars
the 3 ppl u want helping u rob a bank
Getaway car
getaway car
Howdy’s water broke?
dont put water in the freezer
hasnt broken yet :P
I had to mess with my fridge settings to make sure it wasn’t too hot or too cold
i turned mine off max cold and my ice cream started to melt
v annoying
I didn’t know if the higher number meant it was colder or warmer
rip
i dont know why my freezer dont like my ice cream
issss tooo early
im just sitting in my car until 8:30 now
ngl this is me when i find out theres now a huge line on the side of the tent i couldnt see
rip to the girl behind me
living on campus but moved in yesterday so she came for testing today and shes like halfway thru the line and this lady comes up and says u cant be here
oh damn
oh rip
she was wrong
can i just say case has done a horrible job with accessibility to zoom links to discover week events
one about to start and i literally can't figure out how to get there, checked everywhere
cause I don't have anything
Fuck more introductions
originally it was 9:30 but last minute our prof changed it to 9
that sucks
my roommate last year did that
I was telling my mom “u can’t shit on my packing choices, dude brought a whole real life gaming chair”
yea, i sat in one of those at a microsoft store
they suck alot
wont lie
i was expecting it to be so much worse from what everyone says
meg, thats a hole where things are supposed to go out, not in smh
so the zoom meeting was supposed to go from 9-10:30, and we barely made it 30min
no unfortunately, i put it on top and they just kinda said, f ur rankings and gave me some random bike one
I’m getting the book I need from the library
i've tried to find torrents for my textbooks to no avail
but half of my classes i can't find what textbooks i need
bc the b&n lookup isnt working for me
and i can't get a hold of b&n on the phone
the actual *book* books i've been able to get from the library
the eaccount thing isnt working, just says theres an issue with my campus transaction system
I dunno I just always kept track
we used to have an app but they took us off
idk
grub hub is used now but it never showed how many swipes were left
probably 8mb is my guess
i guess so
oh woops
people just don't fucking listen
i haven’t seen a person on campus without a mask yet i don’t think
that's less than a month away
I think I got invited to a second server from someone here w ppl looking for gym buddies and idk how thats gonna work tho lol
idn't they close Veale ?
Oh crap, there's the one fitness
Doing fitness together in small areas seems suspect
why cant ppl just talk on the fucking phone
I get that it’s hard bc everyone’s living together and ppl want typical college experiences but it’s so irresponsible and shitty
Atleast we arent rit with crowds up 2 300 without masks
2weeks?
omg u guys suck
Case won’t own it in a week
i dont want to drive home another 6 hours
yeah ppl don't want to adjust to change
So if that’s under control it doesn’t have to shut down but if ppl are meeting up without masks thennnnnn
I mean honestly it seems to be a good idea for the universities to get money for the housing then send folks home and only refund part
i didnt say it would be a week like u bitch
They arent going to refund ur money xD
There is no period tho
So it hasnt ended
Oh fuck
May they don’t have mercy on you
And ye sorry I was referring to that reddit thread
Don’t you have a job or smth
don't you have a kid or smth
Smh my head
Tired of old ppl telling me what to do
every college discussion board is basically dominated by parents
college confidential is just teenagers asking how to get into ivy league schools and parents telling them to fuck off
Ivys aren’t even as cool as they used to be
Bad ghost ping zhanda :angery:
oh crap
should work now
I want takis now qq
I guess
Lol aren’t we supposed to leave and not come back around thanksgiving
how we taking our finals then
We are Gone
NO bitch classes switch to online that doesnt mean we have to leave right then
They would prefer us to be checked out when we leave for break
Nah they don’t
Oh so you can just stay there the whole semester
Unless u decide not to leave for break tho feel free to stay
Missed it
fuck
Doesn't that start in 30 minutes?
Idk maybe different times
Diversity 360 is in 30 mins for me
Oh I did that yesterday
i fucking tripped and ripped the knee on my jeans
never leaving the house again
If someone was like “there’s been x cases in Taplin” then everyone in Taplin would wanna leave
It gets tricky when you want to get into specifics
i dont think we even have that
Speed is a different issue tho
if they wanted to do it quick and dirty
Yea but i doubt someone wants it quick n dirty lol
so the number isnt as large
Well cases can’t leave
for 2weeks
cases are stuck at case haha
didn't they say they're gonna send surveys everyday to all students to make sure they don't have any symptoms
Haven’t told us which is weird but eh
Says for employees tho
I’ve been doing it but I never would’ve known if not for my OL telling us
i didn't realize it was on rave. but I've been taking my temperature every day etc
just never leave ur room 5head
who needs to see the sun
I don’t need to see anyone
i wish i could not see the sun in my room tbh
can't no curtain rod
I thought I would need a blanket but the blinds are one way
Fair lol
Someone in Taplin really enjoys their ragtime
rip
Took me back to my youth
oop zeta psi is no longer a frat on campus
But since I don’t have a printer I’ll probably have to do it by ear
I have never gone south in my life
is it mobile friendly yet
idk about mobile
we need more than 3 anyways
you still playing though?
anyone want to play jackbox
Still won’t go on voice tho
oh it's supressed
Oh yeye
agario and kahoot can do as many people as you want
but the other two you need to know how many people are coming
do any of you know a single person that has working ethernet
Ethernet isn’t working here either even though the faceplate is activated either
Not working for me either
Dude can someone please for the love of god get me working Ethernet
I can't get you an ethernet
i'm so bored omg
or like talk to someone in your department
I find it astonishing that not a single person in freshman housing has working ethernet
utech needs to get their shit together
i feel like the majority of people in freshmen housing probably didn't bring a desktop
I know a bunch that brough either a gaming console or a laptop with an ethernet adapter
utech get your shit together smh
Kahoot wtf
I couldn't find it on campusfgroups
I brought my gaming PC
Been working on the Ethernet for over 5 hours though because it’s broke 😭
oh no wrong link
ok this is kind of stupid
lmao this is stupid
these people thought they had a chance....like it's almost sad
it's cwru trivia like a) i don't care and b) i don't care
@chandachan damn
im not even on the kahoot
Is virtual poker still happening?
"what time is the party"
"it was yesterday"
"oh ok, i don't think i'll go then"
I'm actually lagging wtf
my computer sucks
I can't even connect to the game 💀
Yea, thr internet here is not doing so hot
My stream keeps crashing on me qq
That's probably destroying your internet

And apparently it was someone’s birthday
Oh snap hbd
Cuz we might not even b on campus
Bad ppl

Ah shit @raunakwastaken
Anything not Juniper is old and small I guess @_the_intern_
I lived in Sherman last year. We only had ~4-5 people on the floor that could never clean up after themselves
Also no college kid can clean up after themselves
it was the only left to sign up for
No cap that person will be dead lmao

I seven the dog shit
i think quarentine has broke his brain
i guess it means he helps us with building stuff? idk but he was just real rude on the phone and i've been feeling attitude from him in every interaction
I eight the dog shit
0.1 deducted cause it wasn’t in order. There were texts in between
isnt that the thing about jokes?
i had considered that in my original score, it was long which hampered the execution due to interstitial unrelated messages
I signed up for nothing
Zhanda I left the one I had at 9 in between cause it was toooo boring
Lowkey the prisoner poetry event seems very engaging
I need to do this heart saver stuff so I intentionally didn’t sign up for anything
I’ve always wanted to do pen pals
Someone b my pen pal
Don’t wanna put in the work ic
death note
hes got a man on the inside
nope
never gotten around to it
Nope
shit was creepy as fuck
Isn’t that why the Steven penneywise dude is so popular
dont most ppl
ron no likey car killy everyone
I mean killing is fun
But fantasy killing is less so
I don’t need a clown when Chicago is full of them who don’t even put on the funny costume
no ron, bad
I thought we determined I don’t kno anything abt horror
more very stupid
smh my head
Smh my head
ron.......we can never be friends sorry
Bruh this simulation for cpr isn’t loading
Might throw this whole major away
I think it’s either the site or my bad bad shitty chromebook
Bc it’s not working on hotspot either
Well then that means there’s no solution and I won’t get this certificate I already have that they want me to get again for no reason
That would be horrible!
sometimes it do be but sometimes it do be but dont be
how is the club fair gonna work tomorrow....too many clubs to sit in on so many spiels
I thought it would work similar to the info fair, where it’s mostly sites with blurbs and you can join a chat or zoom if you want more info
apparently a big number of people drop out cuz it's a lot of work
u guys shoulda gone to the ccel meeting that just happened
Almost missed it bc I was getting pissed off at how the sim wasn’t loading
I need computer person to tell me which Ethernet cord to buy
someone*
Oh fr
uhhh idk how it works this year
High call volume rip
sometimes you just feel like killing
Is Ethernet faster and/or more reliable than wireless at Case? Last night I was having some serious issues with CaseWireless
They tell you it, but i dont thi k there is too much of a difference based on my tests
Doesnt mean it is qq
See I wouldn’t know cause I’m stay at home
Rip
on case's wifi webpages and app content seems to load instantly 90% of the time, which is fast enough for me
We aint so lucky
Same for me, but for some reason last night was really bad, maybe everybody was watching Netflix at the same time?
Wifi isnt the same across the board
I hope Case gets it shit together and fixed the internet issues before I come there
Smh my head
They aint
Sigh
@2waynice Orly? I seem to have missed that 😆
I need them for physics
Apparently
I was walking back from the Southside the other day and I saw 10 pennies on the ground but didn't pick them up unfortunately
Lab isn't till like Thursday I think
Also I need the Ethernet just to see if the tiny bit of speed with load this sim, hence why I only need it for a few days @howdy_.
lol i haven’t got the lab thing for 122 yet
When do we need the iolab device by ?
Probably whenever you have the lab but idk if you're in 121
Anyone tried delivering food to their dorm yet?
Nope
where u want me to leave it?
i cant exactly get into  taplin
If the wired network fails me I’ll cry in front of the nursing board and they’ll take pity on me
Also realized I should’ve given u some takis my bad
but that reminds me, i need to go get some
i forgot last time i left campus to grab a bag
cuz utech suc
but i dont know how long it will take
Wrong emijo
rip
So, after seing how the ol's and the discover cleveland events went
my movie night stuff seems much less bad
The only meaningful event that came out of today was the prison poetry service
Food will take 30 mins so I will sit and stare at the loading screen to the sounds of drumline for 15 of them
i got mine working
fuck how
i dont know if they are just overloaded at utech
but their service is lacking imo
They have hundreds of students trying to do different things in diff places
All pdfs I’ve seen so far have the wrong edition
You can take a chance on using an older edition if you want
Fuck
Someone in the 23 server said he took the class and they didn’t have a text book
So idk
So my Ethernet doesn’t work either, spent like 6hrs so far on it
They got the panel activated and my computer is all registered etc but still have the saying that “unidentifiable network”
Yeah alrdy did all of that and tech desk just said ok we are going to send someone to your dorm and figure it out (I requested this) Bc it’s no longer a software problem ig
Have you tried another cable?
Plugged my laptop into it
Still didn’t work
Oh god who didn’t flush the toilet in Taplin
Have you used wired with your laptop before?
@theking18 sorry for not being that helpful
I think a wireless connection would suffice for now and you can always reopen the issue during the school year
Yea I mean howdy was saying that the speeds don’t seem to be that much
The speed difference between wireless and cable should not make that much of a difference for school purposes; but take that with a grain of salt because I habe yet to use case wireless and people reputedly say it's shit
I did a test like on Wednesday on laptop and got 300downoaod 200uplod
My phone is slower
My gaming PC needs Ethernet to play games lol I don’t have a WiFi module in it
Yeah I tried wired on it it didn’t work
Means the wall unit for Ethernet needs to be fixed ig
Have u tried the other unit? If there is one
I don’t have access to one lol prob need to request that
There’s like a box mounted on the wall it isn’t like a normal Ethernet plate integrated
haha I was about to reward you with in-server currency but then I realized I was on the wrong server
Howdy I didn't know this server cooperated with utech 💀 💀
Utech and UGen have been losing people all summer and there is a hiring freeze, so when 2k people came to campus and brought their problems with them, they've been super overloaded
They work over summer?
Yeah, they work to fix all the broken shit and upgrade things and install things and still take calls from researchers and profs and students and stuff
They have a lot of work and are critically understaffed
The department is supposed to have 15
He's the one that goes out on the calls to fix things
Can they not apply for work study/part time jobs
Bc I didn’t see any jobs for it in handshake
There's a guy I've been seeing walking around and he never ever has a mask and is always way to close to groups of girls all the time
Also zach, where would one go to apply to work at utech
Bad!
Preferably hardware, but i can work with both
if ur not a clown ill be sad
sorry
Can’t get em correct if u never show em
i just passed out for 2.5 hours which is the perfect amount of time to wake up groggy as fuck and depressed
1 hour is sweet spot any more and it’s the worst
i know this and yet the idea of a <1 hr nap is crazy to me like...i'm gonna wake up and be like "no i'm not done" and go right back to sleep
But any more than an hour and I’m pissed
I cant sing
Can’t beat box but will hit table y’all can have 8 bars each

Died bc typing b hard
neel why cant you simp over me? give me money
we can't simp for each other
And a dog
I think that’s a kink isn’t it
Haven’t even met my hair yet
Well it’s still good karma bc ur doing something someone else likes
ya they get off on seeing the money leave their bank account
Isn’t that bad?
Or maybe I’m smol brain and don’t get it
u ppl know nothing about the internet
Smh no get money outta it
But that can’t buy ur textbooks
I have enough money to survive for now
The for now is a scary add on
I can’t be abusive
I literally can’t
I’ll yell at someone or be mean and then apologize
Even if they were in the wrong
I'm going to die of emails
The only person I don’t feel bad for yelling at is my sister
Rip Zach

The office which the OL's work out of
Zhanda did they give you a covid test? I heard they're releasing ppl early if they are negative
honestly alert the server cause this gonna be bigger than tyson v. mayweather @chandachan
im fukn stupid
Mayweather can't take hits, and he relies on his defense too much. Iron mike was an unstoppable force
Rip
Fuck that
People saw the email from the Dean of Students. If you can't follow anti covid shit and are gonna be a public health menace then you can get the hell off of this campus and quit endangering your classmates
Damn some literature person is gonna write a Zhanda x Gater fanfic
Hey what's that supposed to mean @2waynice
That's even worse
Also the noises outside of clarke tower isn't helping

bootmun they wont be bothering u anymore
I swear to god if cwru makes it to the news cuz of this
Imma just bury my head in the sand
i mean i saw quite a lot of females gathering in large groups like dumbasses. but apparently i'm being "sexist"
What happened to em
I just called someone for you
literally like these kids can't appreciate that we're in the middle of a pandemic and at very serious risk of being sent home
I don’t like snitching but I don’t want to do a semester at home
Or go knock on your RA's door
Do you have your phone on you

It did not work at all
Oh shoot sorry

I wouldn’t say half of my list wasn’t there

optimistic really liking cunts out here
couldnt even hold his horses
k this dude sent me a link for a meeting at 1 that turned out to be invalid and then they sent another link and i've been waiting 10 minutes for it to start and it hasn't
basically nothing u wouldnt find out if u signed up
Also I figured it out they're apparrbtly still deciding when to have the soccer practices bc of covid
i dont like that
OMG right . I literally didn't believe zhanda was her name at first lmao
Soccer isn’t a sport is it?
talking all this mess but you dont feel like pulling up smh
WHEN I LEAVE

Ok so how do we actually join the group now that the fair has ended ..

@Deleted User all the groups should still exist well after the fair and it shouldn't preclude current or future membership
My hand is stuck in the sink can you help me :so_hot:
@Deleted User you mad sus
Imagine still being in 23rd and having your summer holiday
Couldn’t be me
Bruh I just finished all my not anymore modules and the academic integrity one

Shit
Do it now. It won’t take you more than 5 mins to do it
Managed to finish my certifications before my slot ended yuhhhh
Oh
I'm trying to buy opinions for gater
Hug pugs, don’t do drugs.
If yall are serious honestly leave the university
dont joke about this stuff please
Are you fucking serious please do not buy opioids
Did you not do the fucking modules
Sorry I was actually doing the Opioids module and I just brought up the drug names I saw on-screen
@matt_owo don't worry I would never even lay an eye on drugs/alcohol
Some people at case really get in to some wack shit
I swear I dont do drugs lol
I haven't known any personally but heard plenty of stories
I think we often blur the line between jokes and serious topics in general
doesnt excuse it, dont joke about these things, it can affect people who have actual experience with it as well thats why we have #deleted-channel
We dont know at this time
what happened
rip
no joke this might be the worst lo mein i've ever had
He broke the ever evasive rule 7
Don’t think he should be perma banned but that’s not my choice to make. Just made a joke in poor taste
i swear to god the ice maker in the freezer scares the shit out of me every single time
i'm too scared
Pretend u didn’t see me
U managed to catch both of my bad hair days the time I’ve been here
Im the king of bad hair
So i cant judge anyone
i'm probably gonna end up laying down and zooming on my phone for a lot of classes
at the very least it will be hard to resist
Sorry abt the drug talk!!
BAD *sprays u*
umm thats so mean maybe she just wants a rub and a snug
Or the beast wants to claw you. Take no chances. 🧠
Cats don’t claw unless the human gives bad vibes
Sorry guys
Yea^ I don't like what u said🤨
Just bad vibes neel
Bad vibes is one of those phrases that somebody makes up when they walk into a haunted house. The cat has detected the bad juju.
I wasn’t simping for her (my friend not the cat)
Let’s hope you weren’t simping for the cat. That would be some seriously bad vibes.
I hate that story
Looks like something I shouldn’t search
like just a bad person
Didn't he die lmao
This hair shit is a bust
Don’t recommend it
I cut it to half it’s length before I came here
if i looked good bald i would never have hair
The hell is just getting it to look the way i want
Optimistic mate, some people dont got that choice
*sad genetic noises*
Rip
My parents won’t let me leave the house to get food while they’re not home
To do drugs or hook up with someone
My parents know that there’s 0 risk with me because I’m such a nerd. 😄
I don’t see the point of trying to build trust when they will never trust me
My parents trust me but they shouldn’t
> My parents know that there’s 0 risk with me because I’m such a nerd. 😄
@joyousmischief  I’m the same way except they still don’t trust me
Not too far from home
If they wanna beat my ass they’ll drive 2 hours to do it
They would lose it if u went cross country
Out of the country fuck it
My parents aren’t tooooo helicopter compared to others
But they’re still protective
They’re not strict in other areas though
I was looking up study abroad options and saw it
no study abroad going on this year im sure
Next yr tho
i really want to go to like utokyo or snu
Well for uchi they’re still doing it
US is study abroad for me
Never study abroad in america
where do u wanna study abroad? paris? tokyo? london?
"cleveland 😌"
My mum works in humam trafficing, and no one wants to go here
Trying to get ppl to come to cleveland is a pain
Cuz no one wants to be here
U just end up here
Only thing leaving Cleveland is the industry
and if nyu wasn't in nyc it would have like none of the same draw
I’ll stay if I get the job I want
I don’t need the degree just connections
Hate heat
We’re all stuck here  aren’t we
I don’t want my snow
Oh that too
And will last a long time
Urest of the civil kind dont stop
illinois on the whole sucks dog dick
Went to our “capital” of Springfield
Nothing there
Except some racists
chicago gets boring
and i don't have w problem with boring anyway, better than frightening
Omg Chicago isn’t frightening 😱
have u been to the hot dog place where they insult u
Which hot dog place
Yea Cleveland seems so spread out in a weird way
Cultural parks sounds cool but it doesn’t seem like much
That’s any city isn’t it?
Cleveland is particularly bad with it
But if you just drive down Cedar you won't find anything of interest
Atleast Cleveland isn’t Detroit
ppl love to shit on detroit but they've never even been there lmao
Will not start long winded rant but will fight u if u dare try to talk abt Chicago crime stats without addressing the systemic issues that cause it
It’s good shit
Chicago has the bean and that's al they need
i lived there for a few years in middle school and there's sooo much to it that just boiling it down to the pictures of slums you see online and nothing else is um
Don’t say shit if uve never been 😘
Downtown sucks but the suburbs are quite nice places
I feel like that statement is applicable to most cities
Oh we aren’t talking about houses?
Can’t find housing in any city without horrid prices
Fax tho
But realistically it’s so hard
Does gentrification exist in Cleveland or is the city so bad that rich people dont even bother
And I don’t like suburbs enough to go there for a house
I just want an apartment with a nice view without worrying about weird neighbors
Areas get better; areas get worse. It’s what happens when you have changing conditions in a city and country.
Idk I rarely have used my backyard in the 18 years I’ve been here
A backyard is just the tiny part of American Dream that is left me
Well, you’re a student in college. You still have a long time to improve.
Oh no what I want
The nuclear family stuff is the thing that stuck
Rip ppl immigrating in 2020
Government isn’t making it much better tho
Isn’t this the east side
I can get just about anywhere in Chicago back home on feeling
Never thought I’d miss it so
But these curves in Cleveland just aren’t it
Why am I getting emails for med school?
They think u be tho
Probably because I speed ran those cpr certificates
Equivlent to canadian's sorry
or whatever you want really
It means what it needs to mean
I just say it when I accidentally bump someone or open a door right as someone else was gonna
Oop is internet speak
Well not internet speak but that’s another subject
I’m not sure what that means as a reaction to a shitty pun, though. 🙂
Like “ope that’s pretty bad”
Oh, I got the medical school one too. That’s bizarre.
Oh no they’re recruiting
Trying to steal other majors
Yeah, that seems most likely.
I will cause a 400% mortality rate
I cant medical
ALL the washers r taken🤡
Oh fr

I’m guarding it as in watching tv on my laptop and not moving
I told my parents not to come unless they have my laptop
Omg 4 mins left!! If u want to stay in clown gang u will guard it

Yea I'm prolly not gonna do Sunday's either but I need to today
2 mins
Rip, light sleeper?
Missed the whole party yesterday
Thinkbox so far tho
The only viruses people get at a gaming party is when they make some poor downloading decisions.
I need to upgrade my storage
I have like 6gb left
I don’t kno which spec talks abt storage space
Its a laptop
Since its a base 16 system i have 1/2 of urs and 1/4 of rons

Quick maths
On a 2nd thought you doing my laundry since iknclown gang leader
Um u can't even get in gurl🤡

Oh
We need the prof to sponsor us
They don’t wanna become a sick bay
but idk if case cares abt us and our families
But the school only cares about liability with law suites.
because they dont want ppl who have symptoms traveling and infecting other ppl
If there’s an outbreak we shelter in place for 2 weeks then retest
Idk
Sorry

Their housemates aren't of the same mindset

That’s how North Korea does it. And they still report 0 cases. 😆
But lemme find it
so i guess someone got move into quarnatine
I just realized why my allergies haven't been bad during the day and only at night: I've been wearing a mask whenever outside and the only time I'm indoors long enough w/o a mask is when I'm going to bed
2 hours to go
Damn that’s early
@2waynice is that you on math 122
or fail together
Math126😥
@Deleted User fuck u smart bitch
*awkward moment when case didnt pay for the education/business zoom pack, and is limitied by how many people can join zoom*
Trying to make a mad dash to the library to get Ethernet wire
smh ron, you could've kept mine for a little longer
Oh my
i really need to stop leaving the house
I realize that if I miss the first couple of minutes of class it’s fine
our calc teacher said he recommends we go to class
Oh lmaooo

My psychology and sages all still 3 times
@chandachan 502 Bad Gateway
Math126 is a 🤡
502 bad gateway
oh crap
holy shit i really hurt my ankle lmao
I don't know if gmail allows files over a certain limit of MBs
this teacher seems kind of
i am trying to switch to a in-person after sept 1st
someone just coughed on my zoom call 😬
but the prof isnt here yet lol
yea i hate it
my brain hates it with a fury
If someone else is typing then it can be annoying
Satisfying if they have a very high WPM tho
Doesn't sound like **click** **clack**
If it aint a cherry blue equivalent miss me with that
i like the sound of blues every once in a while but man are they annoying to constantly hear through other peoples mics
I hate blues and jazz, totally agree aidan
What's even the point without the clicky
RIP
Although I did spend a little too much to round out my Chroma peripherals last semester
I dunno if they're still doing it because of corona but there's a place on campus where you can rent out a VIVE I believe
Worst case the virtual worlds lab has a couple set up regularly
i wanna try even tho im not epic gamer
I bought an Oculus rift full room setup for $300 last year
It aint THAT expensive to get in to
All deliveries end up at wade anyways
However the address in MyHousing is specific to my dorm:
1615 Mistletoe Dr #411 Cleveland, OH 44106-3966
I'm about to knock on your door
Pawned my rift off on a buddy at OSU so we can play VRChat and shit
sorry for iterating this for the nth time
Also one final question, does wade commons store your packages longer than the amazon locker (3 days) because I only get discharged from the hotel on Sep. 1st
OSU! is hard as fuck
Beat saber tho
OH CRAP YOU SAID TOSU
still need to try osu
But I am a lowly mouse user and can't come close to the wacom players
I've been trying to beat this one for months
I have never touched a ranked/competitive mode in any video game
i mean my math class as legit just talking about men and sheep
even if u get up there its hard to maintain
ranked is just sweaty people trying far to hard. If you are a slave to the meta then you arent enjoying the game
nahh the strat is to use the dumbest shit in ranked
I started making my own beat map last week but haven't finished it yet https://photos.app.goo.gl/JM5SGmV465E2NKdk7
its just so much work
gaming really do be physical
just dont get vr dont sweat and stonks
just dont get vr
cuz we aint rich
even tho i want vr i doubt ill actually use it enough to be worth it
its like even tho im dead set on getting the ps5 will i only play like 2 games
I still got the PS2:)
That's why you buy a cheap headset you can resell if you don't like it
I ended up buying my index because I've almost put 100 hours in to Beat Saber alone
If I get to 100 hours in VRChat I'm going to buy body trackers
damn
pls dont call cops
Nah bro VRChat is sick
alcohol is shit
i dont like the taste
rip ron
I suppose. There's plenty of drinks I hate but there's a few that are p tasty
I can't really get too down with the sake taste for instance
Just don't end up like some of my friends freshman year who had to spend a night at UH because they slapped the bag a bit too hard
stomach pump go brrrr
its easy to get ur stomach pumped here
Still spendy tho
Some rooms are defs uncomfortable tho with people like petting eachother or something
and far far far away from them
anyone else not able to log onto sis?
i havent tried logging in today
so idk
Paid some of my tuition earlier today
well anyone in math 223?
ham and tomato n shit
it keeps getting better
idk how theyre doing that w covid
but i have a class there
ugh i have to go to riteaid
i forgot to unpack my hairbrush 😔
Omg

ur in the residence arent u
i hate how that's how it's spelled
oh no
I dont have corona
Missed the hec by like 1 minute can I get an F
I can’t believe they have a whole website up and running but no map??
Nope
There’s employees?? Inside but no way to get in
This is reminded me that I haven’t written anything of substance in like 9 months
My handwriting is shit
yesss the urchins will have to stay inside
what the hell has happened to me
Spelling has gone to 💩 too
i never lost it
cuz i never had it
2 seconds after class is over i'm laying in bed
remote is secretly the shit
remote classes suck tho
also it's hard to pay attention to all-online
My psychology class was not bad
or left
Guys even though I’m upset that I’m not on campus at least I got a pair of socks from cwru
Wasn’t as memorable as the mad dash I made for the Ethernet cable before that class
left is the cafe right is cafeteria
did they close it
rip
Too scared to make eye contact with an employee inside
i didnt think they closed until like 4
Please don’t encourage bad behavior :banhammer:
**don't** shatter the glass
Cafe closed
Nothing there
rip
damn
i dunno
I don’t even know if it’s going at all
college be zoom
My navigator hasn’t even given me a sages class
And he hasn’t answered my email
-mc oh it doesn't work
i still haven't taken my second one yet
What am I even supposed to do
mostly because NA and SO were basically gone by the time I was able to register
it's a fuckup from when SAGES were introduced, because normally you're supposed to be done by the end of Sophomore year
but the first year they did it, apparently a lot of upperclassmen saw the classes and wanted to take them, and because they get priority on registration
thats a rip
*technically* you're supposed to still have it done by the end of Sophomore year
but realistically, most likely the end of Junior year
this zoom stuff do be ruining the college feel
it feels just like my highschool on lockdown
oh noice
mfw my Qchem lab protocols are 14 pages long ;-; how am I supposed to finish in just 3 hours
lots of work already
not rlly feeling my entrepreneurial finance class
it's like 100% application and like no study of financial markets, how start-ups work from an analytical standpoint, etc
I have yet to meet 2 professors but all of mine this year so far have been really awesome
tf is wrong w u
Didn’t know it had a cult following
i would be dead if there were almonds
Don’t talk about uncultured
Plus I don’t like guac. There I said it
bruh actually tho
At first I thought he was drawing girls. But it turned out to be sheeps
raunak, i didnt know u were welsh
I don’t see the connection
Still not understand
sadly yes 😔
not their fault case cheaped out and didnt buy the education plan
“In addition, some students and their parents have indicated the food provided is insufficient to meet their caloric needs.” Oof, that is a bad look.
So I resorted to lying and telling the front desk that the food delivery forgot me so could they give me another package
At this point I’m wondering what the school hasn’t botched.
nothing
watch them charge u tho
I don’t think you can order room service Bc hotels want to limit contact w ppl and the rooms.
im sure room service would just leave the food outside of your room
shit
Joke
Head
> :dogegun:
@2waynice oh god oh fuck
starting from like week 2
I think they might suspect me tho
But I rlly rlly want more
I'm on the 7th and it's so boring
Everyday is boring tbh
All I did was have a friend who was leaving drop off his extra fruit before he left
I didn’t even have any notebooks with me or anything
You need me to drop off anything?
Like, left her room?
Not go outside though
I feel like an absolute clown
Zach I know you are mad at me sorry I will jot leave my room again
Death
I'm not mad at you, you didn't leave the hotel, and you only had contact with somebody else in complete quarantine
I will not leave the hotel room until my discharge date
The brain does not want to shut down tonight
Once I miss that 😐
oooo rip
I’ve had baby shark going in my head the entire time my eyes were closed
That’s almost certain death
My stomach would cri
Man I feel you the anxiety does kick in hard
get some air, its a pro strat
I'm a textbook bc I barely open up
in the most boring font
Ugh if its gonna rain that means its going to be super humid too
rainy too so can't have the fan goin
ugh
I have yet to see it rain in Cleveland
yeah but then I have to close my window and my room hits 200 degrees
I love the cold
damn right it does
I have a lab in 12 hours that is 30 something steps long and I have yet to start writing my protocol
you ain't wrong
Damn college students dont sleep
Unfortunately so
I forgot beers law
Isn't that absorption
I haven't had to use brain in like
cold > warm
half a year
don't die
I took a summer class to try to mitigate quarantine brain and yet today felt
i hate the cold
I despise the cold
If you read this and you are still up then you need to go to sleep
But seriously what are you guys doing so late
Studying for a quiz Zach is an ra on call I think
Oh
I’m  already in Clown gang 🤡
Oh
I have a lab class in like 19 minutes
wish me luck
I’m so lost in chem
Strosacker is pretty hard to miss
Still takes a bit walking though, it's decently far
we dont needa pay right
How to get to little Italy without walking
Big sad
This is so sad

Shit there is a hurricane bound to strike texas soon
whenever they have to be over dumb old stupid texas

Howdy plz confirm that there’s no way to get into little Italy without walking
I'm glad I moved out though but I'm worried about my family :/

Oh
Does anyone know how jazz auditions work?
I mean I’m trying to do jazz 2
So it probably won’t be quite as bad as 1
> After extensive discussion and review, we have adopted an approach that recognizes the extraordinary efforts of our faculty in adapting courses for remote instruction this fall—as well as remote students’ inability to access services that require physical access to Northeast Ohio.
> 
> First, the university will charge all students the same tuition, regardless of location. Our faculty have prepared for remote and/or blended instruction throughout the summer, with many participating in a six-week program designed to help them learn and apply strategies for more effective and engaging class sessions throughout the semester. In addition, the faculty’s spring experiences teaching via Zoom provided invaluable lessons for this semester.

Smh my head
baked chips are like the worst though
still unhealthy and they taste bad
my stomach in a bad way
I refuse to eat anything that isn’t deep fried in bacon grease.
worse
Olive oil tho
Wtf 65% less fat
I want 65% more fat
It looks like somebody already bagged your target.
baked lays is the best potato chip on the market
disagree? fuck you
holy shit I disagree
aidan ur missing it
really
The snacc ppl have left
I’m Irish, so any variation of a potato is already perfection.
> The snacc ppl have left
If their group died off, would it be fratricide?
Optimistic I'm honestly just disappointed in your poor palate
i'm sorry i have a really uhh,, sensitive tongue, and it's easily offended by shitty snack foods doused in canola oil and refined salts
i'm so sorry
don't eat flamin hot cheetos unless you don't care about yourself and your value
get longer biatch
The inches I lost horizontally should transfer vertically
Human biology is stupid
how do you lose inches horizontally
do u want to be wider
I just lost weight and inches randomly
have your leg bones broken and gradually moved apart over a period of several months so you can grow 3/4ths of an inch
If I can’t handle spice I’d b a disgrace to my family
people actually get upset stomachs and diarrhea from hot food? i literally never have
Zhanda baby stomach
zhanda baby stomach
ok but u just said u cant eat takis without indigestion. like
I didn’t bring 2 family bags of takis with me for show
my friend pepper sprayed me in the mouth by accident years ago nothing can hurt me anymore
Bc then I feel less bad when I eat 10
hot foods = speed up metabolism = eat as much as you want
But that won’t stop me
My metabolism be slow af
Rip
my pharm professor wont. stop. talking
I forgot classes still exist today

i had a recorded lecture from my pharm lady i have that class on monday mornings
rip
i also don't have any classes on thursday and have 6 hours on wednesday
i fucked my schedule really bad

rip
A majority of my classes are spaced out enough that I don’t feel bad
At least not yet
cause im waking up naturally at like 8:30 anyways
But it’s usually 9 so rip anatomy
mine doesn't which is actually so fucking annoying
i wish i could go to sleep at 3 and wake up at noon
Can’t fix ur sleep schedule if it’s already fixed
i feel like i should be writing a paper
Don’t
cuz the profs suc at canvas
I mean I have no other real work to do
I’ve given up on bio114 already
dont u got a 9pm meeting for that?
These last 30 words to hit the minimum count is killing me
why the hell wouldnt they
When there’s a new cycle of news stories abt ppl getting hospitalized from hot chip
we have to write a report on silent spring for this class and i've already read and annotated it :naenae:
couldnt be me
Nah idk where to find it
I rlly want it
They said it would be in our common rooms or smth I don’t remember
No u don’t have to read it
ic, and we dont have to pay for it
But if I don’t get the book I will b 😡
after monching on rons takis the other day i realized how much i've been lacking in the takis department

Rip
Omg

if they dont want any more, give it to me
ron, have u tried the jolly scholar, u get 5 swipes there a week and its p good
*yet*
I see the line for den and Denny’s isn’t even that good
I just ate leftovers today
Well they do gpa, but can’t reveal the secret recipe like that
so they leave is vaguish
All I know is that I can’t get lower than a 73 or a fail the nursing thing
if a doesn't mean 4.0 then that's just dumb
ok apparently A = 4.0 B = 3.0 etc.
nope
i mean yeah they do but apparently this school doesnt
Go hard or perish
u either study ur entire time and get a 4.0
Can’t stop me now
but you dont seem to be having a good time?
But the bops don’t stop
Which is big sad
Wjay class
we need a zhanda to english translator
Optimistic needs to learn context smh

its not too bad
The BIOL214 class has more than 300 people in it. Praise Jeezus! Only took them a day.

rip bio kids
Apparently some dumbass went into the gym while being symptomatic
and testing anyone that was inside]
my window is open and i dont hear much
Gotta love the exposed nose
I think it stopped
the exposed nose is like underwear but the dick is out while the balls are cover
does nothing
LMAO rip
ron has lost all the marbles
rip ron
I take my mask off if I’m walking outside alone
I don't take my mask off unless i'm in my dorm, brushing my teeth, showering, or eating/drinking
cuz gymbros are probs contagious
I did my workout in bed so I could sleep yesterday
Honestly walking around campus is work on its own
but ron, u gotta go out if u want foods
I have the campus map as a permanent tab on my phone
No I don’t
Haven’t even tapped into the ramen selection yet
anyone else oddly tired, i havent done any hw, just ready to nap
Forgot how exhausting school is
Like I’m tired but I’m almost 100% sure that if I were to actually go to bed rn I wouldn’t sleep for at least another 4 hours
fair
school just cause the heady hurty at all hours
Plus by being on a college campus u never rlly escape jt
I didn’t have a choice in this either
oh damn they have a full on screen going on over there
I need to shiy
Shit
just shit your pants
oh no
It’s sorta near the end where they’re infiltrating the ship
oh dang, then they've been on that for awhile
fair, it do be c r o n c h y
this is why we can't have nice things
you can do it all there (assuming the printers are working, which they usually aren't)
Optimistic left the server 😢 😢 😢
Did CaseWireless just die?
But how can u resign when u didn't even have the position🤔
I hope utech sends out an email or something about the WiFi issue so teachers won’t b upset
Case WiFi is trash it goes down all the time - pro tip use the Ethernet port in your room. And if it’s broken put in a maintenance request and they’ll fix it... eventually....
I put too many minutes
I can only zoom on my phone until I get my new laptop 😭
Can’t Ethernet it
I have no clue I haven’t done laundry yet lol
do we submit a matinence request form for ethernet if it didn’t work the first time?
i forgot to pack one
i gave mine to chris if u want to see
fair
hey y’all just gonna say please don’t post the book drive link in your zoom calls. we don’t want that getting taken down
Do you have to go inside thwing to get into the jolly scholar?
someone did it earlier today
Someone just straight up put the pdf of the psych textbook in the zoom chat on Monday and it’s like dude be more careful
Now it can’t be accessed anymore lol
smh my head
imagine being able to get a pdf of a textbook 😔
and thats on professors telling us we need the newest edition or else </3
its right inside, go through the doors and gonna be on ur left
and the 7th doesnt have a pdf version
In the drive there’s only the 2nd
Speaking of which luckily I downloaded it before it got taken down who can I tell to put it in the drive
I think you can upload it urself
Aw man it’s perfect weather
it be raining
would be better if it was snowing tho
i just went into the pych folder
i think u should beable to upload it
No there’s no upload files option for me
rip
“You don’t have permission to edit PSCL 101”
Well I tried I’m getting food
I don’t think I’ll have many books on there since nursing :Angryhaha: so I’m not gna
I am certain that most if not all the textbooks on the drive are a hand click away on libgen
For rta all I need to do is show the sticker right?
They never even check ed for me lmfao
Anyone know what we need for the PHYS 122 lab?
you need the iolab thing
and the list dr driscoll gave us of random crap
Do you know what random crap we need just for today?
Omg when I didn’t see anything
The random crap was like a laser pointer, toilet paper roll, styrofoam plate, 1 wood nail
Do you think we need it all today?
lab wont be a real lab till after class drop deadline
i dont actully watch physics
I’m not as smart as you so I need to pay attention
I need to take notes or imma do bad in physics lmao
Also cuz you spotted me yesterday mag
idk why its not disabled
we just played tik tac toe last year on our professor's screen when he got too boring to watch
for those of you taking Bader's class rn for 214, he got pissed after a couple games
Our bio class goes NUTS with annotating the screen
Why hasn’t he disabled it for everyone?
I remember in a class when a bunch of people ignored the TA saying pencils down and the prof took 10% off everyone's test
oh to be a screaming child in a playground
At least he's not maliciously bad
oh no he is
i still ended up doing fine in his class last semester, but the guy went out of his way to screw with the class
Let me put it like this:

Chem
-Class gets a higher average on a test
-Drew Meyers tells the class that he likes that we worked harder to understand the content for the test.
-Test stays the around the same difficulty and is very willing to answer emails/questions

Bio
-Class gets higher than a C average on a test
-Bader tells the class that there is no way we got it legitimately and that it is very "interesting"
-Makes 50%+ of questions on the next test have nothing to do with what he went over in class nor ever mentioned-->average goes down to high D/low C-->Stops answering emails
Teachers who brag about not giving out many As/Bs are the worst
you think bader is just a nice boring old white man
but hes really a mean boring old white man
hes the worst bio professor lol
which chem class?
they're still doing convocation?
its boring
Pull up to my in person math clas tmrw
convocation is supposed to be optional
hell, my sages professor just said "screw it. if you don't wanna go, there's no value in going"
hell, I didn't even go last year
Im dead
sadly not
I didn’t.
Rip, it be lost to void
I was jokin about making stupid people fight in gladiator arenas
someone was just typing fart
some were serious about politics and voting
Yeah, and people got mad that you weren’t involved enough in politics. XD
Glad i skipped that zoom, shame i missed thw chat
I didn't even know there was one
lmao, it was me, I wasnt really serioud
ONG, if I get the chance to leave this planet and go to mars
Just no one wants to put the money in
but converting NFL arenas to gladitorial pits seems cooler
fight to the death
im pretty sure both will either get it right or get it wrong lol
ngl, kinda mad, I want that chat back
as in both will get it right or both will get it wrong
Yeah, I left the stream after the chat died. XD
Idk how they expect me to know about this stuff
only reason i know is cause our java teacher said we could skip the recitation for it
Doesn't sound like I missed anything
You really didn’t.
Besides funky chat apparently
I can’t wait to bullshit in my Sages class, because I didn’t pay attention to any of that.
I mean that's generally all they are aren't they
I presume for the den you're supposed to do "meal plan combos"
my teacher barely cared about it last year
Oops I forgot abt convocation
convocation is that one big event on campus that no one ever gives a shit about
That’s any event that doesn’t come with food
I didn't even know it existed
I just want the freakin book
But idk where to get it
Oh lit
although it wasn't held last year
Rip
Fingers crossed for next semester. Is it just me or does CaseCon sound like a rip off loot box site?
i'm still a sophomore, so I've never been to one personally, but I was one of executives of the clubs that normally run it
i'm not on exec there anymore
meetings took forever
and I had other things I want to do with my time
Fair
I’m worried I joined too many clubs
But that won’t rlly matter until things go back in person
> I’m worried I joined too many clubs
can always leave yeah
oh there's a groupme?
I feel like I'm on stackoverflow
Oh if anyone sees this and is in section 116 it meets on even weeks apparently
I don’t take offense to that
Didn’t you post some google form about betting when we’d get sent home
Oh yeah sorry
You wish
cases are a bit of a lagging statistic though
There was some frats trying to recruit ppl the other day
he do be slammin his head
Cops really do be goimg brrrrrrrrr tonite
don't
oh no
i feel like my only purpose in life is simping
And then blamed me for making him look stupid when he could have done it over dms
I feel like I slept -2 hours but I checked and I slept 8
I need to do my laundry this weekend
so i had an 8am class and now i have nothing till 1... so i guess i'll die
I finished all my hw and studying yesterday
My next class is at 9:00 PM so I'm just going to grind other work and go to the Finding your Narrative thing for premeds and the AMSA informational meeting
its a big rip for ur evening tho
but i guess it would otherwise be spent doing hw
> My next class is at 9:00 PM so I'm just going to grind other work and go to the Finding your Narrative thing for premeds and the AMSA informational meeting
@syberkonda where can I find information about this? I’m pretty interested in attending
rip
damn
oh initials of the author
monday and friday are 1 class days for me
Rip
oh
Damn rip anyone taking 5 classes
5 or more kinda hurts
this is how I feel like case feels about us
I'm taking 5 but one of them is pass/fail so It doesn't really count
oh no
Didn't realize y'all were talking same day
Isnt 5 total what’s recommended
I was gonna take 6 but it said I had to talk to a navigator if I wanted to do that and I didn't want to bother
Or maybe I just recorded it in my calendar wrong
In one day? Dunno
all my classes happened to be on m/w/f
and I kinda want to have a somewhat easier senior year
I ain't trying to grind during remote education
as remote education ain't that good
When u don’t have to run between classes
and a minor in something i currently haven't decided yet, although i definitely want one and that's why I've done a few extra courses that aren't in major reqs
like my comics class last semester. that was a REALLY run class
Comic class?
hell, professor Ricca flat out cancelled a paper when we were sent home
and for 3 months, we had no assignments
until the very last week where we had to make a powerpoint and a paper that was graded on completion, not quality
there were only 3 assignments last semester if I recall
one due like week 2 that was sort of an intro
a paper on Action Comics Number 1 and technique due in february
and then the final project due in may
couldnt be me
The professor has a super wack canvas setup and I can’t find his zoom link no where, someone help me out
Cut it out
Omg
Imma throw some Shit oit the window at tou

Nah 111 was a lecture based class and not a pogel
Anyone know if his cause of death was COVID-19? https://thedaily.case.edu/master-of-science-in-anesthesia-student-christopher-lysyj-passes-away/
Damn this group is gonna be ded soon
I don't think so
yeah I found what he died from
It's probably because most people are in class atm people finna go stupid crazy on the weekends on this server
Oh damn
Times might be hard but we will get through at the end that's on everything
certainly explains why the school didn't say anything about the cause
I dont think the school would disclose the cause of death even if it weren't suicide
He ain’t wrong tho
looks like another bout of rain
Hopefully it never stops raining
But first it has to start raining
not very hard
Bruh now I'm stuck here

Ah shit
honestly idk what they thought was gonna happen
you put a bunch of people who have been deprived of human contact for like 6 months in close proximity without any authority to prevent them from being in groups, and then they group up
Wrong aidan
that's the thing it doesn't matter
you're gonna get enough people with it to give it to people who aren't doing anything wrong

It be boring asf an confusing bc I have no knowledge about classical music or composition or wtv and the readings are super long as well as the writing

The random red doesn’t help. It keeps pulling your attention away and makes the sea of black text even duller by comparison.

I feel like it also means the teacher prob just reads straight from the slides
She didn't specify
All I need to buy is some more snacks
Oh tru

i dunno what that means, bad for ur tummy?
no, its college food
it doesn't taste that bad
the food aint going to kill you
Just don't get the unhealthy stuff
I don't eat them because Im allergic
apple pie tho
I only realized I was allergic fairly recently so I dunno about the qualifiers
rip, how did you realize?
When I ate apples I could tell, like it made me feel kinda nauseous and gave me like the runs
I just never linked the two
I thought being able to tell you had eaten an apple was just a fact of apples
Like someone I know who's allergic to pineapple who thought it was supposed to numb the mouth
Not since
7 strings be sacrilegious tho 😠
Cuz that's when I wake up

one of my stage pianos evaporated 6 months of my wages as a cashier
arent pianos pretty bulky
let alone "one of"
yeah mine is super light even though it has 88 keys
comparing these two is like comparing a sports car to a pickup truck
so it's kind of slow and really hard to use, but more powerful than most DAWs
We should use that on peolpe who don't wear masks

so I couldn't take it
due to bulk ordering
I ain't no drawing tablet expert
do you have a laptop, or just plan on writing on paper during inperson classes?

this is more for work submission that I'm talking about
🤡don't
since it needs to be digital
and I don't want to print it out
as the printers are constantly broken and bleed through real bad
ugh I have to install office
you could get libre if we dont get 365 through case
intresting, they arent using onthehub
why does it work on internet

Some of these freshmen be so damn disrespectful
Has anyone already done the work of seeing how loud you can be without alerting neighbors
ron u dont got neighborstho :thonk:
Well bc my room is in a semi high traffic area
Nah I’m just using my phone
Also, I’m not trying to get in trouble for saying my bad words
zhanda, you cant do it everytime
Smh if only ppl stopped doing laundry
They deserve it for bad cybersecurity practices
Gosh I guess I’ll do all the work myself and figure it out
I blast bowling for soup all the time, my neighbors can't hear it
or crying
ron, just do this
YO, what u want
Sometimes I feel like peeking when they’re super loud
tried and tested theory
But then i don’t wanna leave
Never even thought of using that lol
i dont believe either of those things
Fair
are we alone in the universe
science still cant answer
i dont
I’m still trying to figure out how to get into horny jail
You guys are a real sad bunch huh
if you dont want to take the ez route
you have the hard route
I couldn’t possibly take that spot from Simpo
The car?
you need one to be supremo simpo
Now just the car
fair
storm, as in xmen storm, she was married to panther last i thought
cuz you cant have interriacial couples smh
Honestly can’t see ororo with anyone
Hence why the whole set up was worse outside of the obvious
Gods don’t need sex
but people in horny jail need to write their fanfic
so back to comics, near all couples in comics are fanservice
~~never read one~~
But that won’t stop me and a ton of others from buying and reading them
i will say the original death of superman
but death, couples, marry
all a bunch of stuff u kno wont stick
I haven’t been in comics for long enough esp not in the fandom of it to kno what was huge lol
Why I wasn’t upset when they explained miles joining 616 lol
but have u read the killing joke?
yea, thats batman's "death of superman"
I tend to get more into individual heroes more than storylines so until I see a hero that catches my eye rip dc money
Wasn’t killing joke used for one of those movies
the killing joke had an animated movie about it
Oh yeye
i watched a bit of avengers assemble sat mornings, but never like deticated myself to watch it entirely
I heard X-men is good but I can’t get past the old school animation
and tell me you dont get any hype from that theme
fucking king
omg
omg
im dead
hi dead i'm dad
Once I started reading event comics I learned that world building and universes are a pain
Oh I get it
I was looking thru my bookcase before I left and found some manga for some things I definitely no longer read
i don't think u can find comics in my home country
:critty: 
mmm, yeah
i don't think so
Like I want to spray them with Clorox
And i was likesmh my head
Its still a rona risk
We need to bonk them
But it was still awkward af
Fair
But it’s sad bc they didn’t have the flavor I wanted
they ran out of a flavor?
Idk
Maybe I can’t read I couldn’t find peach flavor
what flavor did u want
I thought it wasn’t
i havent been to mitchells in forever
i cant remeber off the top of my head
But it doesn’t say when it’s in season 😭
Omg almost all the other flavors I wanted to try are seasonal lol
omg i miss it.
Nah if I have too much I won’t eat it
I’ll budge on everything except cheese
Idk maybe I got like the top of the tub but there was almost none
really, you didnt get much marshmellow?
Yea that’s what I wanted but it was all blue all the way down
Still good tho
i left the bowl i stole from leutner in the taft sink when i moved out

But I don’t wanna waste mi money
wireless is gonna hurt your wallet
Oh they're cheaper now
Especially since the band is metal so they don't break
yeah don't get cheaply built ones
Yea I just want semi decent sound
They really crank the bass on a lot of popular headphones though
But obv now I can’t go out and try things
Which are terrible
I meant the soundscape isn't even
Hate high pitched sounds
I was able to repair it though
Oh I don't get that
Bad idea
Omg rlly
Just need to figure out which one
I don't use it
You don't need to install it either
i tried fillng it in today but like
it just didn't look like me
also my parents are gonna kill me if they ever see it which is why i'll need to fill it in
Fair I just opened it up on my phone and idc enough to download a separate app for YouTube

Smh if they wanted to steal my money they should’ve done something fun like scamming

Tuition isn’t scamming
Oh engineering
no body knows this school outside of ohio
Not in my profession rip
Nursing school barely matters
I didn't even know about the nursing school
oh
I have infinite work and no work at the same time
Infinite work when I remember it, no work when I pretend I do not see it
I was holding off this nursing basic math test thinking it was a big deal
But it’s just 10 questions of actual basic math lol
well nurses dont rlly need yo know like complicated math
Quick maths
quick maths
So now that I’ve done the basic math for 2 minutes
I will now pretend I don’t have other work
They said that test should’ve taken 36 minutes
I mean they obviously didn’t tailor testing times
Bc all of the tests are 36 minutes long
theres got to be some reason for it
but i dont know it
that shit not ideal
it smells real bad tho
I think that would kill people
death by smell
rip
my stupid mouse keeps falling off the stupid desk
A very scary thought
someone in this dorm is smoking abundant amounts of pot
smells like shit
Rip

ok someone smokin again
next fall does seem most likely
classes probably won't normalize but I think it'll be better
The physics lecture isn't uploaded yet unfortunately so I can't show you the video
But what happened is he asked the class if they had any questions and one guy unmuted his mic and the loudest static I've ever heard played for a solid five seconds
hopefully they don't edit it out
I'm bored and sleeping is for nerds
been a while tho
someone knocked on my door sorry
It automatically started yesterday and it’s really annoying
I also hate it
isn't the app just for availability?
I mean I don't really know

Nothing is appearing on honey :/

That sucks
So it’s just math
Time isn’t real
But I finally got my laptop yesterday
I feel for you
ye, in comparison the laptop should be like lightning
Nah, there was a Case barstool last year that had a decent amount of stuff
It was just taken down at some point within the last couple months
Love that my phone says 40% chance of rain
> Love that my phone says 40% chance of rain
@mootdoot  :This:
I don't wanna know what 100 percent looks like
better rain then no rain
Couldn’t be me
Do you though👀
Now look what you’ve done Clifford is crying

You don't say
I guess we gotta become fish
it wasn't raining as hard then too
and it cant get u wet without ur consent
didn't mr professor tell us to email someone if we didn't wanna use attendance ticket
*I now want to go outside*
Everyone in psychology is talking about a quiz I definitely haven’t heard about or taken yet oops
Stonks don't give me free money
Its actually not that bad huh
Bad vibes rn
Should’ve stolen one from my family’s place rip
But I must get thru the rain first to get it
Which defeats the purpose bc I’m trying to get back to my dorm
Rip
They closed down mlk
Man if my laptop gets a single raindrop on it as a dash back to my dorm
Will cry
Close it b4 u leave
So, mlk river hasnt flooded yet
Yet
Till it goes over
But too late 4 that
if there wasnt lightning i'd totally stay out there
rain is great
that means whoever is the loser gets nothing
Isn't this like
The 4th time this has happened
smh my head
i was outside
i haven't seen any of this stuff that u saw, howdy-
am i too short?
i went down to mlk
I lost my charger 🥴
Cuz u need that charger
Smh and ofc I need my laptop for tomorrow’s lab
If I didn’t need it I would’ve entertained myself till it died then Amazon a new one

what laptop is it
Never hated myself more than when I went to get water and saw it. Right There.
you put your laptop charger
Brain has never been bigger
Don’t think I have enough tech stuff for that
cuz you always need a cable or two from time to time
Why Ethernet take so long, but can’t visit other sites
b/c the ethernet needs to be activated for it to work...?
But I can’t open up YouTube while it’s setting up
you're not supposed to be able to do so
you can't use a non-setup thing until it is setup
Rip
Time do be moving fast
oh it's just terrible product ideas I found
Hope I didn’t do anything wrong
its nothing big
It said firewall smh smh but my brain is still fried so I just hit continue
rip
Realized that this only had one USB port which is the biggest L I’ve ever taken
rip
i guess u need a usb hub then if you got lots of usb things u want to plug in at once
Once the internet kicks in 😔
so it aint quick
I’d feel bad if I quit and did it at night bc it’s already an hour into whatever its doing
its just wating for someone at u tech to press the ok button
My patience for phone calls is much longer than loading screens
damn, they leaving us on low priority
He said it doesn’t matter if it’s plugged in so
and tell it to allow u internet
nope
they are slow
Sounds scary
bout a year and a half ago
christ that feels like a long time ago
but i ate the big one
stop guys you're making me really hungry
seriously
I mean if it doesn't go through good
like doesn't that scratch your plate at all?
lol who gives a shit about the plates
doesn't scratch anyways
> lol who gives a shit about the plates
@koppiki parents
I guess
I also hate the noise it makes when it rubs against the plate
-cah end

I lost 5 percent on a lab cuz of this
I can’t heat up pizza on my hand 😔
I didn’t bring a knife large enough

Too late already eating
If I get poisoned then rip ig
if we dont hear back from ron in a day we assume ded
*tho warming up deep dish in a microwave, smh*
smh my head
That’s so much work
I haven’t checked
Would’ve eaten it cold if I didn’t have other things to heat up
Nerf or nothing
I’m willing to liberate 2 slices if anyone wants some
Howdy u want 2?
as much as i do, I cant take all ur pizza, i'll gladly snag 1 tho
how did it stay cold
You can take 2 slices tho bc I don’t think I can’t eat all 6 slices
i dont want to take stuff that ur parents got for ya
I’m still trying to watch my smokin hot bod
No they went out before they left
But didn’t bother asking if I wanted any smh
you just dont have that same quality/type round here
howwww does that happen
I’m still rationing my takis I didn’t get to go shopping
there really isnt that much to see
That if I had remembered them I would’ve sent my laptop there
i feel that it was brought up sometime ago
fair
Everyone was like “call if u need a ride somewhere” but the math of driving from Bedford to here to take me to a Walmart doesn’t rlly add up for me
I just need Walmart
And Costco but I need to get membership
Oh fr?
dunno
I didn't get any this year
I have abused good internet
To be fair tf2 is 25 gb and cs go is around that
since when is tf2 25 gigs
I don't think the number accurately reflects it
see I feel like that's more than 100 gigs already
I dunno if it does the math right
those things are fucking expensive
cuz I don't like the vive controllers
also valve has gone full send on vr
I'll lose a few games though which is unfortunate
It tricks your computer into thinking your headset is a rift
well it wasn't that big of a loss to begin with and now it's not a loss at all
regardless I don't make income
but I've put some money into the stock market so that might work out
although I don't really do much in terms of vidya piracy
damn, u ppl and ur fatt wallets
but it doesn't go on sale
my wallet ain't fat I just never buy anything
Here’s the song I’ve been trying to beat for months
not well though
people need to make the maps
I used to think about how bad piracy was. And to be fair even now I prefer to just buy a legit copy, even for retro stuff. I own an av famicom for example and can adapt NES games. At this point I can't be bothered since I've developed a hatred for certain... aspects of modern changes to copyright law.
Yeah most of the autogenerated ones are bad
rip
don't wanna make the maps
I want other people to do it for me
I also don't own the game
I mean death is fine but doesn't apply to corps
and every time ol mickey gets close to public domain it gets extended another 10 yearas
I meant from a creative works standpoint, so far as novels and shit goes
since it is to "promote progress"
who's worse: disney for opening, or people for going
equally bad?
-8ball is Disney worse than the people that went?
even communism is incentivized by money
I'd argue people that went are worse
I mean they're the ones who wanna go to disney in the end
if I sell people a swift kick in the nuts and someone gets their balls ruptured, wouldn't they be at fault
oh crap this person I help run a server for just pinged everyone
cuz that was asking for a world of hurt
oh noes
oh she runs it
I mean it used to be way, way worse
Wasn't ready
coudl never be ready
couldnt be me
I guess I still got the life insurance
i couldnt send rob to a bank
he'd be too scared
Oh shit
wtf
sorry ron for noise
because the wepa printers suck
How does one write on pdf on laptop
pdf suck
win10 version sucks
win10 version does suck
yeah it's removin the only reason to use office over docs
excel is pretty much the only reason to use office imo
win10 sucks in general
*we dont talk about those dark times*
windows 8 didn't happen
but I don't like how they're changing stuff
without running it with mmsys.cpl
rip
but it's not the main way anymore
rip
at least it's still there
like the new one sucks
my stuff is backed up but I don't see how that is relevant

Oh nooo

I missed the first meeting bc i got confused between PST and CST and EST
grace seems really good at like being an editor
like based off first impressions she seems very professional
Oh optimistic

LMAO megan wanted ur throne, King
um kind of shitty i'm not on campus now tho cuz i probably could have u know...*gone* to it, if there is going to be an audience
and idk if students would even be allowed
but the timing is pretty bad as far as publication goes bc paper goes to print like 3 days before the debate and by next week it would be old news
so i think she just wants me to interview administration *about* it happening there
like she said don't feel like you have to attend
She said to us at least that we shouldn't attend unless we want to see the ins and outs
I went to the initial interest meeting last week
Im not attending any of them tho
:thonk: i didn't see you at the interest meeting lol
unless there was another one
you mean initial like at the activities fair?
for ppl who missed the first one
Nope did u?

I joined archery and climbing as if anything was gna happen this year
well didnt archery say something about trying to do something
i'm also in mun and i'm *meant* to be in the student sustainability council but haven't heard a damn thing from any of the officers since the activity fair
always wanted to do it
Archery I think was trying to fill out the Covid sports forms
Last time I checked
I did archery at a summer camp I went to
I didn't know we had archery
never went
My mom wanted me to “bond with people like me”
> My mom wanted me to “bond with people like me”
@mootdoot crackheads?

I just want it to still be fun for me

Literally from 2 til now with only one break I’ve been taking notes
What, gonna cry?
Why not shit smh
How many images y'all got on your phone
I finished my ice cream today rip

Nope 1.4k
Yea bc I hate having useless things
phone?
Mine aren't of me

damn
Smh my head
And now if I lost it it’s gone rip
you cant lose any photos
I just save them from the internet
sometimes i'll just delete them all like when my phone is completely full and SHOCKINGLY i have not suffered any serious damage as a result of not having rando internet images
I feel that
It’s always a pain sorting thru my meme folder
Yeah Im not paying for spotify and shit
i dont listen to music and even i know having it on u is better than leaving it in hte cloud
every song i download to my phone is space that could be used for pictures of scottish folds
wtf u people dont listen to music on your phone....i would die without apple music
Nah finding all my music on YouTube is a pain
i dont use apple
216 hours
Spotify cost money and the bitrate is bad if you don't pay
Free version sucks
Ads and even if you crack it bitrate is bad
I still use it for weekly recommendation on browser
But that still suck
Idk what bitrate be
The point at which you don't really notice a difference is around 400 kbps
Idc computer things
People say they notice flac and shit but you need really good headphones
dont give me no flac
smh, computer person thing
I kno nothing of tech
On my phone
Spotify I still don't like
And with all my music downloaded I don’t think it’s ever mattered for me
rip
to be fair, anything above 75hz is kinda overkill for most things
Or maybe I never checked the settings
Face looks familiar
Dunno who tho
costco stopped stocking 4 pack halo tops so they can eat my taint
I used to save meme on phone
Don't anymore
I just stopped caring
Memes have gotten pretty bad anyways
So I never need to “find” some
Been bad for a while
Oh I have never dabbled in major memes
I just follow fandom shit
the word "meme" has lost any and all meaning so whenever people say it i don't even know wtf they mean
Lost meaning not rlly just expanded
Not really
thats why faggot is considered bad
meme is gay and anyone who says meme isn't my friend
Ohhh don’t say that plz
The meaning never changed I think
Meme's definition hasn't changed though
No it hasn't
Once you go farther than the 19th century it doesn’t matter
that has never changed
In that sense we never changed
9gag is terrible

I don’t get scoops from there only pints, so I’m wondering if they’ll put it in a bag for me lol
Smh where has hospitality gone

no it doesn't
just haven't tried hard enough
if you havent stood on the edge of the world
I will fuck her harder next time
clearly u havent walked far enough
evolution is stupid we're just on the very unfortunate end of it. self awareness
2 miles away
Hate being self aware
this dude talks a lot of shit on scat fetishes for a self confessed autopissdrinker
ugh
did you know there is a wrong way to pronouce squirrel
there's a wrong way to pronounce everything

Can’t find the sick meals anymore
people pronounce this wrong
Oh my
Wym u don’t wanna play 4tnite w the Bros Howdy

Doesn’t
oh
i dont think chromebooks like exe's

Can’t do it
Couldn’t do anything except gmail and cry
chromebooks suck
rip
Last played in 2017 😭
rip flash tho
I’m trying to find my wishlist
Oh
Wtf is forgotton Anne and why did I want it
I was alive then wtf
is what you want
most games are solo tho
Ok isn’t very convincing lol
Never tried horror b4
if you play horror with friends it is still scary but not scary in a bad way
e.g. the I can't sleep now way
ron, u know if u need food u can reach out to ppl to help
he just gonna starve to death
But it’s the buying food thing I’m currently stuck at
Not a bad idea
starving is a bad way to go
no but really
Idk I never really played a game
But never actually played many
yes I also wish to know what that is
Seeing friends games like “oh I want that”
bad
Well I need a device to pirate on
don't pirate though
bad
do pirate tho
Cheaper tho
dont let the bastards make u pay
we aint made of cash out here
will you though
I don’t pirate from indie
Ye now that I have money
Idk most of the games are console games I think
last of us
that shit ps4 only
don't buy next gen consoles when they come out
Need it
It’s the air I breathe
The money I saved
I thought I liked shooter games but idk
Oh yeye
shooter games are competitive and competition makes you mad is the way I go
nope
portal 1 short as hell
i thought it was also pc
rip
don't mention that here
Isn’t that the game that makes ppl mad
It didn't make me mad
you dont not reccomend dark souls
ds2 and 1 are bullshit tho
don't go for those
ds3 is hard but fair
ds2 and 1 are fuck you
fair enough
Plz no hard games
I am bad at games
I feel like I’ve heard the wolf among us
Then I won’t mind them
Isn’t that the Netflix show
Shame
> doesn't work
Rip
I’ve watched so many letsplays tho idk if it’d still be enjoyable for me
Feel like I’ve watched every possible ending with that one
Don’t care much abt the sequel
OneShot is supposed to be good
u do get oneshot tho
so dont mess it up
Oh
Dont starve is survial game w/ some story to it
what kind of survival games tho
depends on the sort of laptop you have though
subnautica is a game where if you aint scared of the deep
it ain't that spooky
I can't get into it though
atleast you arent reccomending something like factorio
what's wrong with factorio
it's not hard
I've spent so many hours on bobs + angels
Idk
I've never liked tf2
overwatch died for me the second I poked competitive
Bc I never play active parts it’s always healer or sniper
yeah you can prob find someone to play any sort of game
fair
The price isn’t bad and I know it’ll be good
if you want to do some co-op chambers, lmk im down
that's portal 2 tho
oh ye
they can price them at whatever they want to
b/c they get a 100 percent cut
so, they end up v cheap
Wow I can’t believe you’d put me in quotes like that
The last 4 quotes are mine omg
5 omg
Can’t help what I’ve been born with
oh
Oh for @2waynice
Still a hard maybe tho
you know how ur supposed to have a dominant eye
both of my eyes have decided they dont want to be dominant
which would explain my terrible hand eye accordination
I just assume that my left eye is dominance I can only wink with my right eye
like a did the test i got and it just didnt work
Worked fine with my left eye
But bc I can’t close my left eye and keep my right open I couldn’t try that
i have to think about it real hard if i want to switch eyes
used to not be able to
then I tried real hard and could
That’d be sorta hard
cuz everything got a weight to them :thonk:
Unfortunately it is normal sized blanket
it's cold and you have a lot of blankets
i prefer the cold tho
No I hate warmth
I hate heat as well

i dont rlly get cold
too fat
Even when I’m hot I use blankets bc I’m scared
far too much blubber for it to get through
I can't really sleep without blanket
since I need to be covered
Feel that
You guys don’t have the little mattress topper already in it?
Oh my

I want a hotdog

i would die of laughter
I'll shit on whatever I damn well please
cuz it's inherently a scale

I don't think facism is the third wheel of capitalism and communism
as the last 2 are economic and facism is more of a social structure
i wasnt alive then
facism probably leans more towards communism so far as government regulation of the market
and we probs wont make it to these 30's either
not sure if ill make it to the 2030s either the world just keeps getting spicy
they last pretty much forever too

I haven't had to use an alarm once
I have an 8 am class too

I’m definitely not ready for the chem quiz and math test
Rip
i've given up on trying to understand these quizes
the math test tho means its all over for me
Anything under 65 is sweater weather
Although the comfort sweaters provide are for any weather
I ain't wearing sweaters at 60
im still out here in shorts n tees, its far too hot for anything else
fair enough
so, afaik we need to know things about limits for this test
Chem quiz in 5 mins
Don't need to show work
math isn’t real howdy
You don’t put the limit in the calculator
I dont have a c button here
Doesn’t everyone wanna know that?
Math is fake
why need to know math when calculator exists
I dont think add subtact mult and divide gonna help much here
My singular braincell died, so i hope my random guesses end up being right
I spent like 10 minutes trying to figure out why the last question didn’t have an “or equal to” thing

I was raised American just doesn’t seem right
Still spell grey with an e tho
That won’t go
isnt gray a name, grey a color
That would work if I watched dw in 1st grade
But unfortunately I did not
Mandela effect would work if I didn’t have multiple assignments where I got points off for spelling it wrong
but ur parents arent brits afaik
cuz that do be seeming odd
damn brits
i'd think they'd lose the accent tho
My dad not so much but my mom was raised Proper
since i assume u were born in usa
My parents still spent more time in Nigeria than American even tho it’s been almost 20 years
that seems less than ideal
who wants to be american in the streets
Dunno how to do it in the sheets
in china if you run someone over
Canada tho
cheaper to pay for death
Mercy killing
french canada can suck my ass though
french is the worst language
they don't even know how to speak it
such a pain in the ass
the french cant speak french :thonk:
b/c french hard
dunno
nope
The accents that come with dead languages tho
depends on how dead tho
cuz latin doesnt have an accent
cuz well
its dead
i wish i had a cool accent

that wasnt a real thing ron
The two made a videotape when they met on 9 March 2001 in Meiwes's home, in the small town of Wüstefeld, west of Rotenburg an der Fulda, showcasing Meiwes amputating Brandes's penis (with his agreement) and the two men attempting to eat it together. Before doing so, Brandes swallowed twenty sleeping pills, and a bottle of cough syrup, likely causing an effect of slowed breathing and extreme tiredness. Brandes initially insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work, and ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove it. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw but could not, because it was too tough and, as he put it, "chewy". Meiwes then fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine, and garlic; he then fried it with some of Brandes's fat, but by then it was too burnt to be consumed. He then chopped the penis up into chunks and fed it to his dog.[1] According to court officials who saw the video (which has not been made public), Brandes may already have been too weakened from blood loss to eat any of his penis.
Meiwes then ran Brandes a bath, before going to read a Star Trek book, while checking back on Brandes every fifteen minutes, during which time Brandes lay bleeding in the bath. Brandes continued to drift in and out of consciousness before finally collapsing again. After long hesitation and prayer, Meiwes killed Brandes by stabbing him in the throat, after which he hung the body on a meat hook. The incident was recorded on a four-hour videotape. Meiwes dismembered and ate the corpse over the next ten months, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes and consuming up to 20 kilograms (44 lb) of the flesh. According to prosecutors, Meiwes committed the act for sexual pleasure.[6][7]
no one wants my body
eating a human is really bad for u tho
it's probably bad for you mentally
nah mostly bad physically
Don’t eat fishe, return to fishe
The unprecedented case has proved problematic for German lawyers who discovered that cannibalism is not illegal in Germany.

Instead, they have charged Meiwes with murder for the purposes of sexual pleasure and with "disturbing the peace of the dead".
i want to cut out chicken next year and be a pescatarian
cow deserve death
or just eat whatever u want, since we're only here for like .0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the life of the earth

Fix it lolol

eugenics ain't even german though
Badass fighter aircrafts all due to German ingenuity

Something due to electicity according to sarah
den used to come in clutch during exam weeks
especially past midnight when nothing else is open
i know nothing
Is it finals week for someone?
i wish i was closer to eurowafel
just sleep outside of it
@howdy_. i have 4 exams and 1 quiz from thursday to monday
no it wasn't at all implied lol
i didn’t think it could get so negative man
Giving poor student smooth brain and rot
I am not moving from under my blanket
If I still see it in the morning I’m moving out
I mean, you have a 2nd room you could camp in
I fear opening the other side of the bathroom and finding a dead body or smth tho
Both very scary
If it was dead you'd smell it
Cant mistake stench of death
But that doesn’t rule out the human sized bee
That is scarier than a dead body
I totally forgot that was a thing in dw
Now how does that make you feel?
Bugs should just die
Don’t need it anyway
Hope it aint zambies thn
Zombies would b fun if I weren’t so scared of everything
I do be trying to sleep tho
Oof I have an 8am class
Can’t do that
I won’t get myself cupcakes for that 66
Ron we have to stay awake as a collective body of society
Congratz on ur bio quiz tho
I’m on the sleep shift of the communist cycle wym Zhanda
Fat **F** for nursing tho, sounds like my chem quiz score except 66 points higher
Thats some bs if they dont
Fair enough
RIP nursing
RIP cwru students
Exam is next week that do make me nervoos tho
But as long as I don’t hit that 72, I will Survive
OMG
Rip
Any questions? Too bad
according to daddy drew
they are an indicator
cuz it's gonna be the same on the test
just more questions
Bio exam was 57 questions in 55 minutes
> Bio exam was 57 questions in 55 minutes
@mootdoot imagine chem being like that
it was on their bio 376 homework lmfao
Reading that hurt my head
smh my head
I was so close to sleep
Then I got spooked by this stupid balloon
Rip anatomy class I’m not going to make it
and you were wondering
who would be scared of a balloon
now close discord and sleep :p
Wow now I’m never going to sleep again
Floating would be fun tho
But is it bc it’s inside or outside?
it's inside you
Hope it lays eggs or some shit
ain't that called oviposition or somethin
*you're having problems with the timing quizzes? sucks*
@howdy_. what that's what it's called isn't it
What kind of nerd wants to lay eggs
who wakes up and thinks, "Man, I wish I could have eggs laid inside of me"
uh oh
only frats would advertise during a fucking class
drew barely teaches as it is, and then someone interrupts to advertise their frat
smh my head
and then someone straight up got taken by his friends on camera and someone was moaning into the mic🥰🥰 good times
thats still scummy
yeah people need to focus during class
I have never had a disruption during class I think
one girl in my game theory class started speaking very loud mandarin and we had to stop for over a minute before she realized her mic was on
the host can mute ppl tho
my philosophy is just never turn mic on
who needs mic n camera when u could not
i don’t speak unless spoken to man... i stay far away from the unmute button
hope u dont press the spacebar then
i only use phone zoom
ye, in pc it unmutes u
i couldnt imagine using phone zoom, how else am i supposed to watch yt during class
> I have never had a disruption during class I think
@mootdoot me neither
i wanna kill chris
kill! kill! kill! -math for some reason
I have the big sad
what happened?
Math test happened
he should have curved, but didn't
i mean idk with 121 but
im shocked he didnt curve tho
this school doesn't believe in 3.5s for whatever reason
bad chris
i mean i think if u do the math, 5 questions wrong and ur screwed
what does the test fail you at?
you would have to get more than 10 wrong to fail
fair enough
so jenin and raunak, how did chris kill you with this test aswell?
sarah, math is fake
math is fake but so am i
> this school doesn't believe in 3.5s for whatever reason
@2waynice what's a 3.5

@chandachan i wouldn't be upset over an 88 if quizzes and tests weren't literally the only thing that determines our grade
Oh dang Fr?
exams in my medsurg class account for 70% of our grade 🥰
unless you're majoring in math
89.98 do b pissin me off tho
which I ain't
I mean isn't that how most classes work
regular exams 45% the final 25%
i'm majoring in math but i'm also majoring in something else
maybe i shouldn't major in math lmao
😭🤧 hate it here
it’s only the first exam for da class you got this optimistic
why would you want that
Need 73+ to pass whoops
my econ classes are easier to 4 point at 94% and my math classes are hard to 4 point at 90%
not HARD but like
don't care
i kind of dont prefer that bc if u get a 91 u still get a 4.0
I am *losing* money
quiz or exam
No stonks no money no stress
So not that bad
I’m sorta studying for next weeks exam
theyre hard bc u dont know nclex style questions as much

My nap counter has gone up after 8am classes

Not trying to promote bad habits

we cant give out identifying information
Hippa still applies to us tho
yall dont know was hipaa is
Yea hippa applies to anyone working or serving a hospital
Fuck u

We can talk as long as you can’t tell *who specifically* we’re talking about

yes that video where they're like calling her fat while she's knocked out
How r u feeling today?
i did a head to toe yesterady
> How r u feeling today?
@mootdoot  hungry
its a whole body assessment 😠
Ah why didn’t I think of that Ron
> its a whole body assessment 😠
@megmcmuffin22  the joke still stands
last semester i had a patient who wasnt fully there in the head and we were giving her a bed bath and she thought she was at the dentist and when my partner was washing her butt she was like "i didnt know i had teeth down there" and then laughed at her own joke so hard she farted in my partners face
greys anatomy is stupid and wrong because it implies that doctors have personalities
Omg my clinical instructor laughed so hard she farted yesterday
fucking hilarious
lmao wtf
farting isn't real
is just soul leaving the body
I swear to god i pressed the wrong emote
I told everyone I wanted to do peds hemonc and everyone turned around like 😬
if u waste taxpayer dollars and then just dont pay taxes it equals out
But you doing God's work by assisting these children
couldnt be me
Nurses just give them to patient in hospital
in your nose right
when someone overdoses ?
have u tried smelling salts
like how do you feel after you smell
I've always seen powerlifters smell some salt before attempting something like damn that shit gives you superpwoers or something
I have my box of narcan but have never had to use it
is it cold
they only work I do is im-patient
I think we mostly learn inpatient stuff, although Me’Chelle was saying that case is getting more into clinical settings idk
Oh I thought in terms of classes
now how does that make u feel
a lot of ppl used to go to the va for psych but i think they stopped letting students come
Rip to all vas everywhere

Shit hot as hell
wtf
I hope so, i dont think mine was ever on
he cant touch it tho

as soon as he does, his dad will appear behind him
oh shit
the radiator is connected though
Is that the thing on the floor by the bed that won’t let my bed hit the wall?
smh my head
Bruh ive been living in 80 the whkle time due to this Damn radiator lmao
So the thing by my bed on the floor that won’t let my bed hit the wall
I want to make microwave popcorn
I have to leave my room
Don’t kno why you have to think about it
If I don’t kno what a radiator is,
I feel like they’d murder me bc I don’t know what a transporter is or smth
its hard core nerds
they couldnt muder a fly
But at least I won’t have to buy 5
Why would you buy one when you can’t resell games digitally
because it is due
its due tmmr at midnight right
i want popcorn
Piano gonna go brr
Sorry :p
Trying ez pieces
Cuz I don’t play piano
Yeah I’m trying to get back into classical with some Bach inventions and Rachinamoff
In the meantime I’m trying to figure out this
I forgot to sign up for lessons 😔
maybe some sick drums idk
Drums are my weakest instrument rip
I suck at drums
that's why they are sick
sick as in bad
Flight of the bumblebee
I can do most of it by ear but slow
That’s crazy I suck at aural shit
tends to happen when something isn't a word
like aligning chakras and shit?
like hearing shit
I play that iPhone ringtone every time I see a marimba
Being bad at aural stuff rlly sucks bc I love playing World Drums and those do not have Notes
And I don’t have the patience
whap it hard enough and it'll work out
if you whap hard enough
Broke a drum I mean
That seems to be universal
I feel so bad for them
well I mean I guess you can't do anything but wince most of the time
the original got set to private unfortunately
The great thing about the percussion sections is that there’s so many pieces so somethings bound to go wrong
Times when someone didn’t check the stage on positioning before we went on so everything’s in the wrong place and it’s a mad dash between rests to get to our next instrument
yeah that happened a lot when I was in percussion
I remember having to hold up a drum for someone while he played bc he didn’t check if there were enough drum stands before we went on
It’s the little things that fuck you over
There’s never enough percussion players for the pieces conductors want to play lol
our school was the opposite
it was kind of weird, we had so many percussion players in concert band even with auditions so a lot of us didn't have parts for most songs
My favorite times is when we really don’t have enough people so some overeager brass player gets to play the cymbals
and they never play them right
if you have to play cymbals, don't just clap them together
They’re like ooo it’s the clang clang things and it’s like no bro there’s an actual Technique I’m sorry to break it to you
And we were like “🧐 that doesn’t sound right”
Not to get political or anything, but what the fuck is a Nintendo
I don’t even play violin and I’m saying that
Ouch
violin make wrist go very bad if held wrong
I used to press too hard on cello
almost permanently hurt myself
Poor wrist
I just try to play softly most of the time on keys and stop if something hurts
the worst music I've heard is modern trumpet music
sounded terrible
yeah while the kids who run the server are away, I've been doing a ton of Among Us on there
imagine staying up to 1am to take an exam just to open the exam and find out that the access code the professor gave was incorrect
couldnt be me
@franklin5601 you had to take an exam at 1am?
it opened at 1am, but looks like i'm taking it tomorrow now....originally wanted to clear out tomorrow for ochem since ochem exam is friday
anyone awake and wants to play among us ?
Oh
i had a group playing earlier but not anymore lol
The balloon moved when I slept, and when I woke up just now, it was right behind my head
Oh
My parents send me death threats
Rip
Ok maybe not death threats but they also don't send me edible arrangements
Smh I want gross fruit too
But I’d still like, prefer a cookie
*Everyone Go Get Your Flu Shots*
Jenin rip
Flu is a dem hoax
flu shot

I have a paper due in which I’ve to use MLA formatting
If someone could *gently* explain whatever this means it’ll be really helpful
Free flu shots at veale for like the next month and 1/2
but cant hurt to put them
at the end u have a work cited list
if they’re asking for Mla just do everything do they can’t get u
may i suggest easybib or some other citation machine, cuz doing that by hand suc
Why can’t I just submit a normal essay format
Smh my head
So I just need to fill it up
mla and chicago are the two used in college mostly
I have never used Chicago in my life
damn, ive never used apa
i've never used or adhered to essay formats ever and i've never heard anything about it
i've been in college classes and like english comp classes and not heard a single thing about it

If anyone wants to use Masterclass they’re having a deal where it’s $1 for a year for college students
> Indian flame is closed from 3-5 this is so sad

idk how it works
There’s gotta be at least one college of engineering student in here who already figured it out
> I want to learn how to lockpick for when I inevitably get locked out of my room
@absence000 it's called a chainsaw

Oh yeaaa it’s 5 🏃

I haven't done any h o m e w o r k
but I don't *want* it to be mood
Homework lolol, what is this, high school?
I feel like there’s an area around your house where it’s socially acceptable to wear slides and socks
and either sneakers or heavy-duty hiking boots when I go out
those boots have saved me from puddles so many times already
We won’t be here for winter
you never know
It’ll still be hitop weather until December
or if I need to like curbstomp someone, also good for that
now theres a legit reason
I left my People stomping boots at home
I just got boots for when it rains and there's puddles everywhere
Get that cold feet everyone talks about
but when my feet get wet they aren't cold
my mom used to tell me that if I jumped in puddles, I'd grow fungi all over my foot and they'd have to cut it off with a scalpel
I'm still afraid to this day
ur mom really doesnt like puddles smh
Bruh I just want to leave and get food why are people calling me
No even worse
grandparents 5head
I mean these sets aren’t legally or biologically related to me
I want food 😭😭
“I can’t hear my granddaughter. Is anything wrong?”

Well I do get sick a lot so

You can randomly type potato or some shit and I’d die of laughter
Fuck?

And won’t have to worry when I don’t call

Cause it’s bad
And I don’t like it
u bad
blanket statements are bad
it's like saying you don't like food
> And I don’t like it
@raunakwastaken why
don't just say "sounds bad"
not for an entire genre you ain't
blanket statements are bad
OMG
stan worse
I just think blanket statements are bad
ye
u need a valid reason
since it's such an encompassing genre
be like me saying "I hate rap" or somethin
and generalization bad
they ain't tho
generalization bad
there are some conspiracy theories of how composers died in the past
they died of being nerds
fair nuff
"I don't like music without words" is valid
"I don't like it b/c it's weird"
i don't like music without words is a dumb opinion
not really
"it doesn't have words" is objective
Ok wow I can’t argue at 4am
Damn optimistic
y'all
i am saying all that after studying it
pop and rap do be a little too boring
generalization smh my head
You really finna diss Katy Perry 😢
and trap at this point is gay but ppll who are like all rap is stupid are themselves stupid and just proving they haven't actually dived into the genre
Shit is lit
will i tho
> chords go in a loop-----
@kaori_flute not all pop does that though

Bc it def wasn’t the food
someone on it says "is" and the other person corrects to "izze"
OH

I got soup but I can’t eat it until im back home ;-;
Need pot
Well I didn’t bring pot bc I was “packing light”
But idk shop
Too late though the soup is with my mom back in Chicago 😭
Don’t eat pork rip
Through my sages class I learned that pigs are the earths vermin
There’s Too Many Pigs
Can’t kill the wild pigs at a fast enough rate to make them not be a menace
Hilarious really
well thats cuz everyone wants bacon, and then some piggies escape
and then that causes problems
there's a reason why most pig farms are isolated
so KIDS don't get in there and get themselves eaten
i was stuck with a pig in it's pen for about 20 minutes when I was like 5 years old
my parents still have the pictures
Indiana doesn’t exist wym
because I just don't think any other pig has the muscle to handle it
no offense to anyone that doesn't eat pork
Still don’t eat pork tho
Why don’t I eat pork?
Oh
let them die
Well it’s just the sad remains of my dad being raised partially Muslim
i think they were trying that movement a bit ago ron
He converted decades ago and yet, that’s the one thing that stuck
aparently the police dont like being killed
Idk hard to break the habit
What if I eat pork and die or smth, that’d be so sad
dying is a sign of u need to eat more :P
Nah he doesn’t care, it’s not even something that’s been explicitly mentioned in our family, we just never ate it
but never known it
thats what they want u to think
i assume you don't eat bacon either?
Still love em tho
Nope
well u didnt die
Omg
they aint doing much anyways xD
I’m starting at my bones poster u are Correct
Fall festival big sad
Omg noooo all my winter festivals will be cancelled
my town due to it's rather sizable asian population
Close enough
i live a few miles away from it
isn't riverside near the south right
I towered up and put bed and haven’t gone back since
ron, playing mc at this hour is how u look up at 6am and realize u havent sleep
Terrible
i dunno
sorry dad
i've driven there, but never from LA
My bones can’t survive less than 8 hours of sleep
my eyes hurt again
i cant help but feel that if u drank milk, this wouldnt be an issue :P
if you don't go to sleep
Jokes on u I’m already asleep
goddamn i miss ice cream
i just eat the pint. if it didnt want to be eaten, it shouldnt be so bite sized
i fucking miss ice cream
that's why I got so much of it last year
since when did I have doubts?
I mean I still miss home ice cream
mitchells fucking delicious
and those doubts have since been vaquencished
Man I miss bubble gum ice cream
not too hard to finish
don't remember
Big sad
used liquid nitrogen though
I haven’t tried it yet
but DAMN if it isn't good
so it's still open...
i wasn't sure if it was, given Covid an all
some ppl went a few weeks ago said ppl werent wearing masks there
Oh man this would be the perfect time to get a drink while it’s still mildly cold
damn
that sucks
I keep saying I wanna go to eurowafel but they open too late to combat my laziness
i went there once, when we swapped Mitchells for it right before Covid hit and we all had to go home
But they open so late
i was in there last year
there were... problems
Define problems
Rip
so for like 2 weeks, we had a trashcan collecting water under the pipe
2weeks?
i've never seen a cockroach irl
you'd think they'd make that a slightly higher priority damn
i don't remember when it got fixed
they don't exist in this particular part of the country idk why
really, they dont be in michigan :thonk:
seems suspect
I am Asleep
and used poison to kill a bunch too
if i see a roach it's on site and i keep an uzi on me at all times for that very reason
the apocalypse won't kill you but i will
although I don't like being around them either
they still shock me
I have never seen jumping roach
oh i think i yeetd out of the server that had the cockroach emotes
they thrive in urban areas but they also thrive in the south
so if u live in like atlanta or nola or such cities you're literally having to clean out dead roaches from your house regularly
I hate living in the first floor for many reasons
my middle school was infested with all manner of bugs
> I hate living in the first floor for many reasons

get that fucking rainbow roach out of my face
he probably got it from his parents, not like they gave it to him but he probably stole it
:death:
that wasn't a fight
he didn't
he was a 10 year old kid who had never been in a fight before
i got to second degree black belt in tae kwon do when i was in middle school and i don't remember a god damn thing
i've never needed it
cause i have brass knuckles
I never took a fight class but I have legs for days
you don't wanna get into a fight
it sucks
um u think i dont know that howdy the number one rule of tae kwon do is avoid fighting at all costs
I don’t fight
i didnt even need to pay them to learn that
I have never fighted in my life 🥺
i've only been in 2 fights, and i cant say i'm v good at it either :P
Never fighted in life 🥺
I have never fighted 🥺 wym ✨
i don't fight dirty cause i have good form and i'm really tall
i don't
i've never taken a self defense class
OMG FOUND THIS
i dont think amazon knows what a brass knuckle is
i'm really cute so i don't wanna get in fights if i don't have to
Fightings bad✨
Baby don’t hurt me
I don’t remember anything from aot
WILD HORSES OUT IN RAIN LMAO

Thing is I didn’t get into a T10 college. The closest I got was getting waitlisted lmao
Atleast you didn’t get straight up rejected
T10 college sounds kinda lame
v boring sounding name
It was the one T10 college I applied to that didn’t straight up reject me
Too late they won’t change it
i propose, howdy's school of coolness
if they tried to change it to case university the board of trustees would have a meltdown
the board of trustees have never done anything useful b4
Uhhhj optimistic you tried yo buy your way into USC so stfu

I wasn’t even planning to go on their waitlist
Then how’d you end up here
But idk someone I ended up here

some guy made a very stupid claim on another server
Unless the server somehow involves the movement of money
yeah this guy is full of shit
And fuck his shitshiwrt
he also keeps bragging about a 200k sub youtube channel that I looked up and was obviously subbotted
he claims to be a highly decorated trumpet player yet he has no understanding of time signatures
he wanted people to record a song in 14/3, and when I asked why he put a 3 in the bottom he said he wanted a "triplet feel"
hang on he's made all sorts of really really stupid claims on there
Here are some of his most stupid claims
die
I have microwavable popcorn if anyone wants some
i need food too ron
Awww

Shit smearing
I don’t think we’re allowed mini rice cookers
I brought microwaveable packs of rice tho
zhanda ur 2 seconds from getting shit flinged at you
But w ramen and chips and salsa, they are two meals that don’t require a microwave
Damn I might just find a one serving rice cooker then
rules were meant to be broken
Ig as long as it has auto shutoff they can’t complain
Oh that too

Bruh 8am is too early to take an exam
dunno
Bruh when I visited cwru I didn’t like how we were right by an unsafe area
Yet here I am
*still not in Cleveland though*
That mountain looks pleasant tho ngl
It’s sad that you don’t get any of my jokes
Can’t believe i woke up early and walked to Yost
Just to find out student employment is by appointment only :Gundma:
the old tv that always ended with -vision
me during math quizzes
ngl this is me when after two hours of sitting and waiting for my professors to fix the problem, they cancel the exam
Chem is gonna kill me
I drop a tiny bit of juice on my mousepad n all of a sudden it is the Big Broke
back in my day i could punch a typewriter and it would work better!
they need to get their shit together
The TA’s need to chill with their grading fr
Drew doesn’t give extra credit though how
Now I can feel worse than bad
I don't take 111 that is how
Oh damn
Damn
Y’all I’m worried about bio
My chem teacher sucked in hs but self study got me through the ap
Just don't be ez pz
My CS class grade
Like I could’ve gotten a 100 on my homework but my TA found excuses to take off points
It’s homework
Homework still work
Does sound kinda wacky tho
I personally don’t think she justified her comments but ok
Still bs
Like I didn’t do well enough on the bio exam
I don’t know if our exams are weighted but our exams are worth a lot
Yeah rip
Wtf
If so they're really shooting theur shot early
Oh
I'm 30 percent on one exam
I wanna know what my bio exam grade is but I don’t wanna know
I didn’t think this past exam was terrible though I don’t know if I did well
Don't even remember what the class was
Now we’re starting gas laws
I still don't really get redox since my teacher was so shit
I hate how ambiguous bio is
But I was never taught it, my teacher did that inverted classroom bs and swallowed the mic
Rip
Didn't teach
My teacher was sick all the time
Dunno why
And then took 3 days off every time someone criticized her
Damn
She was very qualified but didn't teach
I think my AP chem teacher was initially a microbiologist but she was not good at teaching and was always sick
Even though she’s decently young
Damn
I’m just bad at technical sciences in general
Imagine being bad at just one
I think I'm bad at bio cuz I just don't give a shit
Though I've never really done it
I’m just stupid and overthink everything
I wish I was booksmart
imagine having close to or above 100%
couldnt be me
Thing is I need to trudge through bio with flying colors
I didn’t have many assignments til now so a 100 was easy
Then the exam happened
Now I feel like I didn’t live up to the TA’s expectations in the FRQ’s
pvnrt isn’t redox
Broleta stop fucking around with me
you need to go to the lab and titrate something
i didnt do anything
i do nothing and get yelled at
makes sense
Dylan was writing something for the past 10 mins and he came up with “I didn’t do anything”

It means my bad
Oh

What if I stopped taking bio notes
What if I dropped out of college
I would never see my parents again but that’s just part of the vibing
Same though
Though
Since I never fail to disappoint them✌️😌
Just kidding I don’t know if they think I’m a disappointment
I think it’s unrealistic to believe a parent will never be disappointed
But there’s a difference between normal levels and wtf levels for sure
You shouldn’t be
I wish to speak with the ceo of small brain
Sorry I said small brain

I keep getting 4/5s it’s very annoying
That quiz didn’t murder me
i got so many 4/5's tho
I’ve gone back to religion
i dont understand this chapter
i don't get learning
Learning about learning do be ironic tho
too bad it isn't helping
We doin it anyway tho 😔
rip
I have learned Nothing
Except training dogs and kids
I will never ever try those methods
I will simply just cry everytime I am in the dark and everytime I see insect
so rip

It's sad to see a lot of kids our age not dress up
I cut out the middleman and just not go
but like I see the people without costumes
"do they feel no shame"
might not anymore
my hs didn't do anything like that
prob cuz people would come basically nude
that's why you never used those stairs
didn't wanna see someone gettin a knobber
We weren’t allowed to do much bc so many restrictions on what we could and couldn’t wear
if you dont got the half naked costumes, whats the point
Stairs are boring
stairs are boring
not much fuck opportunity there
isn't bdsm bible discussion seminary?

@wuhoo4158  hi bored I’m raunak
idk. he's russian
Giys just report optimistic.to campus.police th he has been flinging Shit at people

It’s exactly because it’s 8:45, that this needs to happen
Gotta get it out early
i would prefer to not be awake rn
then sleep 5head
im literally in a class
I too wish to be sleep
there's nothing like waiting 5 whole minutes for a professor to fix a technical issue to remind you that zoom classes are not worth full tuition
Lol yesterday the psychology professor couldn’t figure out to get the pointer on her computer
Couldn’t do iclicker
i dunno what that even is
sounds like something apple would shit out
Not even Apple rip
rip
not too bad
Yea these cases are moving much slower than I thought
i dont think we can go below 3 tbh
Nos sure if we need screenshots anymore
Oh niceeeee
It used to be that you couldn't see  anything from two weeks before except for cumulative data
seems sus
you guys leave campus before thanksgiving
Ok, I don't get how they said they would start surveillance testing for 300 a week like two weeks but testing never went up
I thought they did the first one last week?
which i guess is fair
Oh ye
when ur college announces they're hosting the debate before they announce half the student body isn't allowed on campus
seems suspect
Ppl trying to come in
why are ppl trying to come in
Assassins would b more fun tho
who is protesting a hospital :thonk:
they kinda need to exist
Not hospital
Also this isn’t a hospital, used to b
oh is that happening today?
ready to fail chem and math
Rip
Just don’t show up
how to get the same results with 0% work
If u think you’ll fail, don’t show up
gotta nosefuck the protesters i guess
I was selected for surveillance testing this week so I have to go get my brain picked on Thursday
Rip

It was at thwing last time
oh
there was a time I missed then
😢me wants ice cream
Can’t leave my house
And that’s sad raunak
I disagree bio is worse for me
Also our live lectures aren’t really note-worthy because we watch pre-recorded annotated lectures
So kinda like Drew’s class except it’s still more synchronous than chem haha
when i took flipped chem half the time i didn't watch the videos the night before so i'd just be sitting in class the next day like wut lol
Daddy drew told us not to do that. I can’t do anything against daddy Drew’s words
Plural of money
@raunakwastaken I did because I said you spelled capitalist wrong in your name so how can you have capitalist blood
Then I deleted it thinking I was delusional but nope you spelled it wrong lmao
i pointed that out to him as soon as he changed it and he still hasn't fixed it
it's a lost cause
If he tries to say I’m wrong
it's safe to assume if raunak says something it's wrong
Priyanka if I change my name now it won’t affect my previous texts
> i pointed that out to him as soon as he changed it and he still hasn't fixed it
@2waynice  no you didn’t
> it's safe to assume if raunak says something it's wrong
@2waynice  :Gundma:
Idk
Someone explain me the context
i did though
I don’t
I don’t know a lot of things
Broleta you’re the god of shit
I guess alpha female then???
I don’t even know
I think alpha female would work
I guess so
Raunak you still spelled capitalist wrong
Dylan your statement constitutes a serious infraction of zbt rules
SMH my head

Dylan you’re wrong
Nope!:)

Rip it don’t b loading
I'm surprised he got this far
idk
if a british person says "i need a fag" around me im not gonna flip
and not "man gets suspended for doing clearly bad thing" which is not fun wacky news
Idk depends on what the bad thing is
Like if they ate raccoon babies
that's not a bad thing
don't call yourself wacky if you don't consume raccoon
oh shit oh fuck am i fired
10 bucks says ron doesnt know what afv is
can't domesticate those lil bastards
My older sibling went to a raccoon cafe
Couldn’t b me

Am I not supposed to watch afv?
They can’t be thaaaat dumb
I want to see which Internet comments they pulled
Is the north that doesn’t
There’s too much sugar in my sugar!!!!
and cuz yall apparently think my news is fake
Ppl always get upset about the amount of sugar in things and complain but realize in the early 2000s people already complained about that and got nutrition facts put on website to see how much crazy amounts of sugar you get to eat
Never forget the work ur ancestors put in smh
sugar is worse than fat but the sugar industry campaigned real hard to demonize fat so they wouldn't have to do stuff to make their stuff healthier
Demonize fat And sugar 😡
It doesn’t
You need money
And hard work doesn’t always lead to that
You need Abuse

Its a meme 5head
Also I didn’t see boobies I saw two people dancing
If they aint human
HATE CRIME
I’ve had let’s have a Kiki stuck in head since I readded to library
Hungry games more like it
Smh why can’t I be unhinged with slurs
And don’t like to make ppl uncomfortable sometimes
that was some clever wordplay on my part tho right
Meet me in person tho I go ratata
@howdy_. In optimistic's logic, I'm stating the blatantly obvious, without fear of reproach
i never said anything about furries lbr
oh there he goes
Smh my head
what's wrong with deleting honestly ?
I can’t read that fast I’m dumby
and no i dont lol
do i delete shit all the time
It's not even that hard
why r u so obsessed with deletion like we're all committing our thoughts to the internet for the purposes of google data mining
Of how I cry over anatomy
He got money tho
like even if u delete everything ur messages are still on the server's database lbr
Just in case someone says some sus shit I assume lol
people can even load bots personally and just save logs of everything
omg
See i be saying mean shit sometimes and I have to take it back
i know what u said tho and here go howdy with the receipts!!!!
just LEAVE it
Nothings ever gone, it b spooky
its a good trial for the internet
he always sAYING sus shit
cuz it never goes away
u could literally go searching for my sus shit ive said urself its still on here zhanda
optimistic you be on some next level tuype shit with deleting
i aint even gonna extend that
im fuckin matrix level deletion, im gotdamn IM IN hacker shit deleting
far too much drug
like you be deleting messages just to do stupid shit
I want someone to get into, my lovely personality
The only reasons behind my deleting messages are 1) I said some cringe shit or 2) I said some mean shit
Then just don’t say mean or cringe shit?
u go to case, we dont have personality besides nerd
becayse optimistic keeps us online shit
i forgot what the doge one is
YESSIR I AINT DELETING THAT
or mike n ikes really
Omg I want some
I don’t have nearly enough non fruit snack candy
Lemme find it
i assumed they be money laundring schemes
There’s a new cereal bar that opened like right when I left for move in smh
It makes me sick but that’s okay just another toxic relationship for the pile
Never
the only cereal i like is some frosted flakes or cheerios and i've been known to fuck up some raisin bran
going to need to raise those sugar levels
raisin bran is some gooood shit
I don’t even eat breakfast, but when I do
I close cat cafes and open cereal bars
lol
aldi knows wtf they are come on howdy
i just broke
wtf is that placed called howdy
where theres like a target and a walmart and all type of shit
if u knew wtf i was talkin about
why didnt u say it
*supposed*
Don’t talk to me
anyway that place is where the aldi is and its down very busy scary highway
howdy u stay trying to fight me
i get the sense that cle kinda boring
Never noticed a vague vibe before???
its like he hasnt watched the tourism videos smh
That it maaaaaay be boring
malls died out in the 90s
Oh ye that
its like nothing nothing nothing veterans club nothing shitty restaurant chiropractor optometrist nothing
Is it protected historically? I could draw a dope statue to sit there instead
There’s Nothing There
no head
later after theyre gone and we cant notice
nope
i never said bitch
*he hasnt thought of that yet*
y'all aint going to sleep because freddy kreuger or some shiiiii lmao ?
Oh god they’re moving to online form
end this fucking world
Bruh is my head hurt or stomach
Smh I hate collusion
literally he edited my message and then said he didnt
fucking inspect element ass
fuck u
fuck you too
Find someone else for that
well ron too bad, we didnt get any other volenteers
I can't delete messages
What’s the point in deleting messages when I can just doctor shit and frame u
deep inside the membrane
Optimistic ain’t gonna talk to u anymore lol
the racist edit is still there!!! zhanda wont delete it!!! and its doubly bad considering the large population of asian undergrads at case
hes so concerned about ppl using messages on discord against him but he's coo to doctor messages from other people
for shame
Truly shameful tho
Shame bell from got gif
this shit despicable
Fr tho
k its gone
Do b deleted tho
cuz out bodys suc
Can’t make Howdy do work :banhammer:
from here to the end
No make howdy do work
howdy can u delete messages in deleted bc i just dont want that picture in there lol
Fuck sleeping
honestly ron obviously i agree bc my stupid dumb ass is up rn
I just don’t get how my body almost cried then didn’t and was like alright let’s stay up for 8 hour cycle again
i've had 1 foot in the sleep since i was born
constantly sleeping, so u never are awake
That really would’ve tired me out smh me
Hate when the past affects the present and future
me when past me leaves work for current me to do :angery:
literally crying is physically draining bc of all the hormones
theres a reason why ppl say cry myself to sleep
Should cry myself to sleep everynight then
so what i'm hearing is if i figure out how to cry i can deposit the exess testosterone and all that other funky shit into the pillow
crying also actually makes you feel better
it releases loads of oxytocin and natural opioids
like some ppl have a natural reaction to cry so when ur alone and want to cry just do it
Want to cry
Never want to cry
i dont cry bc thats just....not my reaction idk
crying, thats just a waste of salt smh
But there isn’t many things to do here
Cry into food, call that conservation
cant let the salt go to waste
if this school was in chicago there'd be shit to do people to meet snap snap snap
I don’t cry I just punch punching bag wym
There is shit to do here
-ice cream truck
If they don’t come back Thursday then I will cri
i havent had those in ages
I mean my friend at umich keeps talking about it and I am very close to leaving this school for clearly greener pastures
Gimme those stupid ice cream pellets don’t try to sell me anything
why is case dining so shit like fr fr
Oh ic
i dont wanna look it up for more details bc im gonna cry at the superior dining options
Never cared abt dining bc truckload of snacks, just don’t eat meals :Stonks:
if i end up transferring out i'm gonna stay on this server tho cuz i find these convos quite entertaining
that is certainly some different ways to spell business wrong
no the b school
GOODBYE
Also I hate 8 am’s I have sages rn
I NEVER SIGNED UP FOR 8 AM’s
Ecology and other shit are my weakness
I need to trudge through bio
It’s insane how awful I am at bio
Tell her some of your classes won’t be in the morning
Like they just won’t
I can math, chem, and my neuro class is hella easy, but bio? Imma cry
I need to purchase a big brain
Why am I here on discord when I have a sages paper due in an hour
lol you haven’t done the relevance paper yet?
> I can math, chem, and my neuro class is hella easy, but bio? Imma cry
@sprinkles2108  did you just say chem and easy in the same sentence?
> lol you haven’t done the relevance paper yet?
@mootdoot  nope. Neel and I both are doing it rn
Rip
Instead I’m on here
Didn’t know if we had to choose from book or like in general
Priyanka I have my chem test in 2 hours
Imma fail
I still don’t know how redox works so
I learned a whole ass topic 2 hours before my exam
Redox ain’t bad at all
> Redox ain’t bad at all
@sprinkles2108  that’s big brain energy right there
It’s not hard I promise
Priyanka I’m sorry I have to remove you from smol brain gang
JUST CUZ I UNDERSTAND REDOX????
I CANT UNDERSTAND DNA REPLICATION AND MEIOSIS
But bio is easier apparently and I don’t get that🥺
Do you want me to dm you a redox example
I don’t even know
I can’t remember the word wtf
We need to start student brain exchange program
Fair enough🤝
Raunak you want the example or no? @raunakwastaken
Anyone except raunak can have my redox example
the cute ones grew into the tyrannical ones and now i cant walk thru my ranch without taking like -50hp
omg
oh snap that explains why it says they eat everything omg that includes plorts????
i didnt read instructions outside of the basic tutorial they gave
omg
is that why ur supposed to separate them
nope
im going to cliff all these larg rockos just because i want my save file name smh
bc i am making poor margins
yea i realized that like, 30 minutes ago that the monies changed
gather a bunch of a type of plort, but dont sell em till the price goes up
how to save plorts tho
but need monies for that
i swear ive been doing that rip
is there plorts inside the upgrade?
okay it worked guess i was doing ti wrong
but stonks went down rip
theres so many things
that i have not yet Seen
go find out ;)
the music changed that means its bad
it just wants a hug ;)
no it definitely wanted to kill me
dont set me up like this
hug u, kill u, same diff
Howdy how are you on discord when the math class is going on
split screen and dont pay attention
i be skipping math to try to focus on chem
prof: if u have anxiety u may not b able to study well
prof: bad sleep makes u not study well
i love the idea that you feed slimes another slimes shit and they mutate
smh my head
Holy shit its all coming together now
everytime i come back from exploring i see less of them and im like "huh. i coulda sworn there was 10 of them before i left"
and then i went continued save and there were None of them
oh my godddddd
dont, u can recover
I used to watch jacksepticeye play it and man it seems so fun
u dont have to push them
just suck them onto the gun
hate walking
ready to fail chem
smh this 15 minutes between class thing isnt allowing me to immerse in murdering all these rock slimes
10 mins left for chem
Rip me
RIP me
Do we need to wear a headphone?
Wai-
ITS STILL IN 5 MINS
I didn’t
U need webcam and mic
He had access to my laptop microphone
Whenever it becomes available I guess
Drew had it open for us 5 minutes before our class time for some reason
My fall down is gonna be stupid mistakes
Omg I’m gonna fail
I personally thought our exam was kinda easier than the practice butttttt I don’t know how chem 111 is so
I wish
I got on early
Psychology class rip
I was playing slime rancher whole time but rip anyway
It was sooo bad
RIP
cuz im deep inside it
Bruh I don’t even see my score
So low it don't even show
or did real bad
Bro I did sooo bad
How bad you talkin
Super bad
Couldn’t do the last 2 questions due to time
The last 2
Rip
Uhh it shows that my quiz was submitted late
Fml
well fuck
why do drew be so bad
Isn't 105 the same as 111
Oh
Haven't taken it yet tho soooo
Bruh how is my test late
meyers just wanted to give you an extra serving of fuck u
He won’t dock you points for being lAte
PRIYANKA IT IS HAD FLAGGED MY TEST AS LATE
No he won’t wtf
HOW LATE IS IT
Like 5/10 mins idk
Oh 5-10 minutes...
But that wasn’t my problem
he doesnt respond to those quickly
Then go to his office hours and verbally tell him you emailed him
you cant sign in until 10:35
it simply wont let u
the time ran up on the clock
I guess drew forgot to open the exam 5 minutes earlier for y’all
pri, u dont understand this class
thats not 111 tho
wrong person
I've yet to see this engineering touch
I've only seen bad touch
Mine auto submitted after 50mins from the time I started my quiz
He didn’t take into account the time for lockdown video and stuff
Can I get a refund, I think my teacher is defective, it doesnt teach smh
I still did shit on the test
Im just tryna make you not lose more points
he doesnt respond
Tell him in office hours that you emailed gim
still dont mean he gonna respond smh
pri, i had to go through 3 different SI;s to get him to respond to an email saying how I have problems with the test taking
I guess that’s just bad luck
was there another test :thonk:
cuz thats a rip if there is
since the annoucement about the test i've been trying to reach him
Ok so you could’ve gone to his office hours to verbally tell him
CUZ YOU DID
pri, the mans avoiding doing any work this semester
and I cant blame him
work sucks
Office hours and all that crap
But during office hours?
indeed, any office hour i could attend I made an effort to pop in
so he doesnt
and I cant blame him
So you’re telling me that you sent an email, he never responded, and you went to office hours to express your concern and told him directly that you emailed him?
I'm going to get an arizona and pretend the test never happened
Ok my point is that if he doesn’t respond to your email tell him that you emailed him in office hours
Imma go cry over bio now
I think I have to go to his office hour
I hate bio
If he deducts points for something I couldn’t control imma lose my mind
consider ur mind gone
Bruh I didn’t get a fucking mcq score
I didn’t either
He doesn’t want you to see the multiple choice score
fair
Wanted to ✨cry✨🥰
Oh
*I don’t know
I couldn’t see mine
I guess so
I’m actually depressed over how im so shit at it
Wtf
There's a reason I'm not taking any of the classes
If only I wasn’t required to take bio lmfao
2 physics and 1 chem for me because fuck chem
also fuck taking PHYS 122 in the spring
Imma just skip it cuz e and m for nerds
122 is fucking disgusting in the spring
they make 121 hard in the fall and 122 hard in the spring
no its bc of the way depth is captured on camera
I don't think he meant it was the physics majors fault for you looking like doodoo
Even if I’m smol brain
the mirror: u look mad cute b
zoom: u r a computer duster huffer who lives under an overpass
Don’t ask for help in bio from me though
physics majors take them in that order, so they make it hard on them. in the fall, none of the physics majors except people who did a gap semester do PHYS 122, and and none of the physics majors do PHYS 121 in the Spring
I even said he won’t dock points for a late submission because it’s an exam
lmao a girl had her wifi cut out bc a lawn mower ran over a cable during our calc exam and butler was like "sorry cant help you"
This is why you don’t take Calc 3😌
How is your internet cable
apparently
i had left by the time she rejoined the zoom
well if she was trying to pull a stunt it didn't work
she had like 20 minutes to do the entire exam
i dont know ok

Pri smh my head

No one wants to come to your house
and charge they phone
Dylan leave pri she doesn’t wanna hang out with us
Yea seems like that
smh my smh head shake smh

Pri doesn’t howdy live in Cincinnati?
No need for 8ball to know that raunak is a stalker
U won’t find him raunak
I see someone is subscribing to chem hw
it says cincinnati tho
i cant without doxxing miss howdy
Your name isn’t Dylan?
oh jesus christ i forgot
howdy some chick named zhanda wants you to unmute her??
idk
Not yet
Smh my head
If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't dox anyone on this server without their permission
Dylan what happened to our game tomorrow?
so it doesnt fill up general
Oh ye for cah
When though
if u get bored of that one, azala is a cah site with gif/image cards
but it doesnt follow the typical formatting
there u go raunak, if you want to take a look
the singular titte tho?
Apparently
But I didn’t simp back
Don’t lie
oh
Oh
damn it :/
Awwww
Omg Dylan ❤️
-8ball would i kill zhanda if i got the chance
Oh
ok cuz i dont want a life sentence thT's why
zhanda u wanna get banned so bad
Omg we again got distracted
yea but we need more players smh
Omg Zhanda another Indian reference
There’s bound to b someone
jenin did that module mean nothing to you
i need a gas stove for my hot comb
Hot comb is some bad memories
Horrible days
I am so fortunate that I did not have a phone in those days
Couldn’t find girls with that hair 😔
bitches be like: omgg i so wanna live in the 70s but like i need my phone
Want to live in 70s
i do but i think if i did for like a few weeks i would want to leave
Get tired and call a taxi back to 2020
Don’t need to go back for that
Idk
I don’t care abt Beatles
Idk
But idk who sent it to me
It’s coming from South Korea so I thought it was sibling, but sibling either didn’t buy it or was crossed when buying and no longer remembers
Would b me if not for stupid blood
That can’t form circle
i get anxious when thinkin about smoking weed for some reason idk
Rip
Smoking just seems like an all round annoying thing for me
Would rather consume through slightly sweeter means
the one time i took an edible i went home and fell into a catatonic panic attack was convinced my kitty was a demon who was going to eat me and thought i would kill myself before the night was out
i'm very susceptible to the effects of drugs idk
people who smoke weed with their parents are scary to me
I could never imagine that
Damn okay
Pri is a big meannie so she won’t come
i dont think there's anything morally wrong with smoking weed with ur kids when theyre of a certain age i just think it would be such a weird situation that i would instantly panic if i actually got high
never
my dad is gonna die probably before i'm like 40 and maybe my mom too
I’d never do that with my parents
weird shit
when u were 10 with internet access and your parents were gonna be gone the next day
my mom has been a chain smoker her whole life if she lives to 70 without a terminal illness i will be shocked
and she's also willfully unhealthy in many other ways i won't get into BUT
she gon die
I wish 😔
Wish I had a whip too
ron wtf are u ordering
That was last month
I don’t have money for that expense
u cant get out of this one
ron u dont get fucked up tho
Doesn’t matter it would go straight to him lol
its not illegal to take a month's supply of prescription pain killers in one evening
I mean that’s almost certain death I think
I don’t want any sob story in my dms if you get banned Fr lol
if he ever says this just know that the message will be gone in <1 minute
i leave for like 10min
WE TRIED TO MAKE HIM STOP MISTER :SniffSneezeTears:
smh my head
The horny jail never stops
You can lock me up but you can’t change me
can zhanda go one day without a ban scare
Don’t need 8ball for that
omg
that won't happen unless he's committed or banned
omg say it one more time say it one more GOT DAMN TIME
so sad
God it’s getting so annoying
But if I didn’t buy it
And sibling didn’t buy it
omg what just happened
omg
omg OMG
yes, we've been more than leinient, but this is more than the 3rd time he's broken the rules of the server
I dont mind the game of cat n mouse, but spreading misinformation and photoshopping quotes is a bit too far
this is crazy
one minute zhanda's here causing trouble and being a bitch the next minute he's gone forever
when he inspect elemented my message from that one night i wanted to slap the dog shit out of him
Like this fucking package
WHATS IN THE FUCKING BOX
if i go to yonsei for study abroad next year i'm gonna find ur sibling
Cheaper than the uchi tho
Lol nah we both stupid
If I’m stupid they stupid
Oh I was abt to say bad stonks bc obviously everything is in Korean
But there’s a menu that explains everything in English
knowledge is death
theyre probably asleep
Nah I was on FaceTime with them an hour ago
honestly i dont remember i was prolly fucked up
@raunakwastaken zhanda won't be joining our game
I texted my mom too even tho I’m 100% sure she didn’t send it
I have one other guess but I don’t wanna ask n b awkward rip
but they look like shit u can get at the corner store her
if im getting a box of snacks from korea i want seaweed candy and squid chips
> @raunakwastaken zhanda won't be joining our game
@2waynice  why what happened?
Oh nah I don’t need those
uh oh
Didn’t get banana chip tho, always wanted to try
> when u were 10 with internet access and your parents were gonna be gone the next day
@2waynice  lmao
Why don’t we get fun KitKat flavors smh
Really
Yea like the green tea one I’ve always wanted
AHHHHHH nestle is evil but i NEED TO TRY ALL 200
Capitalism gets u again Aw Man
i mean technically u can get the fun kit kats but i would only do it in the winter so they dont melt
Bad
When u 3 days into a bad cold and can’t feel ur limbs
are jolly scholar hours modified by rona
since there is incentive to update
1:45 am seems sus

smh my head not trusting the bean man

tasted bad
Without sugar
I forgot to add sugar
Dunno abt that
coffee isn't bean curd
doesn't curdling mean like

Aw man I just realized I said I was gonna read one of my books this morning lol
Instead I talked shit played games
*its not morning anymore :P*
Yea really failed today’s goal rip
Ron the reading is so boring
I don’t wanna read about pigs anymore
Oh I wasn’t even thinking abt pig tales lol
Dylan stop beating homophobic smh my head
u know how u taught us about the bad piggies, i was talking w/ someone who met a boar hunter b4
everyone's gay except me
I’m worried why are you excited
fuck cow

legit i dont differentiate between shows laugh tracks and without
a show is either good or bad
I really hate laugh tracks
I won't watch a show with laugh tracks
it does not make a show bad
it just makes me not want to watch it
Any the office fans

office aight
im so over even making fun of office fans i just legit dont want to think about that show ever again
Nope

Damn now I wanna know what happened:(

I need someone to download my professor wants me to download but I can't because my computer is really dumb
there's three .ipynb files on here and I need someone to download and email them to me pls http://www.phys.cwru.edu/~ruhl/P203/python/
whenever I try to open them, it opens the raw file, which I can't use
but my computer fucky
Can't download em just opens
I do feel like the raw files can be used tho
i dunno if that helps at all
did work?
Hot take: computers aren't real
We aren’t real
I was supposed to wash my hair today
And I somehow managed to fuck up both
u played mc tho
Still time In day
That takes 4 hours
I managed to cut it to 2 for college
I can't imagine spending that much time straight on any aspect of my body
A majority of that time is just Waiting tho
It’s not that bad
Means you can't rest head on anything
Both of which I do most hours of day
Oh ye
Gonna fuck up the headphones
The drying takes forever
Why does it need to dry like that
Well I air dry Bc I have no machine
Seems like
I wish I could bring dryer
Why can't you
Bc then it wouldn’t take the whole day
I don’t use the normal handheld ones
Still
Can't imagine caring that much
But what I’m doing at college rn is bare minimum
So what happens if you don't
Die?
Shit pant?
No hair just get real bad looking
And bad smell sometimes depending
Oh
I’ve gone on benders of not washing for months do not recommend
I'd think that leaving conditioner in there for like 30 minutes would make it start to ferment as well
Wym don't want your hair to harden into a spike
No the conditioner needs to stay in for hour Bc follicles are steel wall
car oil
its everything you could ever need
But the ph rip
i wonder if theres a person who never washed their hair
Kill a man
The reason I had a time of not washing hair for months was bc arms didn’t work that one time
I want the devil in my hair smh
That one hurts me bc imagine combing that one day
You lose
Oh God oh fuck he has a fun
Shit
i want gum
It doesn't like you
Wish someone would vore me tbh
i dont even kno why ibrought this gum
vore isnt eating

Couldn't even be bothered to like
Cut it out
Simp aren't real
and they haven’t been removed
technically it still isnt large
im on computer now
And people are leaving the server
but we wont have breaks smh
i want new server
probs another server is my guess

They be lonely
except for @toomanyzs
good for them tho they’re getting on it
i wonder when i joined this server last yr
Makes me feel old already
the person who made our server didnt end up coming to case unfortunately
i hate high schoolers
even the person who made the case server didnt want to go to case
even the creator of case didnt want to go to case
i dont even remember what id id yesterday
let alone the day i got into case
rip
he wanted to
he couldnt come for financial reasons
rip
oh noooo🥺🥺
the second i found out i got into case i was crying because these baby mice we found and tried to foster kept dying and the last one just died very slowly in my hand and i got the email like 3 minutes after that
i react more to dying mice

If you are feeling down, try holding a pencil between your top lip and your nose for five minutes.
A cat’s eyesight is both better and worse than humans. It is better because cats can see in much dimmer light and they have a wider peripheral view. It’s worse because they don’t see color as well as humans do. Scientists believe grass appears red to cats.

I think the online teaching style isn’t helping me at all tho
I did super well in that class by taking really thorough notes, and also drawing and colouring every single diagram and stuf
But Bc everything with the class is so technical I rlly do need to pay attention to what I’m writing
Hopefully that'll come more naturally as you get familiar with nursing terminology and things like that though. You're only a month into a very highly ranked nursing program, so don't be too hard on yourself
Cant trust them

“If the president thinks his best case is made in urine he can have at it. We’d expect nothing less from Donald Trump, who pissed away the chance to protect the lives of 200K Americans when he didn't make a plan to stop COVID-19.”
God she was bad
Idk i'd be interested to see what old people brain pills Biden is taking and how much coke/addy/speed Trump is doing
He's 1. A terrible business man  2. he's got that sniff and 3. in the bob woodward books aides said that he stays up until 3 am tweeting because he takes a shit load of addy
just cuz he's bad at business doesn't mean he don't do the cocaine
isnt his wife dead
isnt like his whole family dead
someone from taft got mcdonalds
:pikathink:
the burger must be feeling cold
rip
@megmcmuffin22 his son and his wife from his previous marriage died in a car accident

they already gave him the trending page what more do we need to give him
Damn jimmy
When does wade close?

I don’t want him in jail with me
Screw Sophia trump is my boo now
Apparently there’s candidate piñatas to bang at at 8pm
I really wish my 145 test didn’t get moved back to tomorrow
beating trump to death simulator
They don’t break either I think

haha, I haven't yet
you need a specific reason and need to call in ahead of time, so I'm making everything perfect before asking to get in so my odds of getting accepted are high
normally when i work i just kind of experiment as i go, and normally the thinkbox is cool with that, but it won't work in this case.
im much more of the experiment w/ everything
I'm hella salty, the other prep software i used (but not allowed there) was open source...
rip
they want us 2 pay 100 a year for adobe, tis a big rip
the worst part is that I'm pretty sure it will export to an open source file format
oh nvm, it exports to some file format i've never heard of
rip
Damn dude you were only supposed to lick the boot, not eat the whole thing
since they are allowed inside
I don’t I’m watching it on TV but c-span is streaming it on yt
i'm supposed to attend the viewing thing and report on reactions for the paper 🤧
Apparently this counts as service hours for ccel

lmfao trump just tried to call biden socialist and he laughed
Hopefully Biden doesn't fall into that sort of character bait and instead capitalizes on the main issues that require attention
man shot in left leg near uc
oh my spotify
hasanabi has 100k viewers on twitch he raking in that debate money

I want to see trump and the moderator throw actual hands
Raw dog
No only bloody knuckles
Then we kill them
fair point
Fisticuffs to death
they are giving tickets to protesters who parked on the streets rip
Trump really dodging all the key points
whatever biden says, he went to a dummy college, so nothing he says matters
no he graduated lowest or near the lowest
They need to do some serious fact checking following this debate
OH MY GODNFKSNCKANC
This debate seriously needs to be fact-checked, i'm pretty sure someone contracted covid in one of his rallies
no big fights happening at hecc yet
THEY WANT THEIR RESTAURANTS
i want restraunts
THEY WILL NEVER RECOVER

Biden wants to increase funding in order for them to be able to have like psychologist with police and stuff
Chris wallace is an elementary school teacher tonight
Bruh Wallace needs an air horn
I mean to be fair, Biden has to respond back to some of Trump's slander

did he die?
me idk
i mean we're all dead
first died during obama administration i think

idk

Speaking ill of the dead. -trump

Lowkey wade seems chill
I'd suck every single dick on this campus to get a job
So I don’t hang laptop upside down

someone messing with your casting
The walk of shame back into the server is such an appealing thought

I did the math and I can only really work 12 hours rn anyway
Unless I really start squeezing out hours
Yea that’s why I’m not too upset abt 10 hours
fair fair
I can basically work a whole 8 hour shift on Thursdays alone but I still need to study and stuff

they can’t be in the same cell howdy
can i fucking
if you need java help i might be useful
if the balance is less than the minus i get false but the bouncedcheckfee isn't applying
you can't use operstors with doubles
wouldn't the top half not work if that was the case
don't doubles have the double.compareto method
fuck
top left of keyboard
would i need the compareto method
its the same thing u fuck
but like isn't the true half also comparing doubles
no that should work
idk
fuck all the python and java have mixed in my brain and i forget which is which but oh well
fuck java
#engineering🔧 might work
i've never heard of that site b4
also the whole if else thing didn't work
holy shit it is
you need to instantiate an object to work on it
damn
why do i need a constructor for this
i havent written anything in java for a while
but iirc when you're referencing and editing variables within a class, you need to make a separate object
im just lost on why the top half works but the bottom half else doesn't
it doesn't look pretty but im 95% sure its not wrong
what part doesnt work?
idk
but ur fixing stuff which assumes its wrong
wait you said the second half didnt work
those were the last 2 functions right
the balance isn't getting subtracted by the bouncedCheckFee
what coding class u in jaffer?
oh dang, fancy
weird I have no idea why it can't find minus
well it's inside a boolean so the name doesn't matter that much
that super didn't work jaffer
idk
sometimes I'm stuck and it turns out a variable is global or something that shouldn't be
@envoke are you sure you dont have a main class somewhere
i dont think i know what that means
i think im just a fucking idiot
what happened?
oh no
well its supposed to be
but as it would turn out i dont think i changed it
if u change it, does it work now?
i dont know how to change it to be right
why isn't
this work
try it without this
hoyl SHIT
but when i tried to set the bouncedCheckFee i wasn't setting it to anything
its been so long since ive coded anything in java
do you now have a working bank account
uh oh
the increment day is the hard part
isnt there like 4 classes or whatever
fuck u adam
its not that bad but its interesting
Fuck you aidan
smh my head
fuck you adam
I literally have a code blog that I never work on
Well you see, I never put the code on it, because it was shit code and I felt self conscious, but I never cleaned it up so idk when it’ll be finished
I’ll fetch the link tho
man i want an ender 3
ender 5s are what the kids have these days tho
hes a fucking demon
a pain in the ass at first tho
wouldnt you want it to be higher
holy fuck
I have a cr10 that I could never get working well
I have half a mandalorian helmet left over from when it got pushed off the bed mid-print
I got a lot of flack for working in telecom...
man i hate people who work in telecom
i just hate them
i have friends, going to IVY LEAUGE SCHOOLS, who didn't know 5g was actually a thing
its cuz they wanted that 6g
it's a bit more of a pain in the ass tho, at this point only a few phones have 5g modems
fuck yea
it's such a pain in the ass man
at this point im only doing it because I like to write, will be v bored over break, and want to look good for employers
those ones are sick bro
dumpster boy doesnt sound right
oh wait that’s sick
dumpster goblin is cool but beck has actually called me a goblin before and hurt my feelings
fuck you beck
but if hypothetically it wasn’t
it’s kinda sad that that is literally me
:cocoyyell: <- me after writing more lines of code that dont work
I actually have nothing to do
danke danke, however i got hw due today i havent done yet so i calling it there so i can write my sages essay
someone ban me
jaffer need a code king role
women don’t understand comedy
yesterday some stupid kid on a server I help run would not stop calling another guy a pedo
for hours
wtf man
we spent a solid hour trying to distract the pedo kid without muting him
we knew that if we muted him, he'd get super pissed off and try to report us or whatever
Eventually he apologized for dragging it out, but it's so stupid
we kno the feeling
Personally I don't want to see him go, since he's a super active community member, but this stupid stuff is way over the line
hang on I have a list of all the shit he tried to pull
spammed slightly nsfw twerking gifs in #general and told me I'm sexist for deleting them
spammed slightly nsfw gifs of fat people dancing in #general and told me I'm body shaming for deleting them
called people pedophiles at least 20 times from the search function alone
he needs to be sent to horny jail
resembles a certain someone in this server
told new members of the server to leave and that they didn't want them here
really cock
seems to be a popular trend
he wants attnecion
dont give attencion
yeah I don't respond to him anymore
dont engage him
he will either shape up
but he never learns
hes still getting some attention
banning ussually makes them realize that rules are supposed to be followed
will be tricky justifying this to his friends on there though
yeah kinda like when u kill someone they learn its bad to break the law
didn't even notice
damn near full moon baby
i don't think it matters if he's popular
if he continues doing annoying stuff that ban him
Tbh I cant imagine having beef on discord
Couldn’t be me
Oh

But then ppl don’t get what i mean

@_the_intern_ I would like to apologize for not having recognized you and for further adding insult to the injury by butchering your name; my mind isn't working as always :cri:
I WILL BE ASKING THIS THE WHOLE MONTH BUT REGARDLESS IS ANYONE DRESSING UP FOR HALLOWEEEEEEEEN

at the end of spooky month
I just realized the last thing snyder did as president was host the worst presidential debate in history
I’m leaving my bag outside Taplin for distanced trick or treating
Nope
We have uni police tho
One year for haloween I had a giant jewfro, and the day before I had it cut really short
im dying
> We have uni police tho
@mootdoot cleveland had to pay for overtime on cops that arent directly cwru affiliated
Smh my head

Meth tho👀
i passed by there from thwing i didn't see anyone
make your computer burn
only took me 40 mins
the logo has been cut into the pumpkin
activate spin moves then i guess
I tried to make a light inside the pumpkin, but it wouldn't disperse evenly throughout  all the letters
but what shape fits perfectly inside a pumpkin?
the flames are too fast, and some of the pauses are too long
brb gotta engage in class
because i didn't see the server's profile change
I thought it stopped raining months ago
it's not even raining outside
forgot to set this to rgba
do you guys know how discord wants animated logos?
@cupodylan I tried to ping Dylan the other Dylan but
please don't use the other inferior one
oops wrong thing
idk
oh it's in server settings overview
i cant remember name
uh oh you can't see the logo at all haha
you cant really see the logo but its fucking sick
10/10 work
Oh shit that looks awesome
smh sarah needs to get better at like everything
fuck u adam
that wasn’t
The secret code was me standing out in the rain
So just a fair warning to everyone that the exchange rate is one slice of pizza to 2 kiwis
But I want both
Mmm
The fruits that I get just go bad
Grapes don’t work
i don’t have jar tho just plastic water bottle
Don’t need jar
idk how or why but it just do
Oh yea esp if u can’t wash it
But I do have jars tho if anyone want
it’s kinda sad boy hours rn
isn’t that name sick
All I hav is fruit water and that’s perishable rip
i thought it was sick
ok. my bad.
Mines lame
i don’t get it beck
I have Skeleton on wall but for educational purposes rip
oh
but instead of saying howdy when they open the door on halloween
idk man
its just pain
My smol brain still doesn’t get it
java is pain
If someone came to door and said howdy instead of trick or treat, I would simply close door
That one GroupMe meme of babs at picnic table was p scary tho
Spooky scary skeletons and shivers down ur spine!
My pfp isn’t appropriate in that case but I’m lazy
i dont see how it follows the plot of the grinch
this is sick
idk i’m chilly
Omg I have both of those
I am going to drop these whole entire $50 Bc Sad
they dont want the rona
who needs another job, just charge for the cafe
Omg
I still haven’t seen if this other room is unchanged
Smh they’re not paying me rent tho
i got pizza from lil italy once and it was cold and wet
no it was just so damp man idk why
Zomg cat cafe is near west market
algebra tea house 8/10 good vibes was too hot when i went wish i could sit in
or if i have gone anywhere else
also cold
cold room good room
i have bad bonesssss
they tell me this is my prime but it dont feel like it😔
the old ppl tell me it gets worse from here but how much lower could i possibly go
@mootdoot if people tell you it gets worse they're lying; studies have shown that people get happier as they get older
Benjamin button type shit is that
lipton tea sold out😔✊
oh wait what did i miss
Also rip
I have too many tea bags to cold brew to buy iced tea
doesn’t it taste different
I shit myself every time I open discord
nope he just tweeted
fuck really
holy shit
I hope biden doesnt get it
if one candidate were to get too sick or even die idkkk what would happen
cuz having presidents die in office generally is frowned upon
fr tho he will have excellent medical care its extremely unlikely he will die
so u think he has a higher chance of survival given his bad health and age
the way u phrased it made it seem like u thought he would die
worst case scenario is that he is asymptomatic
if he has no symptoms it will add to his “virus doesn’t exist” idea
which will just make everything worse related to the virus
finally able to stay up late for once
@absence000 yeah im just arguing thats its v unlikely he will die
Alabama wants you back
So people won't think too highly of them and stress them out
ive never been to alabama
@chandachan wrong
DONT TALK VACK TO ME OR I WILL WHIP.YOU
Idk
She's all I want and I be waited for so longggg
Fim cant you see
I know it might be wrong but I'm in love with fim's mom
its just late
shame, you hate it when ppl do suicide with two shots to the back of the head
i'm all nighting so i can get back on a corporate sleep schedule
zhanda idk what ur missing from the lectures bc i haven't watched them either
that either
actually no ur wrong
Omg we all nocturnal
I’m studying bio kms
fam staying up late is not nocturnal
> what if he dies :in_love:
@2waynice  no❤️ we don’t wish death upon anyone I don’t care who❤️
yea a few weeks before the election that'll go over
Damn
where's that meme howdy posted ab bragging ab poor health habits
I feel bad because some people have insomnia and I'm just repeat ing nocturnal
@sprinkles2108 if ur not gonna wish death on people then i will
Oh boi
Except the one who
Do you remember trump's cameo in home alone
I can't remebrt which one
miss those days
reagan is dead zhanda
Yeah but still
nope
Smh my head
I just didn't expect the president to spread it personally
And I don’t blame y’all
I don’t think they’ll be sent back now
this is poetically the most beautiful and fair thing that could happen at this very moment
he can't conceivably do that because he said "1 is too many" like 5 times at the debate
im dead
if he's doing this to avoid debates that's scary bc that would leave joe biden to just talk for an hour and a half
i dont think anyone who's not already an avid supporter is gonna see him as a hero
so i don't agree with all that
Also we are too deep into Covid for that to really matter anymore I think
If that happened in like March/April then I could see it
Conspiracy theories are for shits n giggles, most ppl dont take em seriously
ew, i hate british ppl
i don't like the grey on him tbh
RIP Meyer isn’t adding points for the first test
chemistry is gay, just don't do it!
*psst, raunak* how does one overwrite the date function correctly, cuz I think that might be where im going wrong
We only need to override the equals and toString methods
so dont that mean u gotta override 1 date w/ another
I think i'm smol braining at levels never seen before
the account class date i have no clue what it wants from me, so its just kinda blank atm
frick, then something else is wrong elsewhere
Cause of the month names
oh no
papers? served
divorce? finalized
custody? lost

yup, it's gamer time
Your nitro isn’t over?
its not september anymore so the simping brought back more nitro
> Your nitro isn’t over?
@raunakwastaken GOT ANOTHER GIFT
Imagine having a Java project couldn’t be me😌
mm
apparently not
im stuck tho, so im trying to figure things out
cs doesnt stand for computer science stands for cocksauce
everyday you people stray further and further away from god
@howdy_. if ur stuck on a small thing
There is a drop in ta office hour now
I’m still undecided hmmm
i cant figure out 3rd or 4th
the only reason i got 1 and 2 are working (kinda) is cuz of jaffer's big brain
Imma fail for sure
cuz it keeps throwing me errors
You don’t have to write anything
You need a Account object why?
Oh for testing class idk
Don’t (1,1)
well i need to do both anyways
cuz i cant figure it out
no longer
they don't exist
im so dead
i can't code, i have no place in the job market
oh
applied math and economics
when are you going to fix the economy
yea never
am i the only one who doesn't have much homework
i have too many hw man
theres less homework in math class when u literally just don't do the homework
math doesnt have hw
although i havent attented a single math class this week
u dont get any hw assignments if u don't go to class
tbf when i had chemistry i would start my homework at like 6 and suddenly it would be 1 am
but if she didnt check hw u best to believe i wouldnt be doing that shit
This week was pain cause of java project and sages papers
when u think schoolwork be hard and demanding just remember that it only gets so much worse after graduation
idk honestly i remember high school as being so much more intensive than college
hs was like you have 3 projects to do at the same time and 100 hw problems and also u have to do a bunch of ec shit and it has to be good shit or you wont get in anywhere
The java project is screwing me, im close i think, but things still break
i should be studying for my exam on monday rn
what are you gonna do when there's not hot chip left
Cry
It gives me peak energy for 4 hours and then pain
But those 4 hours are semi productive
4hour nrg, i guess caffine still wins for that 5h nrg
Caffine dont like u
Gotta redo what I’ve been doing for the last 45 mins
Oh Oop uncongrats
Aight I just found that I don’t have to test the setter methods
Why dont you have to test setter?
It isn’t
The last coding thing I did was scratch
That program was my shit
Damn
Damn 😔
Howdy this isn’t a communist society
I can’t type
So what you want howdy
Why ur able to not do setter and getter and how to do the increment month if increment day goes over in the account class
Im trying
Its stuck on the rtc connecting
Raunak, when u going to sleep, like in how many hours?
Idk
Cuz phone no likey
Doesn’t sound appealing sounds fake actually
What I meant by that raunak is-
U can’t use what u don’t have
agrees in *this is the average winter weather for me*
I can’t be productive in this temperature
Technology *never* fails
?choose trust computer, not trust computer
-8ball do I trust my laptop
I found this in my camera roll
It’ll work
wiccans are the original larpers, except they took it as reality
👀 trump is going to the hospital?
4 hours
he got there relatively early i thought
Wallace says he didn’t I guess
it’s cold
So cold :cocoyyell:
i like cold but i don’t have my thiccky jacket
I’m dying
Can’t
sorry
wrong person
cuz they way im doing it is very tedious
No format just explain what you expect and copy paste the shit
any help w/ the toString, cuz mine is super long
Which class?
account class
So we have another 3 hours right?
If they aren’t null then append them too
oh god thats terrible
Can’t see your code
But yours definitely isn’t similar to mine
oh no
You can’t
so since i cant really condense it, im in for a bunch of copy/paste
why aren't they letting you make it easier to read?
Aight my dr java won’t open
> Aight my dr java won’t open
@raunakwastaken  I guess I’ll just kill myself
im trying to not fail the class
why is account so little if its the most work
yeah you give it a number and it doesn't cycle through the other code at all
when is this due
Can someone call dr. Java and tell him that his software isn’t working for me and I have a assignment due
if the thing doesn't exist, don't put it into the array
Sorry Me in inglish bad   At 6:30AM
raunak, im trying to figure out the toString override in Account class
You want code
ok so what you do is you first assign all parameters to a giant array by cycling through all the attributes attached to getSavingsAccount() with a for loop
Inside that loop, you check if the thing exists, and if it doesn't just don't put it in
I mean howdy's method works but it takes longer to write
yea, my method is slow, but i understand it, vs the other methods which are more effiecnt but i need to learn how they work
If the Java makes u sad, I can take up to 4 ppl with me for cats lolol
Plz come pet cats, so I feel less bad abt the $50 I just spent 😭
It doesn’t go away?
since u dont submit anything to them

the place where the bread isn't technically bread
doesn't seem that healthy
the real 1 tho should still be open
The one on Euclid was closed
And
Talking about its bread
It’s overall much healthier than the good stuff u get at the den or jolly
Smhmh our standards have gone low
there's nothing wrong with that tho
I’m dead inside
i'm dead on both sides
:dead:

I'm 6'1 and ended up as the shortest one :/
I was trying to be outrageous
dam guess i am the freak man
i can drive it’s not that hard😭
one time i was walking down the hallway at school and this kid bumped into me and he went: *gasp* midget!
i have to study byebye👁👁
i’m still traumatized
Me? I have a cop mustache and nothing else left of my glorious beard because I got bored
I really wish it grew more out than down so I could twirl the ends of it like an 1880s western villain
that would actually be sick
And that was only 2 months
im simply awake
It’s school day
I’m awake bc I’m an Adult
Was that among us tho?
And can do whatever I want
> I’m awake bc I’m an Adult
@mootdoot  
Couldn’t be me
one guy got pissed since when I was imposter I accused him and his friend and got him voted off
Yesterday night among us wasn’t working for me lol
Like for me pink would be dead and for someone brown would be dead
How do you function with 4 hours of sleep?
I wasn’t awake the whole night, I just kept waking up every 30-60 minutes
sucks
> @addat  you will?
@raunakwastaken yeah, if you need to get your fix in india.
Vegetarian tho
so long as microsoft doesn't pull down the ban hammer, we should be good
they stopped supporting 7 a year or so back
It was this year they stopped supporting 7
I should know because I still use it on my desktop
I mean it ain't so much about whether or not they care about xp
I feel like microsoft would do the ban hammer
> 2020 is a few years compacted into 1
@howdy_. this year has gotta end smh
and i pray we never see a tragic year like this again
not coughing cuz i dont have covid lmao
oh
you didn't italicize it
so i didnt know
That didn’t work
I’ve had it set to 80 for 2 weeks now
Definitely doesn’t feel like 80 in there
I've never had issues with the heating, just the lack of cooling
it means that the central heat in the building wasn't either A. working or B. Turned on or C. Both
Bruh I can’t even check if it’s working or not
Its also like 67 or something today, I don't think the heat will even be on>
I was told heat would b on this week it end of this month
the longer heat stays off the better
i have a bunch of homework i need to do but i had a test today and don't want to lol
it should be illegal to have a test and homework due on the same day
wait are u in the hospital still
is it even possible to chill in a hospital :thonk:
idk why that idea scares me so much
honestly get me out of this plane of existence i don't care what the new one is
I think the reason it's so scary is that there's nothing
no monsters, no hostiles, no anything, just nothing
alone
just a surreal, endless, lonely void for you to spend the rest of your life in
nothing is v calming
not lonely wym its gna b me and optimistic in there
its me rolling my iv pump sorry her wheels r loud
what if you hear something wandering nearby and you look for it for eternity but never find it
could be nothing
thats some yearning shit
So status update, managed to be late on my first day of work
late for everything
culture of late for everything
trust me, nothing fashionable happening over here
I’ve exhausted my snacc supply
my hair is so tangled today which is weird bc i always shower then go to bed and it never gets this tangled
dont have hair
no i want it
> my hair is so tangled today which is weird bc i always shower then go to bed and it never gets this tangled
@2waynice no one cares
raunak ur an ugly cunt go die
i was supposed to wash my hair last weekend big sad
Yes unfortunately
holy shit
Cause both my parents got
i totally DONT hope u get pneumonia
dylan, thats breaking rule 10, so pl0x dont
Seriously?
ik we cant do much from the opposite side of the globe, but we all wish y'all well m8
wai-
what happened?
I’m more worried about your grandmother
I'm sorry
Still weirds me out that I didn’t get it. I was like in the same room
Just haven’t been tested
But my sis, grandma and I don’t have any symptoms
keep safe tho, dont want to take a risk
or that the symptoms yet have show up
it's better if they don't tho
that too, but we hope that its asymptomatic over just late
so-
someone from another server said that flu kills them
but 
when they got rona
they were not affected as much
sorry for killing the chat
anyone else behind on work?
i feel like i’m always behind even if i’m not
Oh snap raunak wishing u and the fam good health
@raunakwastaken im srry that was too far, i only said that cuz u upset me just before that
i hope u all get better
Or slightly better Bc sometimes that shit suck regardless
leave me alone :/
I am leaving u alone ❤️
And schoolwork isn’t real
i miss u
Hot n cold icic
hot n cold jus like u ron
Man tell me why I got a fever
Yea it’s probably just my body trying to right itself
But man do it suck on top of everything else
Just need someone to tell me when Taplin heat come on lol
But food isn’t real
why cant they give u a space heater like dont they have one
u flick it off, then back on the moment they leave
I’m just gna stay with family until shit warms up or it’s time to leave lol
just-
don't cause a fire
should u really be doing clinicals with a fever
I’m in hospital bro
I can’t do clinicals
Yea but considering I put all my in person classes on Tuesdays I just come in then leave
Honestly not how I was expecting my schedule to work out
yes raunak
on that note
imma yeet to study
Bye
Imagine studying
Couldn’t be me
Eww Ron you study?
0 braincells * 100h of studing is still 0 score
I don’t study
Wish I was smort and brought school stuff
Bruh can’t people see canvas??
Smh my head
Someone on groupme asked what was in last week’s discussion section
i need mama bird to regurgitate the food down my throat
Bruh I’m legit gonna answer her “idk”
that poor person will fail bcz of u
so r00d tonight arent we
Bruh I legit don’t know what’s on the quiz
So idk
Idk
Cause it has to be weekly discussion
And last week it was gas laws
Yea gas laws 2 is based on previous classes’ work
i just rewatched the last announcement vid
he said last weeks discussion section
so
only that ig
Wasn’t partial pressure pre exam stuff?
idk tho
well
imma study 25 and 28 content
cya
Some of these could be potentially useful, idk I never took chem with daddy drew because I skipped 105 and Sri taught 106
My Pchem Midterm exam equation sheet
Idk if they could use it
I guess that gen chem probably doesn't use partial derivates
Also Raunak if you test positive, and recover, which if it happens, I hope you recover quickly and easily, please consider having your family donate blood plasma
Can’t believe its steak night and I’m not there smh
since when?
Jailbreak hospital edition for some steak
Also the whole side that you can't get to normally has coffee, different types of bagels, spreads, toast, and a bunch of cereal
Aw man just remembered my fruit water
I just want dipndots 😔
And there isn't even any L3
Rona needs to go
I’m already hungry
Isn't it like 1 am for you
go sleep
smh
Like normally you could get chicken and waffles whenever you wanted at the KSL cafeteria
Omg
And also Melt. Rip melt. Fantastic fries
we pay $5 for the coffee house if we want waffles-
Yeah they don't burn the shit out of it so the acid balance is good
aight
imma yeet
getting fat just by reading this
Damn Zach 6'8
Tried to knock.me out
You see nothing :p
@howdy_. You should schedule a seat technically but I'd be surprised if it isn't a big ass line
The line seems long
Does that mean I can leave my shit?
You don't fully move out until the end of the year or a pandemic
Oh well I was expecting to pack everything again since we didn’t know spring schedule
You can take or leave as much as you want. The only caveat is that your room gets inspected to make sure that there is no food and it isn't a trash den
Even  if they did change smth, I’d still b first in line on campus so I’m leaving my stufffff
@howdy_. I think it is come hell or high water at this point. There are other schools that are getting quintuple our cumulative case load per week and are still in operation
shame
I’m pissed
Why don’t freshmen who stayed at home get first priority???
Tf? Like WE haven’t experienced college life let us come
And the president released a statement today that basically boils down to "rona ain't shit" (~~after getting 3 different experimental drugs and round the clock monitoring from some of the best attendings in the world after his first sniffle) ~~so be prepared for collapse of regulation
well pri, they already got ur money, and kno ur still going to pay
God damn it so we actually may get sent home next semester
Who in here is remote? Will y'all go with campus-housing or not? And WHY do we have to decide by Oct 12th? Without knowing our schedule yet?
> Who in here is remote? Will y’all go with campus-housing or not? And WHY do we have to decide by Oct 12th? Without knowing our schedule yet?
@Deleted User  I’m remote and I said I’m going because I wanna get my spot. And they just wanna know the numbers early on
> Also Priyanka, I think that’s a pretty clown take. You had the option to come this fall, but you declined to. These people were forced at the last minute to try to keep up their responsibilities and find a place to live so they could complete research projects, mandatory in-persons, capstones, etc.
@toomanyzs  ok that’s fair I didn’t think about that
man i just wish they would let us know about these things slightly earlier
also whatever happened to bob
i miss his right-after repeat emails
if you arent having a breakdown from one thing or another, are you really having the college experience
rip
Bob, gone too soon
I do have some sympathy for the timelines because its collaborations among many departments, and determining what is safe, as well as analyzing what has happened so far is constantly changing. The CDC changes its guidelines, and a superspreader event could happen at literally any time people gather.
i thought wasnt it all virtual
nope, some inperson
the typical boring stuff
this news has me greatly disappointed in my fellow classmates
never believe in people, never ends well
oh no
everytime i hear a person leave without washing their hands I cringe on the inside
the dorms are a mess, there've been 20+ ppl in the "closed" common rooms
I'm on that shit like wildfire
maybe theyre stupid sneaky
bad
our toilets always broke
idk man the toilets in Tyler flush like firehoses
that makes me sad
u shouldnt have to take a shower in the same room that someone is doodooshitting in
? other dorms aren't like that?
i will give em this tho, garbage is taken like twice a day
we only got paper towels tho less than a week ago
well we didnt even have a dispensor lol
Ppl be stealing the ones from the common room that are supposed to be used for disinfecting the table
nope
I’m mentally preparing myself that I won’t get to go lol
> @sprinkles2108 i’m late to the talk can you tell me why?
@Deleted User  it’s because sophomores and juniors have been prioritized above us so it depends on how many of them will wanna live on campus
I thought only my first semester would suck, didn't know it's a whole year
i mean like zach said the sophomores and juniors a. need it more b. got cucked a lot harder than us
still doesn't make my life less suck tho
fair
@2waynice bro it be awkward as hell when im taking a shit and someone comes in because im blowing the toilet up
@2waynice so I really can't find any courage to wipe it so I be doing wall squats over the damn toilet seat and people be poppijng in here all the time
@2waynice and the urinal flush don't work so you be pissing in other peoples' piss
@chandachan pics or it didn't happen
dont @ spam ppl
mmm
the bathrooms are not THAT  bad
i mean
they're not the best
but
there are flushes
there is toilet paper
THERE IS WARM WATER
there's shit on the floors 🥰
never watched that
so
i dunno
i just have it
The common denominator seems to be Zhanda.
Oh
aidan beck do ur fucking work
Did the wrong link
aidan and beck: oh shit have test
also aidan and beck: oo discord me clicky
i have test thursday 😎
sorry fancy man
our standards are lower than yours
Yeah not very many though
I did it because my internship got yanked out from under me and I wanted to now live in my yeehaw hometown
i feel it
kinda miserable to do it all in one month tho
oh frick that sounds hard
on a worse level
the worst binging
oh n O
And so it started on a tuesday, then exams for 4 mondays in a row, and then a final the day after the last exam
I got an A though
king shit
I was in hot fuckin water after the first one because it didn't go well at all and the margin for error was only 30 points over the whole course
I had I think 7 points of wiggle room over the last two exams but I pulled some maximum overdrive and got a 100 on the last exam and then 2 points above what I needed on the final
i need it
sarah
i forgot
r u
111 or 105
yall be will alright. just dont bomb more than 1 test and the final will come in clutch
Rona never goes away and no one can graduate from pe credit
They'd just waive it at that point tho
Flu is still around
“nah i couldn’t graduate college... couldn’t pass pe😔”
That shit happened 102 years ago
The spanish flu?
I guess so
influenza viruses are all pretty closely related, but unfortunately they can change interactions with receptors etc by just a few amino acids
bruh wtf he’s SMALL
You can't see it cuz it is small
just a shit ton
That's why having your nose hanging out of your mask is terrible
I wouldn't go to 8 though

How can the moon landings be in 1969 tho if the moon isn't real

How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real
Which isn't too sense
Wyoming doesn't exist

All my homies hate van der Waals equation
i totally forgot what that is 🙂
You only need to know this^^
Van der Waals didn’t even come 😂😂
good thing that didn't come
And kc said that math question of that most probably won’t come
We don’t lol
Boom exam
105 doesnt have quizzes??
I honestly wish we had quizzes though
I would be forced to study
I wish I brought my sudoku book 😔
math is hard
Just don’t do math then
No I don’t
I’m gay I don’t have to do anything
dylan how do you hate math if you're majoring in it
i don't hate it it's just hard
like i just took my first exam in political economy and it was stupid easy
i like the field but it's not necessarily like *challenging*
no they don't
Political economy wtf
lenin's theories = woke
lenin's solutions = broke
DYLAN DON'T CALL YOURSELF A NEO-CONSERVATIVE IF YOU DON'T OWN ONE OF THESE BAD BOYS
also 97.88% of ppl who use the term invisible hand don't actually know the context of how he used it
he never called division of labor a tragedy
Then who’s gonna tell my parents that they’re wrong smh
Couldnt be me
Fair, im a whole continent
Just full of dry bones and computer stuff
he doesn't disagree with it ignoramus he says that it leaves people ignorant and with singular skills
Never went to Disneyland before isn’t worth the hype
Nothing wrong w specialization
From what ive heard it really isnt
Dosney kinda sucks
Sad to hear it
leave me alone boi
It does leave people with mundane jobs, but he says that technological innovation COMPENSATES mundane jobs
Smith is dead anyway
stupid boy
Idk if he’s alive or not
The heavy is dead
i dont need to hear the pin factory allegory zhanda i already know it
To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving, the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day.
Are we sure ur a math major? U seem like an english major lol
Smith is dead anyway
zhanda u clearly haven't read wealth of nations so do so and then we can have a conversation
civilization advances by EXTENDING the number of important operations which we can perform without much thinking
Sometimes u just need a boom POW thwack
i'm not gonna have an argument on the wealth of nations with someone who hasn't actually read the wealth of nations
to say that acknowledging the plight of the worker and how specialization subjugates workers is not a "communist" reading, and you're idiotic for saying so, since smith literally makes the same point
but i'm done with this *conversation*
he's really just trying to piss me off at this point
Leave
I'm really not though like I was arguing just for it before
you can't say that when you haven't read the fucking book
shit i'm the one pulling pages out my ass
Rip

what kind of hot sauce tho
omg yesss
Does the sleep hit you hard?

Idk do I want to go crazy spice or flavor spice
ur body sends all power to stomach to digest

I heard a HORSE outside my window
and yet
Oh snap
THERE WAS A FUCKING HORSE
Aw
What a school
Oh fair
hand goes *poof*
Don’t need hand anyway
At my high school's homecoming they had horses bring in the homecoming court and when the band started our fanfare to announce them one of the horses got spooked and FUCKING DIED OF A HEART ATTACK ON THE TRACK
oh fuck

two, what the absolute fuck
I too got spooked so hard had heart attacks
Omg
I can now do my psychology homework lol

I need 1 too
She's not the president anymore
They've already found the next president tho
I don't have any idea who it is
or zach, just get some premium air guitars from howdy's guitars
Chris Butler can drive the deficit up to 40 million and I would still want him
I feel like Chris Butler is legitimately too smart to be president
zach right tho, i've worked with execs b4
Working behind the scenes is the most fun
you want to be advisor, not pres
Either Ultralight Beam, Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 2 or Powe

Sorry to this song, but I have never heard her
nov 23 seems rightish

Babie is awake Bc someone is at door rip

brussells i can see hate
I don’t like raw tomatoes
nothing grows in chicago
Oh snap???
I need to finish my slices 😔
Ron you need to mail me some Giordano's

There's a Giordano's like an hour away but I don't trust Ohio Giordano's
I don’t know how many c’s that was

Oh man

Wish I was less lazy and used communal oven
Then I need a tray
Holy shit
holy shit
you cant peel babi
No the babie wanted cheese sticks, and idk where they r
Bc you were at the hospital, and then taplin and then chicago and then taplin and then like Norway and then idk
My crisis was caused by how cold my dorm was, so I need Refuge
we need to put a gps tracker that just updates ur status, either at hospital, at dorm at fam
I never went back to Chicago lol
I told my dad to take me back for my bday he said no rip
6h car
dont speed in ohio
Yea fuck Indiana
indiana is short
oh 💀
why not the plane
and take like 30-60min due to traffic
Nah but still if you're driving that far without intermittent stops, there's always a chance of accident
i dont know how u made it 4.5, we sped ours down to like 5.25
Zach, it feels like we shop at the same walmart
And, despite all of that, we still end up on People of Walmart
smh my head
Not Chicago tho
lon me these tenders got me sleepy
ron, dont you know the entirety of illinois is chicago
I used to live in bowling green which is northwest ohio and man it was cold
Don't make me bring back beanie
oh yeah like if you less than an hour from chicago you live in chicago. i don’t make the rules
we cant handle that much power
@chandachan Like 25% of my graduating class goes to BGSU
theres nothing else
What’s defined as Chicagoland goes farther than an hour I think
we cant talk about dirty rivers over here lol
Hey ours isn't infested with carp yet
And also it hasn't caught on fire in 50 years
yet
Have you seen the updated ones tho
Isn’t that the only one
isn't there
"don't slow down in east cleveland or you'll die"
never heard of youngtown
Kent state is more for Historical purposes i feel like
if you scroll up in #memes😂 zhanda, i broke down every ohio city
Ursuline but that died
College of Wooster
Oh Mt Union aka Republican State
dr driscoll went there
No she's too awesome to have gone there
Holy shit she did go there
Because it's really expensive, and mostly an athletics school full of guys who are enlightened centrists who want to be lawyers
She made 50 masks for people stuck on campus when it all went down that didn't have one
She offered to go grocery shopping for kids who didn't have cars
damn nice
kinda makes me wish I took physics with her this semester
instead of only having her for lab last year
Oh also the summer before my sophomore year, she learned OChem so that she could identify and help her premed kdis
trust me, polish accents aint captivating
i am sad
i want brownie in mug
im playing these 8 tenders got me feeling some other way
Oh
Wow you need an angioplasty jesus
delivery is still a thing at least
gh doesnt give me any options
i remember that I got Wingstop on the day before spring break last year
cuz :simp: get nitro
frick its almost 1am, i was supposed to do the hw due today
Oh snap it is 1am
Babie is still awake lol
while i go do the sleep❤️
since when did you have nitro
I dont have nitro
since when has peepo been global
who the fuck
discord broke from time to time
dying from lack of fruit snacc
Oh I could’ve given u some
but damn are they good
something about old white ppl dying from flavor
ive never been to rite aid
which just aint the same
how does that work sarah lmao
idk how much i’ll look for u next time
Heard it thru
unfortantly i cant pass as a nurse, i dont look like a 🐴
i thought hec was far away!!
not far away
Don’t need to b nurse or student
never walking again that’s it
There’s a stop on Ford and juniper
smh my head
i have to log in, rip
dont get it confused for the widely and well known masterlock
these locks are designed to fool the consumer into buying a worse lock than masterlock themselves provide
watch as I open this lock with nothing but a soda can
ping bad
Hold on I just realized, does this mean u guys were actually walking everywhere, and not taking shuttle?
i havent been
little italy isnt anything new to me
I walk to fast for rona to catch me 😎 didnt even notice if ppl had masks on when I went to little Italy
when i drive through there they dont
nahh not getting a sleeve yet
*yet*
bad news bears
yeahhh ik but i don’t really leave my apartment lmao
Well no rona isn’t blood thing
it just needs to get inside u
Sometimes I want tats then i Remember
No that I want to b nurse
but aren't they spacious?
Just barely tho
we did some maths
Oh I can’t do roomates
ron clearly doesnt settle for anything less than a mansion smh my head
oh loll
Yea but I want visible ones
u wish
fair enough
Also I do single room out of necessity not want
cuz kids are dum
The only viable tat I want is of cartoon characters anyway so it would b kid friendly
aslong as you slave away to ur work
wtf
isnt the worst tattoo places the soft bits
No the hard bits
What do you want to get tattooed
my tattoos haven’t hurt tbh only a bit when the one on my back got close to my spine
dont want to break that
I want shoulder and thigh and forearm
you pinch someone there
Thigh won’t hurt much it’s all squish
ribs + spine + ankles hurt the most
ron you finna be tatted yp with thse bad boys
Close to heart
They’d probably kill me then cry abt how they’ll bury me with tarnished skin
That’s still near heart?
my parents don’t know about the one i’m getting soon lmao
I want to be cremated and then shot out of a Hasbro EleFun
arent we such the cheerful lot
dont drink the kool aid tho
I kind of want this
i don’t think i would ever get a colored tattoo
If I got my cartoon characters I would see if I could color them, but going thru work to find someone to color on my skin is smth im not willing to go thru
I like that it’s just an uprooted tree but still upright
I also want an epic Organic or Biochem Compound
If you gain weight or lose weight when you have a tattoo will it be disproportionate to your body?
cuz their body aint done growing
Well it doesn’t matter
so it looks bad later one
my body is slowly dying
So it doesn’t matter
Probs won’t come to cle for tats
My tattoos are just lines so I really could go anywhere for them
Get liver failure for a whole body tattoo
Lines wouldn’t be straight tho
Already have liver failure in my cards tho
you won't as dramatic of an effect as white people tho
Eyes already p rough tho F
Oh u mean the skin effects
I wish star wars was real
I would b person who complains abt how my apartment keeps getting trashed by heroes with no compensation
the guys who have to clean up after the heros
become gwenpool, aware of ur existence so they cant kill you off
I can’t think abt living in a world of heroes Bc I have acab agenda and it would just translate over
hope you dont get caught in the middle of civil war then
cuz u ded
Would b dead in any civil war anyway
we'd end up henchmen probs
they dont survive long
Man i'm missing dylan so badly because he's always providing interesting comments and insights
Getting mad abt how humans are being harmed by collateral damage
Would have a blast learning about how non humans worked tho
detroit gone human
type shit
Hate the idea of living that long
i'd want a sonic tho
So basically death
mmmm don’t want the memories tho
Exactly why I’d just prefer to die
No fun in regen if the homies can’t come with
but i dont even need the extra lives
i just need a tardis
I’d have to cut it up into precisely even pieces tho and that’s too much work
Like of anyone lived just a second longer than everyone else they would die so sad
they drank the koolaid at the wrong time
its cuz its koolaid
oh, isnt that the one they sabotaged the eleectric cars from cuz they were paid to show that gas was better still
not surprising, since money wants to keep their money
not a car guy, so cant help ya there
never is the correct answer
I don't even need words to tease your state
Rednecks really
@mootdoot you got some mirlax these tenders wont leave my stomach

I never wanted 8 am classes
> And cwru put me into an 8 am sages class
@sprinkles2108  just wake up early smh
no waking up early
> @sprinkles2108  just wake up early smh
@raunakwastaken  don’t tell me how to wake up early. My hs started at 7:20 am every morning
Just dont wake up at all
So 8 am ain’t bad for me
> Just dont wake up at all
@howdy_.  UHM DARK???
Dunno what u talking aboot
> @raunakwastaken  don’t tell me how to wake up early. My hs started at 7:20 am every morning
@sprinkles2108  ahh that’s early
But they don’t listen
Oh
And damn did it feel good
> And damn did it feel good
@raunakwastaken  I’ve never abused my power because I never had any😎
why do i feel that im gonna fail this test hardly?
mmm

> @sprinkles2108  nothing happened. Let’s move on
@raunakwastaken tell her
BRUH I'M SO GONNA FAIL THIS TEST
the gif?
i dunno
> @raunakwastaken tell her
@kaori_flute  nothing happened
Wasn’t really a roast
Yeah it wasn’t that much of a roast
Nope
Don’t beat yourself down like that
It wasn’t drew
He was like “no I won’t answer that”
Cause he wants to be able to change it over the weekend
So yea. Wasn’t a roast. He’s a chill guy
Oh gotcha
Never
At least with how the timings work
I was playing overwatch with friends and I didn't want to say anything and scare them off
during the fire alarm i didnt realize it was going on till the ppl i was chiliing w/ were like, you should probably get moving
Ah, unfortunately I cannot, because I take my job responsibly
It has to be closed and anonymous before I can talk
OH
There are enough times that I'm good at managing aggressive, drunk, bleeding, sick, injured, blacked out, freshman
I was Tyler House last year, Village Houses 1&2, and Triangle 2 over the summer, and then I'm back in Tyler
College kids are annoying af
seriously tho
waking up in the am bc someone is locked out:vibe:
> waking up in the am bc someone is locked out:vibe:
@sar.hh  bruhhhh
God damn it I only took textbook notes which have come in clutch for the last concept checks
do u want me to share my chem study guide w u pri
it’s a work in progress
> do u want me to share my chem study guide w u pri
@sar.hh  that would be great🥺🥺
some of those questions are hard ngl
all bc ppl didn’t wanna wear masks to a pence rally
and now they don’t wanna stay home
I have one more attempt left in bio kms
Cuyahoga county has some of the strictest masking laws and also is the second most populous county in Ohio but yet we are still level 2
I DIDNT GET THE CHANCE TO FIGURE OUT A QUESTION
Time to die
I hate myself sndjusjdhdus
Yeah Ohio is doing shit rn
Literally governor Dewine was like guys wtf we ain’t doing well
But people don’t wanna ✨listen✨
Oh
But I guess good isn’t the word for it
Well yeah when we have a president who said "The doctors have never seen a body kill the coronavirus like mine. They tested my DNA and I don't have DNA. I have USA."
Apparently Trump feels better than he did 20 years ago
Yeah I also feel 20 years younger after sclerosis of my lungs, collapse of my alveoli, and when I struggle to spew hate on Fox news like a 7th grader who can't have an extra YooHoo from the vending machine
but i don't know what a yoohoo is
People are just tired of it
I shouldn't have to enforce social distancing and masks. Just too damn selfish
However pure collectivism is also a bad deal for this pandemic, because you develop stigma quickly around health issues and you can quickly become a pariah
Well I mean it shouldn’t be pure collectivism but enough to combat the virus like other countries have
In individualism you're going to (unfortunately) find other people who won't do things like self-reports, quarantines, isolations, wear their masks
Apparently rights>health
Yeah it needs to be like 75-80% collectivism
Can’t have rights if you’re dead though🤔
oh-
sorry
I’m so fcking dumb in that class
I got referred by my boss because the cops were on scene and they wanted me because I could talk to the student
Damn
It turned out alright but I'm just exhausted
I will help whoever needs it lol
Or if anybody ever wants to talk about fish
I'm so tired
Thank you for the positivity Adam, It's very nice. Unfortunately due to covid I've lost the part I found most rewarding which was just hanging out and talking, watching sports, learning about my boys
So now I have to be the bad guy or mr emergency all the time
No, that's juniper RA on call unfortunately. Last year for spring break I was Juniper, Mistletoe, and Cedar
Hmm... so I can’t throw a surprise get to know us party...
Well I don't drink at all now. I haven't had anything since I was 15 and I had champagne at a wedding
Not really but we vibin
You got it just keep grinding we've only got half a semester left
and u can't forget it outside
cuz u also have to scan your way inside
Please do not that shit be load as fuck
who is even outside at 5am
I finna die
Tjem naps be hitting differently during the school year
OMG
Aight time to leave the country
Raunak: *tries to leave the country*

Modi: no❤️
Aren’t there travel restrictions in India still?
> Aren’t there travel restrictions in India still?
@sprinkles2108  I don’t think so
Isn't Modi controversial
> Isn't Modi controversial
@toomanyzs lol no
> Isn’t Modi controversial
@toomanyzs  I’m gonna sound like a trump supporter but Modi has helped India a lot ever since he was elected
Even my dad was shooketh when he went there last year
Doesn’t mean they have similar ideologies
Thing is Modi is the type to kiss up to any American leader he just wants to be friends with the US
All I knew back in 2014 when the elections were going on is that Rahul Gandhi sucks ass
I’m scared
And boom it’ll die
Idk why I’m so scared to every animal
> Venomous meaning poisonous
@sprinkles2108 oh really I didn’t know that
FUCK
Omg no
I CANT EVEN SCROLL UP
Oh
Ok don’t spam like that
Annoying
I don’t like any animals
Raunak I don’t know why but I’m getting the vibe that you’re short
Are you short ?
I’m just wondering
Idk e
Idk whether I’m shört
> 5’ 9 is average for a boy imo
@sprinkles2108  why do you have to hurt me
Huh
No
I do be celebrating homecoming alone
> @sprinkles2108  why do you have to hurt me
@raunakwastaken  UhM I think it’s natural selection that hurt you
Yeah, you can't get the fruit from as high of trees so your alleles will die out
Just like Lamarck's short necked giraffes
> @raunakwastaken  UhM I think it’s natural selection that hurt you
@sprinkles2108  okay y’all are just bully
Watch me still fail
Didn’t know i had great instincts
And I’m still growing!!!
I grew til this summer
Oh so you're short and a fetus
> Didn’t know i had great instincts
@sprinkles2108  you don’t ❤️
> @sprinkles2108  you don’t ❤️
@raunakwastaken  you know I do
Sorry I couldn't hear you from being able to vote and be drafted into the military and go to jail and buy cigars
Damn
I turn 19 in 5 months
Clearly I wasn’t lying about my instincts on your height
> Clearly I wasn’t lying about my instincts on your height
@sprinkles2108  shut❤️
From very short to short?
Are you though? :thonk:
close enough
Bruh I told y’all I don’t like animals and y’all are like “ohh you short” like bruh where’s the correlation
I’ve been getting that vibe from you for a long time
Sad
Idk you have tall girl energy
Damn
Couldn’t be me
There seems to be an overlap with that and discord users
I went there
Aren’t
Yeah I don't have a girlfriend rn
> @sprinkles2108 it seems like discord doesn’t allow people to date huh
@raunakwastaken  hmmmm
I guess so
Omg
5'7 is my guess
We’re just tryna guess man
Bruh 5’5 is super short
And i ain’t that short
Oh
> And i ain’t that short
 ^^
IM DYING
Cant
Too bad I'm in the US of A
Don’t you know what that means
interpol means shit in the US
OMG
And we don't drive tuk tuks
Its either that, czechia or Belgium
I dead
Omg
> Lemme call an ambulance for free
@raunakwastaken  damn I’m roasted
I have many roasts but I do not want to make enemies
Obviously I will never cross a line
I don’t know to be honest
I should’ve taken the semester off smfh
Just say that 7 more times while being upset and then you're done with college
> There was some big drama my freshman year because there was a rift between some northern indians and southern indians after some mocking about skin tone went on
@toomanyzs  oh boyyyyy wtf they need to grow up
It was really bad
Said some bad stuff about another one of the RA's sisters
Holy shit
Man *fuck* colorism
It’s a shame that cwru still had that issue
Hmmm never heard of him
I wish there was more of his material
Poor guy
I have to preface that jenin is the only flautist I know on-campus zach so I didn't trick you 🤡
> I have to preface that jenin is the only flautist I know on-campus zach so I didn't trick you 🤡

@chandachan  OPE🤭
@kaori_flute atleast you aren’t “the guy who went to an all boys school”
Someone recognized me as that
I can relate tho
I went to an all girls school
They’re like “omg you know everything that’s going on in class and you respond so quick and help everyone” meanwhile I’m out here failing bio
> I went to an all girls school
@kaori_flute  yikes
I went to a public co-ed school😎
> I went to an all girls school
@kaori_flute  atleast people don’t associate you with that
I went to coed rural farm school
People drove tractors and lawnmowers occasionally to school
I had Mitchell's last night
But I want something sweet yet again
Zach weren't you the ra on-call last night
but I want to save the rest
terrible
oh yikes
Why would someone get locked out at 5am
I try to burn my anger into their brains with my gaze when they don't have their masks on
You can open your room with you phone right?
But still

BUT YOU STILL NEED IT DOOR TO DOOR
i still wear in bathroom
If you're not in your room you need it

Haven’t started 😔

Remember when there was a time this year where we thought he was dead?
2020 really lasted a whole decade

> Remember when there was a time this year where we thought he was dead?
@sprinkles2108  almost forgot that it happened this year

Nope
Guess

Sorry
Last try

but i don’t think heat on yet
For when u need to summon the howdster :DryBones:
I don’t see them
fair
I just wanna be on campus in the spring🥺 but that likely won’t happen
Kinda sucks
Because freshmen who chose not to come this fall are prioritized last for housing in the spring
So it’s likely that they won’t have housing available for us
oh noooo
hope for the best
prepare for the worst
UGH
NEED

I want friends in college
IF U CAN'T COME PRI
WE CAN VC AS MUCH AS U WANT

I found out on Friday that my Pchem Midterm was Monday, not Wednesday like I had thought for several weeks
Oh man I just wrote H3PO$ instead of H3PO4 and if I became a rapper that would be my rap name
that’s sick
Become a rapper if medicine doesn’t work out
> Or maybe I could make educational chemistry raps
@toomanyzs  please drop a mixtape for the Chem 105 exam 2 because we’re dying out here
Time to cry
-8ball will Zach get into a prestigious med school

Damn
-8ball really?
-8ball is someone trashtalking me rn
Oh damn
Priyanka shouldn't you be studying for chem

Monday Thursday is a much better exam schedule than Monday Tuesday or Tuesday Wednesday
> Priyanka shouldn't you be studying for chem

What exam is this?
since it open note?
I could never
if u guys want
~~we can all do the test together~~
> if u guys want
> ~~we can all do the test together~~
@kaori_flute  uhh
Don’t cheat
Please don’t cheat
ugh scotus stuff started today
but if y'all want to review review sheets
needs help
Chem is on Wednesday and I still haven’t thoroughly reviewed
Which I will fail anyway
> what ‘s that?
@kaori_flute  as a freshman you can drop any semester class anytime during the semester and it won’t show up on your transcript. Though I think once you take the final you can’t drop the class/it will show up on your transcript
u get 2 of them tho me thinks
~~the voice inside~~
Jenin you still need to have 13 credits after you drop
Which you won’t have if you drop CS
i can't math
it's designed so u can't get help
he said he does not want to look at all our faces
where do we find said ta sessions
Why am I still in bed
don't we have groups today?
i still dont see where ur finding these things
Howdy we legit talked about it 2 weeks back
Anyway...I didn’t join the 10:35am one
> Hac?
@raunakwastaken i can't do simple java
and u say hac?
currently working on the review sheet tho
Bruh imma be hella sleepy by 1am
if(sleepy())
{
    dont();
}
nope
5head
we should really be studying instead of talking about emotes
fair
aren’t ur tests open note
but open note doesnt mean we can interact with the internet/other people
this is an indication that won't know how to declare a variable
short
wrong type o bite
lol connamacher wont ask basic definations
unfortunately
we need to write *code*
bruh
leutner fries is not good anymore
no need to use api tho
he wants us to know how to use api
don't go lookin'
cuz
he'll give us the ones we need
we need to know Object, String, and StringBuilder APIs
on your exams
we won't need it today
ahhhh discord sound
miss this
it has occured to me there was a textbook for this class
its not that bad
jenin why are you alone in vc?
dunno
this gif hurts
Friendly reminder to get pumped before your exams! If you go in nervous you're going to be slow
howdy when is your weekly cs class?
It is open book, open note, because she's like lol this shit be hard tho
so monday?
Took notes on wrong chapter
Wondering if I should just perish
I’m like, asking the ghosts of my room for the answers on this iclicker because I sure as hell don’t know this shit
I’ve been taking notes for bio
Haven’t even touched chem yet
And my chem exam is on Wednesday
we all gonna fail chem together
The reason I’m more worried about bio is because Bader doesn’t drop a topical exam like Meyer does
So even if I bombed this next chem exam I couldddddd save myself
Nope
So I’m just tryna study
GONNA FAIL
FAIL
cause if it's literal i have no FUCKING CLUE
rip me
I didnt get to finish anything in that mess
bro i didn't even know
last two questions were straight dookie
i didnt get there
I started typing gibberish for the last 2
i think connamacher is aware enough that even though people will definitely get 100%s
damn, you got all the way to 6
no time to cry about that
Some people in this class already know wtf going on and they could probably program a human being such that it actually prints a living human in perfect health
now i gotta study for chem
and math
why cant we adopt the european system where tests are given for each class in stages
time to do acct hw, acct project, study for acct test, java project, sages bibliography, and math hw
bye
oh frick, i have a sages essay due
you saw how fucking useless i was man
this test is going to fuck my high B that I was already struggling to get in the frist place
damn
Every time I think I know wtf going on in this class...
I actually dont
i tried
i need a curve of like 50points
I think i need 20 for a c
if this mf wanted the test to be submitted at 305, why DID HE MAKE IT SO THAT IT ENDED AT 310
Bruh 4 doesn’t make sense
im already fucked in math
6 wasn’t that bad
but by the time i realized what he wanted
it was too late
Just found out that Connamacher doesn’t curve
Finals ig?
Oh hell nah
kill me now
say goodbye to getting a passing grade
Wish I went to college in the past
So science wasn’t as advanced
And math was super ez
Not until they lied about the anonymous survey and I end up with a 12% in the lab
I pray this information doesn’t leave my head
Oh
no I'm saying that's what will happen
-8ball will the chem department fix the bullshit
-8ball Really
-8ball will they fix the grading
-8ball will I pass math midterm?
-8ball will I do well on the bio exam?
RIP
FUCK YOU 8Ball
-8ball will I do good on the chem exam
> FUCK YOU 8Ball
@sprinkles2108  :banhammer: :banhammer:
-8ball really?
OMG ZHANDA
I’m about to sleep
-8ball i shall fail everything
-8ball i shall fail everything
-8ball i shall fail everything
-8ball i shall fail everything
-8ball i shall fail everything
i realized math is tomorrow, no wednesday
so im learning how math works
thats too much complicated math
and didnt include it in patch notes
red eyes be a vibe tho
what other updates have happened
> https://tenor.com/view/eyes-creepy-halloween-make-up-gif-13260717
omg just found this
i found one that was much worse
i’m in this vc with a bunch of people and i don’t think i should be here 😆
then... leave...?
i’m bored
Y’all it’s gonna be so cold this Friday
except -40
i like it when its cold outside and im in my bed snuggled up with my blanket
@toomanyzs bruh I tried that for my chem lab and it literally took me 2 hours to make a single lab setup
I'm doing carbonation rearrangements of phenylmethelium to tropylium with intermediates and it's terrible
Pain
except for denial
And it’s just before math midterm
someone pls tell me the last mc wasn't autograded
Ready for math test?
This is the worst day of my life
Got another midterm in half an hr 😔
> This is the worst day of my life
@spartan010  This is the worst day of my life *yet*
This is the worst *week* of my life
I have the big sad
i understand there’s only one week in the middle of semester but like cmon man
cuz america makes no sense
aka, the classes are staggered so you dont have everything due at once
i don’t even need weeks like even a day break between them would b nice smh
and even tho there are midterms, projects and essays are still due the same day'
like wow, you really want us to fail here dontcha
Technically I don’t think I have midterms
All of my classes have had a quiz or test every 2 weeks, so this doesn’t feel new
> All of my classes have had a quiz or test every 2 weeks, so this doesn’t feel new
@mootdoot  yeah same for me bio, math, and chem exams aren’t cumulative so technically they’re not midterms
But I guess people call them that so oh whale
> But I guess people call them that so oh whale
@sprinkles2108  w h a l e 🐳 🐋
You didn’t even edit that
> You didn’t even edit that
@raunakwastaken  that’s because I intentionally spelled it that way
whale I guess I didn’t get it
I wish snapchat had dark mode
You should leave Snapchat
But honestly I’m sick of social media in general
At one point this year I was addicted to Reddit but not anymore
Really weird shit gets said when you’re anonymous
Fax though
HEY YALL ~~since many of you cared enough to go register to vote~~ ALSO PLEASE ANSWER THE CENSUS!!!! ***THE CENSUS INCLUDES NON-CITIZENS!*** ANYONE RESIDING IN THE US IS COUNTED! https://my2020census.gov/
(and the trump administration is trying to shut it down early so please please please answer it asap)
Dang, i was hoping it wasnt
Also a heavy majority of us can’t do census, we’ll be counted in with our parents most likely
Our dorms don’t count as a household
No but since there's mostly freshman here, they would have been in their house as of april 1st, 2020
Everything’s based on where we live/would’ve been living April 1st tho, that would just be our homes for freshmen at least
> HEY YALL ~~since many of you cared enough to go register to vote~~ ALSO PLEASE ANSWER THE CENSUS!!!! ***THE CENSUS INCLUDES NON-CITIZENS!*** ANYONE RESIDING IN THE US IS COUNTED! https://my2020census.gov/

and check if your parents have already filled it out for your household forgot to mention this
oh yeah the Raging Avocado truck is not moving for awhile cause of technical issues they're in front of the Den the whole day now
(also i work there and uh... dont order the smoothies)
I was offered a job as a cook at Jolly my freshman year and apparently back then It was rough
Yea that’s my thing, my parents already did it for me so I wouldn’t wanna get double counted
I can’t believe I fell asleep and missed tacos wth
rip tacos
I STG BEING A CO-HOST FEELS SO EMPOWERING
and you probably make mad $$$ from it so
I want someone to do a case review of my eyes 💔
> I want someone to do a case review of my eyes 💔
@mootdoot  I want Dr. Chu to conduct my eye exams so fck it I’m moving to New Jersey
dont
nj bad
I would never betray this state❤️
I only bleed scarlet and gray even though I don’t go to OSU❤️
I don't think anyone deserves to be banished to NJ
delaware doesnt exist
I knew a guy who got stuck in NJ due to covid
poor guy
I think he's still there
He is a rich Vietnamese Frenchman who lives in Switzerland with his monacan gf though
so I don't pity him that much
I agree it's a terrible place
you really cant
isn't toronto in like
supposed to b roomate lol
seems like its gonna happen
*though
oh yeah that sounds wrong ope
now im gonna end up in #quotes ...
Fuck
Fuck
FUCK
Well shit
My timing is always wrong huh
still hasnt dropped below the first peak
5head
don't take the rta unless necessary
don't go to west side market
don't go somewhere far away for a hair cut
p weak bubble, for work i have to travel in and around
Where do you work
oh ik
Oh
let's go watch an tOSU game and wear no masks so we can get covid and go to the hotel and get sick leave
They happen
or chipoltle during peak hours
they aren't that secret tho
so today I broke my own rule about not going there, and visited at 11am with double mask filters and where there were only five people in the store
I couldn't believe my eyes
like WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT ACCOMPLISH
smh my head
you can understand why i hate the chipoltle here...
but u see adam, if you never go out and eat, you never go into chipotle
yes and no, but it's not as bad as the one due two weeks ago
don't judge priyanka, we are on the same wavelength
i havent gotten access to the roof room yet
i know its behind the door tho
It'll work, trust me, I'm in physics 121
the thing w/ the model rockets engines tho
since solid fuel
we'd need to have a man on the inside of the rocket club here
who wants to volenteer
Howdy go study for your chem exam
bye howdy
actually don't do that
i've given up on studying, its all over
**you will never leave this place, you will always be the IT guy**
Forgot what I was gonna say :naenae:
he wrote all this crazy code and shit for it, but he couldn't use it in competition
like guided missle shit
what really should be illegal are these commit messages
I just hope that I don’t run out of time
But hey if god doesn’t want it to happen it won’t no matter what😌
-8ball are you sure I won’t do better on this next bio exam?
Howdy 8ball says it doesn’t have anger issues
it doesnt
Hate it here
its too early for that sentence to make sense to me
Anyone need an extra periodic table my printer printed more than I told it to
OMG
i hate school
> Send it to Kolkata
@raunakwastaken  how specific as if Kolkata isn’t a highly populous place in india
But I’m sorry to hear that :(
my prof said that she loves the online format because she can give us more work. that we dont have to spend class time on tests so she gave us a fucking 2.5h online test that is to be taken outside of class
> @raunakwastaken  how specific as if Kolkata isn’t a highly populous place in india
@sprinkles2108  ikr
> my prof said that she loves the online format because she can give us more work. that we dont have to spend class time on tests so she gave us a fucking 2.5h online test that is to be taken outside of class
@mag3is  okkkk that’s messed up fr
Just because we’re at home doesn’t mean our extra time should be used to further burn ourselves out smh
im already burnt out
Oh whale
Who’s ready to fail?
Bad
fuck
I don’t think there was even a single math question
Like wtf
kill meeeee
u guys didn’t do any math at all?
I practiced math problems so much
i hate online tests i bet he made it all conceptual since it’s hard to type in math
Concepts I didn’t even know existed

that sucks so hard
it’s all pain
endless pain and suffering!!

"midterms are temporary, but series are forever" - my math prof

my current math class on the other hand...
math 321 was a mistake
Which math is that?
math was  a mistake
we have a project due on friday :orange:

i yet have to look at the project
i also dunno how to code
so will try and figure out how to even write the code
> couldnt be me
@howdy_.  out midterms are over
@raunakwastaken thats where ur wrong kiddo
> thats where ur wrong kiddo
@howdy_.  WDYM?
Now I’m doing class outside
pls dont be one of those ppl who's like sitting in the quad in ur zoom class with the birds chirping
All I’m gonna say is that I’m thankful that Drew drops your lowest topical exam
It goes from my elbows to my knuckles wtf
u must have a mad short arm
that doesnt even look appetizing for some reason
My laptop is like 13” so this is terrifyingly long
I don’t know where to store it
I can’t eat all of this
zhanda u dont know shit abt h town
Cause I'm coming home again
i deadass have not been entertaining eminem's output since i was like in middle school but what i've sampled
i wish u kids liked half decent hip hop :/
its rlly so sad to me the quality of the rap game these days
If you want horror
u guys dont even know horrorcore smh
I didn’t wanna say Keef tho 😔
I wanted to b Different✨
Literally could not go anywhere in elementary or middle school without his shit playing
ima need u to stop with all that
I didn't even know people could rap outside Chicago like in detroit
math is dumb
literally dirty south is the reason why hip hop sucks so much ass today
Keep that shit in the city
Oh
Just abt as long as mine tho
Fuck this biscotti I deserve better
I couldn’t not make that statement
sorry
Ron wtf
I think I’m almost don’t with this biscotti
He keeps cutting it off and I keep growing it back
Ron was supposed to be mine and Zhandas side chick
ron would die before he pledged allegiance to either of u
Damn what a hard sell
Oh there
Dylan go away
step away from the ron
I won’t 😤
I’m exhausted
And this lab bout to last an hour
Leave the meeting and blame the internet
fuck
fuck
fuck
FUCK
now i want chicken nuggets
baby yoda doesnt know chicken nug
I’m so sleepy😭
do you wanna study bio later? :cri:
the emoji on laptop...
I want nap
I want bio knowledge
Though so far I haven’t been a smol brain in this si session yet
I need my gogosqueeze I can’t survive without ittt
want
need. iphone charger
I forgot to charge my phone while I was sleeping
Everyday is a struggle really :naenae:
GIVR THE PHONE TO YOUR MOM
OH MYSEERIPUS
Aw
U want one?
I’m rationing but if u want one
Except I’ve been in a 16 inch biscotti induced haze
All in a days work 😌
isnt thursday ur freeday
Bc stupid work for stupid money for stupid college
I no longer have free Thursdays :pepecry:
rip
I did take 10 snickers that were left on the table
No I think it was just for the ppl who worked in that office
I need to work out my arms tho
I am very upset that I must do exercise to do shooting practice
i'm working during those hours, so i just told em, ya no
I just don’t wanna go
cuz laziness and exercise dont mix
I want to do arrow stuff but not exercise
I’d b athlete if I wanted to do that stuff
didnt they say something about the 17th
Oh shit that’s this Saturday
Not worth going outside in cold for exercise just to shoot arrow for like an hour
But then don’t need atm strength
Not enough for me to want to go outside except for essentials
learning how to kill zambies silently is essential wdym
I’ll just bash head in with laptop
what if laptop goes snap tho
double the laptop, double the power
why the moo does leutner close this early?
probably its about an hour or so rn
it says pickup in 10 mins :critty:
still need to have the energy to get up
that took forever
It took so long mostly bc I stopped and talked here before finishing lol
that seems short tbh
doesnt it ussually take you like 1/2 a day or something
If I move too much in my sleep, it won’t look nice
then u cant move
I would still be moving my head tho
My head would need to b strapped down lol
Wish that were me
just dont have hair
The look on that persons face tho
thats the look of dying inside
couldnt be me with all these midterms and prjects
i want dem monies
Ngl I hate online learning
Imma cry
"If you can read this, then why aren't you standing behind the sneeze guard? -Ashes"
but isnt it well
i hate math !
i’m tired of numbers
I hate bio !
Oh wait my math exam is tomorrow
I actually understood shit at the si session today but again it wasn’t in detail
For once I know shit
But I’m so scared he’ll test us on such a small detail that I forgot to study
I have to redo my chem lab report because even though I saved it 1936482827373 times it got deleted
Never had an issue with saving once I connected my onedrive, until that stupid outage
i’m tired of understanding math
i wish to be ignorant instead man
Math will be No More
> Just connect ur one drive?
@mootdoot  I didn’t download/get access to cwru’s Office 365 yet because the private vpn won’t let me log in so I can’t even download it from their software website until I figure out how to get the vpn to work
Since I’d be getting Office 365 from a location that’s not on campus
I’ve been using my mom’s laptop
Oooo yea yea ur off campus rip
Yeah rip
Oh whale
I mean ur not missing out on much
Except for semi regular mitchell runs
So then I can’t focus
And then I end up procrastinating
Even if I didn’t major nursing I still would’ve come on campus just to get Away
I shouldn’t have listened to my parents’ suggestion at the time lmao
Except meg, lov u meg
I told my parents I’m getting tf outta here
Oh gotcha
Thing is freshmen who chose to stay remote are prioritized last
So I don’t know if they’ll have room for us
And being smart enough to balance your school and social life
OH
I haven’t played a game in sooo long
i am never speaking to you again
rules dont apply to me beta
also wrong channel bich
lmao you can't ban the president
not anymore bozo
ive never been kicked or banned
idk how u figure
Fuck Kanye
i think that shit is hilarious for the record
I think that on Halloween I am going put my noise cancelling headphones on and soundproof my room because Halloween is a Saturday, and last year it was a wednesday, and I wrote 7 IRs in one night alone
and dont you have to do ur rounds or something
No, we don't anymore because of Covid. But I walk my building anyway because the 2nd floor was way too rowdy when they thought they were going to be more free from rules as a reslt
Why aren’t out math score out?
I woke up early
cuz chris hasnt graded them yet
rip, so we cant see how much cbt is screwing w/ ppl smh
For once I’m hella sleepy but I must study bio
Math I can cram in an hour or so
Pri go to sleep
decided thats about how much studying i can do
Though I will wake up early to review math
and promply died
You still have 2 midterms left right
Math and bio
until it isnt
Math has been fine for me though
Bruh I want my math score
I couldn’t sleep
Imma sleep and wake up at 4:30 to study I guess
*though
Thing is I’m hella sleepy from the night before
rip
I went to bed at 4 am last night
I do be tired
I turned in a lab at 5:09 am
I didn’t have my coffee late enough to stay awake rn
Had it too early
> the benefits of online
@howdy_.  I’ve been sleeping in bed for my last couple sages classes
I do not feel pride
I feel only pain
> I feel only pain
@toomanyzs  no pain no gain
I turned in a FIRE fucking lab report tho
But seriously seeing all of y’all don’t get enough sleep is really weird
Like i just woke up from a 7:30 hour sleep
I'm taking 19 credit hours and I live in my job what do you want from ne
> I turned in a FIRE fucking lab report tho
@toomanyzs  my chem lab report got wiped out today so I have to restart it. Thankfully I had only written the procedure and made data tables
I’m taking 18 hours. Only 6 of them are kicking my ass
Today I woke up at 10
Which isn’t that bad
I heard you don't even have to do the labs
We got graded on the accuracy of our lab work
Pardon me, but I find that bullshit
Except we actually do it virtually
I was so slow in my chem exam today fml
Because drew drops your lowest topical exam
then dropping 1 wont help much
He only drops it if your finals are more than that
Too late zach
drew set us up to fail and it acting on the plan
> I heard the final is rough
@toomanyzs  fuck
I didn't understand that ban
No cap out of the 18 hours all 18 are kixking my ass lmaoooo
No it was a fake ban
I never reccomend my freshman take more than 16 or 17
Because some classes are so much more work than others of the same credit load
There are even still soft 19s and hard 19s
I have a hard 19
This is terrible
Couple hours of studying and you should be set.
Couple hours of studying didn’t help this time
a couple of hours of studying if you get the concepts
You mean the 3 week class in jan?
I do want a break
I don’t think I’m taking a winter class
Depends though
So it really depends on what courses they’re offering
i need to think about if i'd do a minor degree
The nursing schedule had some 15/17 credit hour places where I could probably squeeze classes if there’s no clashing times
> they'd b v fast
@howdy_.  right but it’s only one class
But I don’t know who knows
Credits aren’t the issue though it’s the times, like clinical is 4 hours for now and my lecture is nearly 3, any classes I wanted to do would be during that time
Because I thought I read something about that but idk
Oh damn
So after undergraduate you go straight to grad school for nursing at cwru?
Sorry I have no idea how nursing works
I’ll go to grad school if someone will pay for me, but a bachelors or associates gets you working
I don’t know how the abbreviations work there are so many
Not too bad
Yea NP is my ultimate goal but I refuse to pay to go back, I’m going to need my boss to pay
yeah and they’ll likely pay for it, that’s what my moms hospital did at least
i hate game theory
john nash was a stupid ass nerd
> Getting bosses to pay for higher education >>>>
@mootdoot  my dad’s work paid for most of his MBA education
some companies might comp engineering grad degrees but idk
my brain hurts
Rip
i dont even have a car RON
I have my math exam in less than an hour
Not to mention I still have homework to do
i'm still gonna do nothing but this time i'm not gonna feel guilty abt it
cuz no homework or readings to do
i dont want u to fail
I am very fortunate to miss the unending shit stains from this weeks clinical
thats not fair
someone else should have to handle excrement
wtf
Yea Bc we can’t do much except

if i went to nursing school and right out the gate they were like k scrub this geriatric ass
I’m just barely holding on until I can volunteer or work at rainbow babies
Bc I saw old man pp and I almost felt like doing a Murder
cuz isnt there alot of medicine?
if they had specifications u could choose no one would want to scrub ass
I mean if you work on certain floors if there aren’t enough assistants u gotta do it urself, still important to learn just hate doing it
arent ppl who do vaccines and blood drawing like a legitimate profession in and of itself
whats the worst that could happen
Or else ull get mad ppl like me who get stuck 3 times
isnt there litterly a job for a guy that reads the dial and says ye, thats the right ammount of drugs for him
a knife is a large needle if you dont think about it much
and leave some screwdrivers n stuff in a body
but thats like a car
Two-wheeled car
do colleges usually get columbus day off? i remember it happening in hs, but it didnt happen here
Phew I’m tired
This year because of Covid we didn’t
I only have the last method left
there may be some pleeding later if my smol brain doesnt start working
The extra credit method is so damn easy
The 6th one do be confusing tho
Fuck Christopher columbus
but is still got some tests so project is not major import rn
Not if they are dead
barbara snyder's nasty old clamshell is not affiliated with this university any longer
I am head of the association kf American universities so I still hold sone power over your ass
didnt think so
Can someone call Chris and tell him to release our math scores?
banana phone

Meg on a serious note what’s the difference between a nose test and a mouth one
Like isn’t everything the same inside whether it’s nose or mouth
5 minutes later realized I put pneumonia and not strep
Also mouth goes down nose goes up that’s why
I'm trying to figure out if a guy is hacking among us so that he's imposter more often
if it happens again make him leave and rejoin
i mean idk how u could hack it like that...
apparently you can, there's a bunch of those hacks online
Cameron don't quibble over such trivial matters
Let the fucking bastard die
but we've never actually used it...
mostly because no one else really wants to
that's fair
rip
at least without an essay
how does it relate to a spreadsheet tho?
How come you lost it
I'm trying to make my own vr game rn
Oh shit

So if anyone wants to capitalize on that but with better flavors
Never had it

i don't get what ur saying
kill me
Yesterday I showed my code to a TA and she was really impressed
> what about testing?
@kaori_flute  that’s left
But testing for this one won’t take time
Cause there aren’t that many methods
Cause I don’t have it anymore
bro i dunno how to code
bye pri
Bye pri
couldn't do the last method
fucking crazy hard ot do the diagonal
not gonna do the last one i think
it'd be super sus if i submitted something ccause its so obvious i wouldn't be able to do it
yeah it seems a lot easier than the last two methods
not doing the last>>>> not doing anything
did not get the chance to do much cuz we had a presentation today :)))))
adding to that dunno how to code
finished it today
won't have to do more for it
The class is over for the semester?

Omg geek squad
I actually don't know what the results would be if you had two groups of first time offenders, and you did reformation tactics on one, and left the others alone, what the reoffense rate of the first group compared to the second would be
Ugh doesn’t everything
like quantum phenomena, wtf is that shit
Hated my physics class
Fuck physics
Never had a stats class tho
i took ap stats but i didnt care then lol
Rip Fejes not knowing that leutner is just take away meals and that those of us on campus are fucked
We’re supposed to plan and make a meal
> Rip Fejes not knowing that leutner is just take away meals and that those of us on campus are fucked
@mootdoot  lmao really?
Yea she still thought it was buffet style and we had to explain to her that it’s just takeaway packs
I have corona tho
i think i passed my covid test i studied rly hard so i feel good
the only test i've managed to pass so far ^^^
cuz getting a negative on this one means passing
I got 5 points back on my exam which means that my midterm grade is still an A
HOLY SHIT MY 6th METHOD IS WORKING
There hasn't been a murder in the crime log as far back as 2016 though
I haven't looked further than that
Holy shit
still
stuck o
i wish
I cant figure this out and the hour of midnight draws ever closer
How bad should I feel?
if the chips aint 1/2 air they pringles
except brains
the reason bags of chips have so much empty space is bc they're full of nitrogen gas which retards the oxidation process
so it's not "air" technically speaking
but idk it seems like a lot of unnecessary polypropylene
They’ll come with corona tho
Imma cry internally
I hate technology
On my bio exam
bye sarah
i take small breaks but never start working
my head hurty
head hurty
@epi7844 if you figure it out lmk I'm stuck in mud
I have resigned myself to get a shit grade in this project, maybe even the class
I've only used while and for
i tried this:  builder.append(s.charAt(i++));
only 6 hours left
but this hoe due at 12
Rip
ruin my whole mf week 😠
idk
BRO FUCK this project
fuck nah
I found the one for mormons and jehovah's witnesses, and we need a third group
My brother did it once to someone that pissed him off and now their parents hate us
will fail the project :"))))))
Aww y’all hating on programming? Can you hate on technology some more on my behalf
I am going to loose my shit
> I am going to loose my shit
@epi7844  me when I couldn’t answer 5 mc questions because the pictures wouldn’t show up
like if I get a method wrong but had a decent loop or wtv will I still get some credit?
But yea if loops work we get partial credit
With all the 2 ounces of hope I have left for this semester
Dunno
Didnt get an email so not my problem
*for the record I haven’t tested at all*
I don’t think I’m going to test for this, if I didn’t get an email I assume I wasn’t even close to being near to them
No the email abt ksl being closed
I almost went there on Wednesday but I went to Tink instead
*Gets reported for a crime when the TA doesn't get it and you said you've just killed a man*
Either that or he/she will think why I’m questioning life
its just starting to dawn on me how screwed i am
like it wasnt hitting, now it rammed me all at once
java sucks so much
I am on the verge of dropping this class
its just a pain
umm that would make me the devil tho
kill
Yea I do the killing
oh me
Idk ur lovely fuck all the others
the last 4 imo
nope
I havent started 5 or 6
i kinda tried 4 and then gave up COMPLETELY
I dont even know how to simulate testing for that
i dunno if im just dum, but it just dont make sense
what dont make sense to me
he didnt cover some of this
so they dont get an ez a
but that leaves us trying to figure dafuq is going on
I have come to a conclusion: I am not fit for the academic world, I should just be your classic mexican construction worker and have a normal house and a normal wife and a normal family make normal income and die a normal death
but the first one isnt graded for me yet
so i couldnt tell u
i dunno how to help u with 5
cuz i have not done that yet 🔫
im asking what happened to you
i dunno why it's not recognizing the class
oh
i tried
did not work
oh
are u still in step 1?
don't judge
i mean 
u will
I wont
> like HW2 a = new HSW();
@epi7844  dont need to make objects if the methods are static
raunak do u have any idea why it's not working?
im considering pissing on my laptop and fucking off to bed
i can't test anything if this ain't working
*class is unrecognized*
oh
> raunak do u have any idea why it's not working?
@kaori_flute  umm idk I might have to take a look at the code
Idk hwo to help u
fuck me man
oh
Anyone want anything rn?
theres only 3 hours left
then I can at least relax and fail instead of failing and stressing
5-6 are the hardest imo, cuz like dafuq we go through arrays diagnolly
but i dont want to attempt it

Oh

if you guys arent that sucks
jaffeerrrrr 
:nkowuah: 
do u have any idea why HW2.etc did not work?
cuz we *have* to use "." cuz it's a class.
as long as its a character class method
idk how drjava works so i cant really say
although i have ```public class HW2{}```
really?
I want to commit self hommicide
There are 554 people in this server, so I put an intro in intro like months ago

You still have about an hour and a half left
i didnt do 4, just jubberish
uh oh
if anyone needs cs motivation I can join horny jail and give it to anyone who wants it
except howdy is king
did someone request the **bullying service?**
i said it was someone
even tho I'd never bully howdy even if he deserved it
a king that needs to do his java project
cause I'm an adult now
im tired asf
and even though only 2 of my 6 methods work 100% ion care
i would never imply you have bedbugs
Oh
you literally said you wanted to go back
I’m sorry but privacy is illegal
but he aint there :thonk:
ouch
if the bedbugs don’t survive in WA
delete this shit
Jared is such a terrible person he could live in the Z\*\*\*\*\*\*\* walmart
i forgot about that
ouch
u can’t bully me like this on the public discord man
you bullied yourself when you said you wanted to be jared's roommate
do you want me to bully myself
ur related to him isn’t that enough
did you at least leave ranch packets to accompany the pee
I didn't know bedbugs ate ranch
wat the fuck
that name is bad
Hey, I'm supposed to be bullying you sarah
i didn’t even dm u i didn’t consent
Ok but you called my name bad

i’m sorry for being mean

> now i dare someone to ping you
@sar.hh
@sar.hh you suck
I found out today that 90% of all campus covid cases have been linked to small spreader events. It's literally being spread mostly by people violating the "Stay the fuck out of each other's fucking rooms" rule
someone in a p tough spot rn
damn
Oh I succeeded
I was unfortunately up until 7:05 am dealing with the people involved
if its an illegal gathering, why doesnt campus police take care of it
are you out on patrol again this friday night, or you think its too cold for ppl to go out
I did walk my building though and it was really quiet
There were people in Raymond breaking covid guidelines but I had some homework to do so I unfortunately left them
Oh
Worst halloweeen
who needs parties when you have the jumbo sized costco bag of chocolate to urself
we aren't stupid
It's almost more fun to sit in the common room and just look at my phone because there is only one entrance into the building and people have to do the walk of shame past me
Also Narrator: Zach didn't feel like dealing with bullshit, and just wanted to make sure he wasn't going to aspirate in the next 30 minutes
i doubt i'll meet any of them, i've only been near the rha office once and thats cuz i was testing a switch over there
RHA is all students and they aren't under our department
but arent u a student
dang, im surprised there are so many aplicants
i thought they just kinda told go find house
i find a spike bat is useful for that :P
Sometimes boyfriends and girlfriends/ other partners live together and disagree and that makes it very terrible for the rest of the suite
Because if you are somebody who is clean, and you have a suitemate that bombs the kitchen whenever they cook
*all the more reason to live alone :P*
Because I don't want to see that
Last year a kid knocked on my door and said that it sounded like a girl was getting beat up in the room next to him
and I went, and was about to knock on the door and I heard the *sounds* and I told him to go hang out in the common room or put some headphones on
Nobody needs to see that
100% still happening, but i cant hear em :P
I had another resident last year who ended up injured because he and his girlfriend fell out of his high lofted bed while fornicating
The slats on the side don't seem to be that weight-bearing
lmao wtf
wood can be surprisenly strong sometimes, those beds are probably on the weaker sides since you know, been there for 60ish yrs, but they havent collapsed yet i guess
God I wish I could see the audit logs in this server
Still, there's the diamonds in the rough like priyanka's
There is one server I am a mod on that has a completely clean audit log
And I really can't stand them

A very complicated system where nurse took my id and have to parents then parents got in room then gave id back to nurse that put back in bag
fair, they just trying to not get every1 sick
Good on them, but then my parents tried to drop off chicken for me at like 2am and it was a Struggle
It was so sad and cold, but sometimes sacrifices must be made
atleast they didnt give up trying to get it to you, they could've quit cold turkey
damn ron went to sleep

Sigh
Isn't it 3 am rn

Open tje door for me
Zhanda I'm going to have your ass on the next plane to houston so fast
@raunakwastaken you literally told me how you were supposed to fix your sleep schedule for navratri. Where tf is your dedication to Hinduism
Telling another man to oil up
omg exposed
> @raunakwastaken you literally told me how you were supposed to fix your sleep schedule for navratri. Where tf is your dedication to Hinduism
@sprinkles2108  you don’t need to call me out like that
Everyone raunak isn’t as religious as he claims to be
It’s 5:31 pm here though
> Y’all shit
@raunakwastaken  no u
ok ive filled my stupid bitch quota for the day im gonna skedaddle
Bye
Bye
Or did I fabricate that in my head
Oh continental
Don’t do ap, profit :Stonks:
> Don’t do ap, profit :Stonks:
@mootdoot  AP helped me not take psych 101 with y’all
And I got credit for math
Next sem tho
Even though I didn’t use one of them
However, I mean in this in the nicest way, I don't consider any pandemic AP tests valid because if you look at the google search data it is perfectly aligned with search terms from the test at that time, even by time zone
Next sem I’m taking a 200/300 level psych class I think
What sucks is I have to take higher level English and poli sci classes to get credit for Lang and gov
-When pri finds out med schools don't want you aping out of requirements
I didn’t AP out of chem 105 lol or Calc 2
I could’ve taken Calc 223
Or no math this year
But since med schools wanna see math grades
I personally disregard most of what that man says because I he told me I was too dumb to be a doctor but in reality I had a testing issue that is now fixed and I have a 4.0 in all of my higher level classes since then
I suck at test taking
Also wow I can’t believe he said that to you?
Tip 1: Take 20mg of Fluoxetine daily to alleviate the OCD symptoms. 
Tip 2: Go to disability resources after an independent exam and get 1.5 test time
Somehow this recent bio exam went relatively well for me
Oh
For me timing isn’t an issue
It’s just test taking skills
For me timing is an issue because I couldn't physically move past an unanswered question and it would instead cause a panic attack
Also no matter how much I study the textbook I miss small details
Oh
I studied much more hardcore for this bio exam
I do really well on labs, I study really hard, I am even fine with memory based quizzes
The system fucked up so I don’t know what my true mc score is yet
> I do really well on labs, I study really hard, I am even fine with memory based quizzes
@toomanyzs  me too!!!!
Right know I'm pissed because I'm working on a diprotic acid titration lab
Me watching you vent not knowing wtf potentiometric is: 👁👄👁
And also I don't know the degree to which KH2PO4 dissociates before its pKa
I’m so sleepy
For keeping a store open
Ah I envisioned you (even though I don't know what you look like) working at like Yankee Candle
Was having a good day until checked my psychology syllabus and saw I had 2-3 page paper due Monday :Gundma:
Assignment says 2-3 pages but we’re submitting a text box? Don’t make sense I think
What if I sleep instead
> Sleepy is stopping me from watching this movie
@raunakwastaken  that’s your ancestors telling you to fix your sleep schedule
@raunakwastaken durga ain't playing around
am I supposed to draw this
> @raunakwastaken durga ain't playing around
@chandachan  LMAOOOO💀
**in exam**
> This monstrosity made its way into my pchem notes
@toomanyzs  bruh the 2D heating curve on the chem exam screwed me over because I realized last minute that some H values were in kJ and not joules
Then the last two values were in kJ
I realized 3 minutes before the exam was over
not a stalker sorry
>   that’s your ancestors telling you to fix your sleep schedule
@sprinkles2108  😧
> This is my supplementary information
@sprinkles2108 unfortunately it is too late to provide any supplemental information.
Well @megmcmuffin22 and @sprinkles2108 are both wrong. My major, as I have stated before, is Chemical Biology, which is a single major. It is not biochemistry because biochemistry is "oops, all boring ass protein folding" chemical biology is very much geared towards pharmaceutical chemistry, and my major is the chemistry major, but just with the bio core sprinkled in, which the regular chemistry degree doesn't have
"Biochemists are people who talk biology with chemists, and chemistry with biologists, so nobody ever wants to talk to them."
> @sprinkles2108 unfortunately it is too late to provide any supplemental information.
@raunakwastaken  ITS NEVER TOO LATE
STOP BEING SOME ELITE COLLEGE
You work hard, and that's what counts for me.
Sarah its more of a concentration, yes. A normal Chemistry major doesn't have to take the bio, but has to take a bunch of shitty math, and I don't have to take the shitty math, and I'm good at bio
he didnt take enough math he forgot what plus meant
Couldn’t be me
Though this exam went better for me I think?
>  no this is demonstrated interest
@sprinkles2108  we don’t have a policy of demonstrated interest
You wanted dedicated smol brains
> Raunak?
@sprinkles2108  bro I woke up after 2 hours of sleep
Nope no mercy
@raunakwastaken I’ve functioned with 0 hours of sleep before
Ey yo Bader wants to host an Among Us torunament

Final is 35 for what class
@2waynice we need to get our act up if high school students are coming on here to get a glimpse of our conversations 💀
Predicting his exam score
Sometimes my intuition is so accurate it’s scary
he said it didn't go well
*last time he said that, he had a 92*
Oh I actually felt bad for  a second
He could be a fucking premed with that attitude
cuz im already out here sailing the 7 Cs
this was the reaction to the last test
I realized that I’m not capable of bme pre med lmfao
I'm absolutely on Magnitude 10000000 vibes because there's been a difficult thing in my lab report that I couldn't figure out and it was causing me to procrastinate and be anxious and I hung out with my mom today because she came up to see me bc she hasn't since May and it was really relaxing bc I'm a big family person, and I'm very close with my parents, and I came back and started working on the lab and I just figured it all out and I'm just barreling through it now
And I can use my epic error prop equation from my last lab too
DONT GET ME STARTED
still? it never wasnt great
@jaff_er still haven’t written my sages draft

> damn, i need to join that class
@howdy_.  no joke I was deadass sleeping in bed

At least my exams are over
sigh
it’s all pain and suffering
its metacarpal monday
jaffer aren't you living in the dorm where people get drunk
i dont need it unlocked
I do have to be there, because it is a hard master key
Anyways, if you have your phone you can unlock your own door through myhousing but some people are too small brain to operate Duo
You guys obv don't have the write up button nor the access to the rosters
the thing is zach, if im locked out, then i dont got a phone, so its a lose lose situation
Not everyone is as smart as you, Howdy. Some ppl still don't unsterstand hoe duo works.
duo sucks
i dont any notifs
and i have it on both my ipad and phone
plus, it doesnt tie into the 2fa i use
however ppl arent good w/ secure passwords
cuz they get into that
I can’t say if you’re kidding
@kaori_flute it doesn't work i tried it on email

So tired
Ugh
And we don’t get a break til N O V E M B E R👁👄👁
And  that week will be wasted by studying for finals
till friday i don’t think i have anything much
fuck
@sprinkles2108 It depends. The intro classes are hard for the sake of weeding people out, and there are many classes which are easier even though the material is harder because the quality of teacher is better. The prime example of this is Biol 215, with Valerie Haywood, who is my least favorite professor at this school
BADER DOESNT TEACH 215???
Imma cry
However last year haywood made 215 extremely easy due to the panemic
I’m tryna improve in chem so drew can drop my E2 score (it hasn’t come out yet)
> However last year haywood made 215 extremely easy due to the panemic
@toomanyzs  oh

@toomanyzs  Priyanka see I told you it might become easier
Though
Oh f
Typing out work is half the battle
Oh
To prove it’s me taking the exam
> But seeing the rampant cheating in Math 121 has changed my mind
@toomanyzs  how’d you find out
Are you an SI for math?
Oh
bruh people are cheating wtf
Miller was actually my resident last year
Math 122 scores are distributed everywhere lmfao
i hate people who cheat
Yeah apparently 122 is okay
121 because it is multiple choice I guess people just head over to symbolab and poke in the answer
But doesn’t canvas track if you switch tabs lmao
Oh
omg people out there cheating :angery:
All of my classes are answers in canvas, no credit without submitting pictures of your work
I WISH DREW DID THAT FR
I WILL GLADLY SUBMIT WORK
> But doesn’t canvas track if you switch tabs lmao
@sprinkles2108 rly? :eyesmagik:
AND ILL GLADLY DO IT ON LOCKDOWN TOO IF HE REALLY WANTS TO RECORD ME
JUST LET ME HANDWRITE MY WORK
I FEEL THAT PRI
Rip
We have to type out our work
Oh yikea
No handwriting work is much easier than typing it out
> As you can see, Pchem is Daddy drew chem but calculus
@toomanyzs  damn
i dont want people to know me now
What is pchem I am feeling dumb
> i dont want people to know me now
@raunakwastaken  why...?
he prolly enjoys teaching that class the most
something creepy/weird happened with me
and i dont want people to know who i am
SO DREW HAS YOU SUBMIT WORK
Oh
Oh
She went to Carnegie Mellon then Stanford then Caltech
Oh
So sometimes she has trouble getting things across that we are like "We are physically too stupid to know how to do this pls"
idk who the professor is
by difficult do you mean he is a strict grader or the class is hard
Pro tip for ENGR 145: Go to TA office hours before exams, they'll tell you everything
class is hard
He's a really chill guy tho, right Michael
> Pro tip for ENGR 145: Go to TA office hours before exams, they'll tell you everything
@bravo5127 ope

Nah all my friends are engineers though

Foundations 
Critical literacy/ activism
Dunno why this 4th hour is being a panel
don't quote me on this but i think you can take it instead of two different chem classes for some majors
really?
damn
it's not horrible
i won't say that the material is easy
rip
damn
and some weeks (last week) your TA just forgets because he's studying for his own midterms, so you don't have to do any work
i mean do you want the book
especially when half the TAs lobby the professor to give people points when they didn't show up
show work*
like it's the equivalent of asking someone to show work for reading a graph
oh
pinkie promise on the condition that you are able to effectively utilize the 3 hours of SI time a week
i think they're in damage control mode because of the courses bad R
oh god, what happened?
or no my bad
damn
@howdy_. left me on read 😔
@nobelium19 for engr 145, you need chem as a prerequisite
> I got credit for chem111
@nobelium19  aren’t you pre med
ENGR 145 isn't that bad
Oh
Damn
Bruh people do be hating Drew though
damn
Damn
oh sorry
i swore you are in math 221
Even though I could’ve
oh boi
I regret not taking 223 once I realized he taught it
oh his lecture pacing is slower than a turtle
Got his math PhD a few weeks before school started
but i get soooooooooo bored
Drew said in his first Bohr video that the Bohr model is very wrong
“This is wrong but you still need to know it”
this ain't true, but some old white guy in 1902 thought of it so you need to learn it
> “This is wrong but you still need to know it”
@sprinkles2108  drew failed the vibe check
When drew fails us in chem but we fail him in vibe check
I didn’t ask you smh
I don’t have to
> I don’t have to

How am I supposed to know that anger is a common reaction to getting discharged from the hospital
Never heard of that ever
Who as ever gotten upset to leave the hospital outside of a Child?
BRUH why would you want to prolong the "nurse-client relationship" aint nobody paying for that
I stg if my report gets erased midway this week like it did last time I will cry
I will deadass internally cry
Looked at my first hospital bill after I turned 18, I think dying is a better choice
> Looked at my first hospital bill after I turned 18, I think dying is a better choice
@mootdoot  US healthcare summed up right here
Just after you turned 18?
I did my moms bills when she was busy, its not like there is anything u shouldnt lnow on there
I don’t like going to the hospital when I need to, knowing the price would’ve killed me as I would’ve wanted to go even less
Fair, when my brother got hit by a car we had to fight them not to call wee woo wagen or go to hospital
Isn't there a case one that doesn't cost money
I thought they werent running cuz rona
Ppl were still recruiting so I think they’re still running
I mean the emergencies don’t stop just Bc pandemic
Fair enough

@mootdoot  some people make it obvious
> for the crime of being a young mf

i havent had a fire drill yet, only some idiot hotboxing
I was the one who smeared Shit on your showers
Idk
Hotboxing is inefficient I feel
that never happened to me?
Omg julia u have ac?
I shouldn’t have the AC
the only thing that frequently happened in taft was some girl left her underwear in the shower stall
it happened more than once
ope, gonna make couples stuck in the broom closet
and then another time someone ripped the toilet stall door off the hinges
wow living on taft 4 sounds terrible
the amount of hair in the showers is fucking vile
Shelf is taken by Sarah
Omg
with detachable head
I'm pretty sure there's a spigot outside, so you just need your own hose
It’s too early for crackhead hours
Go on and take a shower in the rain
never too early for crack
the communal bathrooms aren’t horrible
Its raining right now
Playing in the rain is fun
No they are someone keeps missing on the toilet seat
it wasnt bad until too many ppl got too comfortable leaving their dirty pads open in the trash
I actually didn't bring any of my decorations bc I was convinced that we were going to get sent home
I want a Chris butler
everyone wants a chris butler
Chris butler used to come TO THE DORMS to do Math review sessions if a floor needed it

i had a burner phone number from alaska that was really similar to a tourist line
Sarah isn't ready for my epic email signature

Unfortunately sarah now has my phone number
Howdy doesn’t count as human in this case
Wrong ra that’ll take so long

This is just as bad as the 1 am Zooms with the Germans
Because I work in a covid lab and these germans are our partners
> Because I work in a covid lab and these germans are our partners
@toomanyzs  damn
It is not drug dev though, its structural biochemistry
i assume they are only there for predictions and arent on transcript
I've had some years where it fell of the deep end and some where I went into maximum overdrive
They are totally made up, my SAGES class has not graded anything so I don't have any idea what that midterm grade even means
Yeah they don't mean anyting
Finals are 3 hours max
I only have 2 actual final exams, the rest I don't have any exams and 1 class I have 1 regular non-cumulative exam, so I'm living the good life 😎
damn
2 GIANT term papers though :/
I just realized, you're in school of medicine
Average Mcat is still 519
I don't think so, maybe a small bit
rip'
rip forehead 😭
REgardless of who you are 516+ is in the money
Because med school classes are only about 125 people
the lowest tier US MD schools are still only like 13%
Texas A&M Medical College
My brother goes to school with George Soros' nephew or son, I can't remember, but he goes by a pseudonym
No Texas schools, they be expensive as shit to apply to
why do some schools grant you automatic admission to their med school
why would you ever want to texas
there's only like 20 per class
far to hot
far too many rednecks
Oh rip, yeah I know
do yo thing zach if I ever need a surgery i might need someone on the inside to do some favors
Oh
i saw someone on insatgram named nobel zhou
Bruh I don't post anything
@toomanyzs There is ABSOLUTELY NO way I'm going to Johns Hopkins because I hate that school
I'd rather die
NYU is the most toxic med school on the planet
That worries me that there is a med school student suicide rate statistic
Go back to your roots nobel: go to china and go to med school there
Oh
oh no carter chen is in my sages
OSU takes a ridiculous amount of CWRU students and OSU undergrads hate it because their med school is much better than their undergrad
> OSU takes a ridiculous amount of CWRU students and OSU undergrads hate it because their med school is much better than their undergrad
@toomanyzs  LMFAOOOOO
zach i think you can get into harvard medical school
I'm going to be lucky to get into a medical school
u mean the school that ACCEPTS u will be lucky 😌
I don't know if it means anything, but the highest MCAT scores I've heard of here at CWRU are all RAs or tied with RAs
> I'm going to be lucky to get into a medical school
@toomanyzs  I’m gonna be lucky if I’m still a pre med senior year
cherish it now it wont happen again
Fax though
So what I'm hearing is I need to find my RA and find the ways of the premed
Holy shit
I just don't like other premeds
Damn
I guess Zach hates me
> I guess Zach hates me
@sprinkles2108  everyone hates you 😌
Aren’t you doing something with bio and chem tho?
girl u dont even have a gpa yet
We need to remove some of them
u dont even have grades so u cant know
Helping who I can and comforting those who I can't
Bruh Hopkins accept this man before it's too late
No don’t meet me
Go away
I was kidding. Don’t ignore me guys I’m lonely
It's not a bad thing
I just realized not everyone is a freshman
So I feel like I should re introduce myself
couldnt be a case student
Oh god I'm so sorry
Didn't they get slammed for having a campus that's like falling apart
Don't say
Thats the only school that I got close to
Zach you should have went to Rice stick it up for H-town
The only elittttte school
I applied rd and was waitlisted unfortunately
I don't know how I got into all those other schools and just flat reject at NU
lol i didn’t ED anywhere
Say what you want but colleges be waitlisting me left and right
I really wanted to go to Columbia
There's a kid in my grade who got a 36 ACT and 1600 SAT
Holy shit
thats a rip
Damn that’s impressive
Bruh no it isn't if I can't get accepted lol
upenn is that jagour school
And I didn't know
I only applied to 4 Ivies though
imagine applying to overrated rich ppl school
couldnt be me
Don’t come at me
Just because you didn't get in doesn't mean you aren't an ivy caliber student
Someone should rent out the ivyrejects.com domain and let it direct to case's homepage
incase u havent seen
L> There's people at case who are far stronger candidates for ivies etc than people I know who go to ivies
@toomanyzs  damn
i guess u wanted to be banned
I feel like your undergraduate years are what you make out of them, so the university you go to shouldn't really matter if you stay on top of everything
There's a girl on my RA staff who has a 522 MCAT (100th percentile) a perfect 4.0, 5 published papers, she's a 3 year RA, and already is doing the Master's degree I want to do
> I feel like your undergraduate years are what you make out of them, so the university you go to shouldn't really matter if you stay on top of everything
@chandachan  can I stay on top of you 👉👈
> I feel like your undergraduate years are what you make out of them, so the university you go to shouldn't really matter if you stay on top of everything
@chandachan  facts
Also high school doesn't mean anything
Nothing means anything
FUCK THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT THEIR HS CAREER LIKE IT DOESNT MATTER
Life doesn’t matter
until you get to college
Couldn’t be me
Or a really prestigious award
i would write -> didnt fail
didnt u just introduce us to that guy who just joined abit ago
Though there are people from my hs but they’re older than me here
I also wanted a fresh start but this start doesn’t seem to be staring and I’m stuck at my home
I haven't had to hear it this year because I don't hang out in the common room and listen to the First semester AP Score/ACT/SAT/Subject Tests/GPA/Recc letters dick measuring contest
But the thing that fucking makes me explode is when a newly minted freshman says "Um I'm actually a junior by credit hours"
> But the thing that fucking makes me explode is when a newly minted freshman says "Um I'm actually a junior by credit hours"
@toomanyzs  LMFAOOOOOOOO
I only took 1 AP as I had to cover the syllabus in a month and it costed 200$
Then come here, sit by me. You should know how to get around, uh, here's some advanced orgo 2, that's due tomorrow, also here are the 9000 responsibilities that you have, oh you don't have your capstone planned? hmm
damn collegeboard be milking the hell out of internationals

You know what happens to juniors who don't have that? they don't do well
> I only took 1 AP as I had to cover the syllabus in a month and it costed 200$
@raunakwastaken  200????
I want an MPH lol
> Imagine being confident enough you could learn a year worth of material in a month
@kogarishi  couldn’t be me
I could never wtf
I’d fail
@toomanyzs I though you said not me with a 120 ladies a DaY
rona really hurting zachs ho bis
I don't have time for a woman
Not fair if I can't put enough effort and time into a relationship. Better off not forcing something half-assed, and waiting for when I can really make it work, and have a more enriching experience as a result.
Damn
@sprinkles2108 imagine having the opportunities to deny relationship couldn’t be me
Damn who the real player out here
Because I’m brown and plus i wasn’t into some of the guys who creeped on me frankly
> Damn who the real player out here

@sprinkles2108  *stop calling me out*
Well I also lost like 40 pounds and grew a beard and also just learned to pay attention to signs, and you also just get introspective and insightful about your own flaws; what you need to actively work on not just for a partner, but also to grow yourself
Don’t know who that is
Well I'm already pretty tall so it wasn't that dramatic
> I just thought I’d help him put a name to the anon wimp
@sprinkles2108  I can’t do this rn
zach how did you lose 40 lbs i thought it was freshman 15
But when I came into college I was absolutely ripped because I was a construction worker and that all went away very quickly
I lost 14 pounds in the last year
I don’t even know how
I just ate less?
Like I was less hungry
I didn’t even do it on purpose
I don’t gain or lose weight anymore
So I wouldn’t be as hungry
I need to effectively work so I'm closing Discord, gn y'all
All of the working out I did was cardio and running and stuff, but I like to lift much more
I used to be able to bench like 290, 300
> I used to be able to bench like 290, 300
@toomanyzs  and the flexing streak continues
Zach you should go to the nfl combine after med school
Imagine getting into med school
Bruh why do I have a reddish line running down my nose
I don’t know if it could be me
Zach had a really bad freshman year Gpa lmao
Imagine being ripped @toomanyzs couldn’t be me
Imma cry
wish I could hug you bro
But the worst shrekkings I've received were in Stem classes
Also I’m sorry :(
You will get into a med school
we went through um

Galan was my father idk

Because I showed him the fuck up
@toomanyzs sorry bud
my sample session was fucking terrible
Kaley (idk how to spell her name) was a MASTERFUL Si
Either engr 131 or biol 321 to satisfy programming requirement for neuro
The professor goes on about how difficult it is and she makes it because she wants it to be hard
ugh matlab
But doesn't teach you any fundamentals
its coming and i dont want it to
Either engr 131 or biol 321 for programming req lmaooooo
Engr 131 without a moment hesitation

I had a TA pair, one who graded like he was trying to get a golf score
rip
don't take 300-level phys if you don't have to
so beyond 100 level courses, they normally don't take physics?
Aren’t 121 and 122 the only phy reqs
nope, took it last year
imagine taking a above 100lvl class
couldnt b m
And I guess a lab too for physics? Dunno the course code though
Did you die?
I died in quantum
damn time be flying by fast on discord lmfao
Majority of their work would’ve been correcting the tests
Where can I find that
I don’t know where to look
I guess
idk
I think I'm taking Chem 306, Pharm 303 (I don't know the number), Chem 233 if its inperson,
It took me to the page im already at
But not broken down into years
Idk I'm doing my MCAT this winter rather than the spring so I can take more courses in the spring
Has anyone taken "enhanced" physics classes like 123 or 124? How difficult are they?
Neuro isn’t on there though
I’m so scared for my bio exam grade I’m having an internal panik attack
And I’m so sleepy
Like I’m too tired to study

I go to either the Alley Cat oyster bar downtown
If I'm feeling family food lol
damn they don't teach Italian at cwru
Pasta has very few ingredients, the key is to have the right amount of gluten in the flour, so always get high quality flour, and also execution of the kneading, etc. Because pasta forms these long saccharide chains which are formed and broken by kneading styles
Wtf
Idk if that's small
On the coast if I’m not wrong
But I may be wrong
Oh
Really??
Yea the whites left their culture the last time they were here
But too far back
So I knew plenty of people growing up who only spoke broken english
But had a hard life
That's still over half of my exaggeration
Dead chat
Sad
!!ALERT!! If anyone gets an email like this, don't click on the link. It's fake.
utech doesnt sign like that, and it would be through the ticketing system
But I might be wrong tho
Idk
> utech doesnt sign like that, and it would be through the ticketing system
@howdy_. ok but some people here wouldn't know that. Some people here don't even know how to check email.
These white scrubs...this rain
lol, the rain is just going to turn into snow
doesnt actually exist
That’s fine I love cold weather and snow despite my shitty body

I hate companies who change icons for no reason
Though, there is a way to get the old logo back
whose is telling the intern they have some busy work for them 2 do
Oh mines still the same

Now why is case watering the grass in the rain

Dang I haven’t listened to her shit in a minute
Nah it’s y’all that are wrong
eye--
raunak, ur just wrong
Y’all ever think about a test you just took and realize you did one of the questions wrong
Thank you Julia!!🥺🥺 idk about that yet but I think i messed up one of the short answer questions
I don’t know if you had the question I’m worried about
I said the splicing one but two people said the nonsense one and now I’m worried
> raunak, ur just wrong
@howdy_.  **no**
oh shit yeah
im sorry 😭
idk what to do
I’m tired of college
excessive sugar is bad
Can someone ban college?
sugar in the bread does not mean unhealthy it just means theres sugar in the bread
WHY IS DISCORD SO ANNOYING
connie is a woman stupid
:XMARK6: **error 404**, you can't use that.
OH
:XMARK6: **I have to rearrange my life**, you can't use that.
I’m sorry jenin
-8ball should raunak leave right now forever without a fuss
-choose raunak leave, raunak leave
And wants jenin to leave

thats how mishima died
THE WORLD HAS NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THE JAPANESE PREFER DEATH TO DISHONOR
I’ll use it to cut vegetables
unfortunately 
honor won't be restored even if raunak stabs himself
but it will be satisfactory for some
Wtf
u dont have to do math when u cant even eat on your own
mine looks better though
isnt that android
Might be laptop
> mine looks better though
@kaori_flute  no
> @raunakwastaken ew simp
@kaori_flute  wtf
that means ur either on a android or a computer
its how we're able to keep everything consistent
cuz unicode standardizes things
dunno how tho
i’ll do it. don’t test me😤
teacher: I cant let you go early, that would be cheating you out of ur education, why dont we spend the rest of the time doing a practice quiz
knowing roman i bet he didn’t fill out the housing notification form by the 12th either
oh that’s probably really bad
@kaori_flute nope this has happened before
> @kaori_flute  why is it smol
@raunakwastaken dunno
:XMARK6: **I have to rearrange my life**, you can't use that.
that ain't valid
never
errors never have power
And he didn’t even bother to tell us
Yea I hate A6
Too much work
why wont this man leave me be :pepecry:
I need nap
Why is freud so fuvkin stupid
honestly most of his ideas were pretty decent for a time except anything about oedipus or penis envy. That shit was probably from a bad crack trip
pri you said a few months ago
find it yourself freud lover
I hate online communication
I really used “was” twice
freud: women have repressed memories of their fathers sexually assaulting them which only *I* can recover
freud: just kidding they made them up cuz they wanted to fuck their dads secretly
Idk what that is I was just tb odepious complex or whatevertf
because apparently the natural disgust of incest isn't real to freud
I don’t remember which one that is
@toomanyzs do u know if I am allowed to leave non perishable foods in my room over break?
The thing is just no gross shit in the fridge
And also last year we decided that we aren't taking out trash for people when we do checks
Oh my plan is to not eat out so I can clear out my fridge before I leave
So if you wanna leave trash then you get 2 month old trash 🙂
Yeah, you're allowed to leave anything you want except for trash and perishable food
The only time you have to move all of it out is at the end of the School Year
Aw dang I should capitalize on that and get into triangle towers
Tho*
But I realized even if I get an apartment round these parts I’m still gna have to deal with stairs so 🤷🏾‍♂️
Youd have 2 do quick maths
Eh I’m too lazy to move rooms this year so I’ll still b here spring sem, don’t have to worry abt the math till summer 21
If u want to be pauls, you'd need to film a deady body first
SHame
My family in Bedford was so grateful to have me Bc I was able to get baby to sit and b quiet
Think that says more abt their parenting skills tho
Ppl are too lazy even for that tho
Fair enuff
I’m never lazy with children
2nd graders need a ta []_[]
Bc they were “too rowdy” also larger class sizes fucking over teachers
Large class sizes are fucking over everyone
Being a daycare worker is my backup job if my body fails me
I never said that
if you ever need to get bailed out
How does it even work if not everyone is on at the same time?
I haven’t played in like a month 😭😭😭
Rip
Minecraft isnt on steam 5head
I don’t have anything on steam except rancher

And an interesting fact we found that hasn’t been discussed in class

Dead chat
Close enough
And there is exactly a month left of in-person
Which means that the only option is to quarantine the whole campus
If it gets really bad
And while we may get close, I don't think we will get there
IS Smith having yet another fire alarm
Wtf
Haven’t had French toast in a minute
i miss good breakfast food
Honestly Ohio people fucking suck at making breakfast you should come to texas and eat our morning meals because Ohio people are constantly in want of a nutrious meal
nah fam I just miss my mom’s cooking 🥺
if your mom isn't from texas then her cooking sucks
and you can tell her I said that, Zhanda from 77458 Houston Texas, USA said that your cooking IS FUCKING TERRRIBLE and that you should perhaps start considering different vocations other than cooking because you're doing a horrible job
you dont cook that either
again, you dont have to cook those
Howdy it stops there, once you say grits, you can't contend with that
slower tho
Ok I’ll stop now sorry😂
Wont
Let me delete an app he hasn’t opened in 4 years
Like wtf

Zhanda Texas does have some really good biscuits and gravy, but unfortunately grits taste like eating very fine gravel
Im not dental tho

Skating looks so fun but I don’t trust myself

I almost busted my shit sliding on this floor in socks
I haven't gone skating in like 8 years
altho I feel like i gonna die every time I do it
My elementary school used to take yearly trips to the skating rink
gotta work at sonic to become pro skaters lol
Oh man I haven’t been to sonic in forever
I think skateboarding would b slightly easier, but it seems more expensive
damn, these prices aint bad
i have no balance tho
But isn’t skating harder?
Okay who wants to finish the papers to turn our cult into a religion and drive down to Chicago
they'll never suspect a thing

My glasses have been broken for like 2 months, but she’s holding on :naenae:
fuck
Why are we fuck
rip
some ppl dont have power
thats a rip
dunno
Omg miss that bunny
I wish I could start my paper 😔 but I’m stuck here fluffing up words for this other sages project due Friday
Issue isn’t word count it’s content :sadcat:
Rip
I submitted it Monday and 30 minutes later she emailed me with 13 questions she felt I didn’t answer properly, told me I didn’t meet the word count, and told me that it was 15% of my grade, then said she hopes I’m doing well 😭:naenae:
damn
also, submitting b4 due date
Would’ve rather taken the L honestly
whats it supposed 2 b about
I think im just mad I had this whole beautifully planned meal and then she emails on Saturday like “no review leutner meal”
She said it wouldn’t b equivalent enough, I had to be able to make the meal or I had to review meal
thats annoying
Honestly if I had known I would’ve just gone and cooked the dumb meal at Bedford
I can’t believe I need to put evidence for this, the ppl cooking at home don’t need to give actual evidence as to why they’re using whole wheat pasta instead of white smh
ye, esp since u did all the prep work
I’m going to be all out of brain juice and I haven’t even started the actual sages paper that makes up 20% of grade
what else happens in the class?
Some mini papers but I think those aren’t a part of grade
Whole point of submitting it early was to get started on paper but now I’m here with no energy to finish this smol assignment let alone start paper smhhhh
Damn sages Hittin hard
I don’t wanna do this college shit anymore
This sages assignment just broke me
I’m gonna tell my mom to pick me up this camp sucks 😤
mom come pick me up im scared
its the right combo of fear, dead inside, and trying to keep it all together
Damb don’t call me out like that 😎
Not from this server, so i wont put it in quotes, but this is a top tier quote
One week I didn’t buy mitchells pint smh
Was trying to save moneies tho
think about it tho
does that even count smh my head
Will probably still buy mitchells tmr
atleast its still sugar
I need to make up all the serotonin I lost
Oh shit den is open
if i had a drone tho, and they would bring the food outside
The way grubhub is just insomnia cookies and an infinite list of closed places, no nightlife smh
cleveland doesnt have a "nightlife" unless you count copius ammounts of drugs and shootouts
Now, I haven’t had a strawberry in a hot minute, but I don’t think so
Fuck sugar rush I’m eating last bag of takis
Ugh my last bag...how will I get more
idk, there are a few around
tis a shame costco doesnt sell costco sized takis
they would be gone so fast
it really would be
I would never crawl out of taki bag
did u not hear last bag, its the emergency funds
I need all to b fully recovered
If I miss one I’ll b forever sad
gotta reach in and grab the takis out of thin air
I too am serious about takis
If we think hard enough, taki will appear
sorry about to nerd
and moving them
If I had to think abt every atom, I wouldn’t even be able to make one single taki spice particle
rip
cuz u kno
i cant do that
since it hasnt been disproven
forgot her name
Yea she just makes it out of her body dw abt it tho she’s fine
I wish I could read
that doesnt work
eat all the fat u want
Yea she makes it out of body fat
cuz even fat ppl, its probs 40-50lb of "fat"
ye, somethings telling me that it isnt hard scifi xD
Like sure she can make tank but don’t expect her to do shit after she’s basically dead
just turn your fat into bazookas
I wish
didnt someone make that
momo is p cool in the way she trains it’s half studying book science half endurance training so she can build more items without burning out
Miss my comics, wouldn’t need takis and 3 fruit snacks if I had them
then we take out leave
Can’t wait to go to my pullbox at my local shop and cry about the price Bc there’s probably like 10 issues in there
if we only got a month left
It do b 2nd of 3 exams
the snacc train never ends
I should sleep I have work at 9
But am tired but wired
its a shame that early morning ppl rule the world
When I work night shift at hospital and get night shift bonus pay 🤪
Yea but bodies r stupid and still go on circadian rhythm
arent you able to change it if you adjust sleep schedule over time
Nah Bc we still operate on light cycles
It’s why schools are annoyingly bright, supposedly keeps u awake and alert
But there’s a difference between the lights, most schools use white light which is supposed to promote learning n brain activity shit
Damn
i need some oj
Just go outside and get the vitamin d naturally
Fuck white lights
outside? couldnt be me
Asphalt isn't concrete
frick light, all my homies hate the light
OH
Uh oh
> its road stuff
@howdy_.  except I didn’t write about roads I wrote about the Pantheon
Fuck no
I’m on almost 70gramsnofnsugar Zach are you sure u want this

That’s kinda like when there was trail of shit in Taplin
i wish the photo was more high rez, but ye, i doubt its drinkable, cuz the coloring and clearity is off
Also Howdy there is a chance I will be working for Ugen in the next couple weeks

However i don't have lab again until 11/16
The lab report i just turned in tonight
i think its mostly so ur teach doesnt have to grade 10million long things
I have only had one bad TA through all of college until this sem
Not me realizing now that I have a math quiz to study for
I woke up looking like Angelica from rugrats, but I didn’t have any ponytail holders in so that’s how my days started
Should’ve brought my brush and gel to lay my shit
Why I didn’t bring it in the first place
Getting worse lol
Howdy I applied to the job last night so we will see

Ain’t no one else drinking that shit
zhanda i dont have the energy to hate you today
Damn Dylan 💔
Fuck vernors tho

and i get sad when something i think is a carbonated drink like ICE or something is actually just fancy water that shook hands with a pineapple
That didn’t stick but the la croix did
wtf
i dont need an instructor
aren't you blonde though
I’m still waiting for Zhanda to roll up on the person he thinks is howdy
im still waiting for zhanda to STERILIZE HIMSELF
Dylan bring the damn gloves come spring

They would def hate u
I don’t take all the blame
I did fuck up on first id Bc I didn’t kno name was not real name
I was talking to my mom so I wasn’t paying attention
that was a damn good wow
me with 20 aleks topics left with about 3h left
I’ve been staring at this sages paper screen with only my heading for about 2 hours and it’s not writing itself??
This laptop is Useless
Sages professor just obliterated that project I redid and I no longer want to do this paper :smile_bruh:
I don’t wann a
She didn’t even put in a grade for it yet just the submission comments and I-😞
I don’t think mine is difficult, it’s the combination of only 5 assignments having weight and personally, I think she’s asking for too much from this specific project
What sages class you have
She said i shouldn’t be comparing bolognese to the poultry intake but it’s Turkey bolognese so it is part of the poultry intake?? :vibe: this ain’t it
Live footage of me omw to writing this email about the comments she left: :drivingworm:
> @_frostyyyyy_  me reading this being in a class where the prof lectures 99% of the time like👁👄👁
@sprinkles2108 

She also lowers grades by half a letter grade per two classes missed
WHAT CLASS
Oh my gosh
The class is called Science and Literature
If the sages is a discussion class like mine, attendance would b heavily counted
I don't even know how I have a high B on attendance, because the attendance grade is also a participation grade and I'm one of the most talkative people during the seminars, while half the class has cameras off and almost never talk
I got an 18.5/20 on participation and it’s because I didn’t put enough comments on Facebook
But I don’t care to or want to use Facebook so I didn’t mind
We rarely discuss in my class👁👄👁
I think I’ve spoken a maximum of 3 times in that class
Depends on the class
Fsso is the social one I think so we’re talking abt issues n shit
The only thing I can think of that could have hit my attendance grade was that I missed one Canvas discussion and then the professor locked it without warning so I could not add my several hundred word long response
Actually I give up on the email I don’t fuckin care anymore :naenae:
you ain't cut from the same cloth as the rest of them
Honestly if it comes down to it at the end of the semester I’ll be annoying as hell and send an email right before grades are finalized
Wtf bro
I’ll send my email if I feel the need
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus are you serious?
Bro I need a nap stop yelling
That’s like the worst
I'm taking Science and Literature, and it's one of the toughest classes that I've ever taken for some reason
literally half of my class was "play x" and write on it
stochastic you gon get murked too talking all that hot shit behind us
sucks to suck, don't it?
Oh this paper is our only paper for the class
crap
i can't remember where we stored the project
Don’t u need that in a few years tho
i still have my groupmates on speed dial
nope
Aw dang I haven’t seen 3 stooges in a minute
Ugh I miss watching umaru
Ron if you need me to hype you up.on front of taplin just ring me
jk jk
pls don't murder me
i mean
pls do
i don't wanna work on aleks
zhanda was that supposed to be "alhamdulillah"
it's never wrong to learn for fun :))))
It's really hard for me to ghost the consonants in words though
It seems like the vowels and their inflection mean more than the consoantns
Like this 不错 is really really hard to pronounce
i was the girl who thought she "lost"
damn
till they stop
you have to go during exam weeks especially
although them bio exams do be kinda steppin it up
im so sleepy
imagine not being sleepy
couldnt be me
i hate schoolwork but mostly cuz i procrastinate
they were done b4 the due date
cuz the knowledge checks just determine if you have to redo some topics on previous A's
well i cant redo the topics
and fuck up on one previous concept
this went from 16-16 to 7-16 after the knowledge check, so when is he taking the grade from it tho
i think the aleks from last week was the last one counted?
idk
i can't remember what he said
If I have to edit this piece of shit leutner meal one more time
If u don’t pass sages idk hopefully I get the guillotine
The way I only have a Paragraph on this dumb paper and wasted a whole 2 hours fixing that meal review really just :pepe_knife_stab:
when is the essay due
that seems suspect
cuz ig it shows effort?
oh
well, i mean, u dont
First draft is due the 30th,
That’s what I don’t GET
what the actual fuck tho
It needs to be 6-7 pages, in MLA format
wtf
its a draft, its supposed to be imperfect and borked
yall need to switch to my sages
its boring, but chill
yeah wtf
who is the prof for the class?
THAT MAKES IT WORSE
I DONT KNOWWWWWWWWWW
Apparently she’s reviewing it for the final draft that’s due November 10th or smth
whose the prof tho, maybe there is some history behind it
damn
thats like 3weeks away
oh i listed that as one of the sages i wanted
how the hell is a 1st draft due 3 weeks b4
I don’t knnowwwwww
I think it’s bc she doesn’t want us to bs a draft or outline
Someone remind me to remove that
I couldn’t think of a good title but I needed a placeholder so i could account for its space, as if that’ll help me get to 7 pages lolll
bruh 0.01 won't make that of a difference
I already know she’s going to tell me my scope is too big and I’m using too much of my own evidence but I’m sorry ur stuff just Isn’t Enough
I really like the topic and wanna talk my shit but she makes it constraining
So now I’m trying to fit it to her standards and that’s why I’m struggling
However this does come with the problem of a ton of revision time :/
Many thoughts, head full
Yea honestly I lost all motivation to do it when I saw the comments she left on my project
cuz if so, miss me with taking another english class
But this “isn’t an English class”
3weeks b4 due date
But it’s just this prompt for some reason combined with my no longer caring for the class is fucking me up
save and close
Honestly in my head I’m either going to go to the writing center next Tuesday or Wednesday or just submit and like find religion or smth
also, isnt the writing center all virtual
I get she wants us to submit it earlier to get feedback quick but honestly if I get shit and I can’t edit it in 2 hours I’ll just save it for final submission
Actually I would’ve quit this paper way earlier but then i started redoing my project then got upset I got distracted
I should’ve spent this time studying for my tests next week :Gundma:
frick sages, all my homies hate sages
but ron, its 1, close the doc and dont think about it
It was all fun and games until last week, she hit me while I was unaware 😔
work on something else for tmmr and see if inspiration hits
It better smh, or I’m going to hit that 4 days of not leaving room to force inspiration to hit
If all the other geniuses of history do it, would probably work for me
Nearly forgot I had work at 9 haHa
I have passed the sleeping window I have hit peak Wired hours
fair enough
brain needs to stop seeing it
Anatomy muscle shit then
It’s just not working out for me but as long as I don’t get in the 70s for overall grade I’ll b fine
If I see 79 my brain b like “oh shit 7 points till failure”
Bc idk if it’s 73 **and** under that’s a failure of it’s **under** 73 that’s a failure
i guess this y i cant b a nurse
I got a 71 on the nursing midterm and almost died but then realized it wasn’t that bad when combined with all my other assignments
maybe it diff for nurse tho
Well on the actual midterm exam I got the 71 but the overall midterm grade was a 80smth Bc I did decent on all the other assignments
Smh den is closed
Shouldn’t u b asleep smh
Stem majors don’t have jobs either?
Boss leaves at 4 so I have to work before then smh
Forgot to set alarm rip
oh no
Yeah I was supposed to wake up at 6 to do work and I woke up around 9:30
he wants to eat it
the math TAs, after screwing us w/ tests are now screwing us w/ quizes
I showed all my work but forgot to write a - sign in my answer
@ math TAs
stop testing my knowledge
I DONT HAVE ANY
The way I needed that so bad, what a qt 🥰
and then took off points from the next question even tho i used the right value there
How I missed 13/40 answers on nursing exam
Honestly TA’s... ugh
Chris is a chill dude, but the TAs are alll shit
Sometimes I wish they were more considerate
the tests arent given partial credit cuz they didnt feel like grading it
Booked it to work and made it :naenae:
I WISH we got partial credit on those tests
im not joking, thats the reason we dont have partial credit on the tests julia
the TAs didnt want to grade them, so they convinced chris to make em all multi choice
Oh ewwww
Oh well nursing shit is all or nothing Bc the nclex is and *they’re preparing us*✨
@chandachan olivia would never do this to us
Now I’m wondering why I showed up to work today
> Now I’m wondering why I showed up to work today
@mootdoot  where do you work
Oh
Yea but I need the filling comfort that comes with a stack of pancakes
Gotta join chris's math class for 10 flapjacks
You also get 10 shit TAs tho
isnt there a math party at the end of the semester
Probably not anymore
Math parties are fun🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
I need it this weekend
Fejes sending out a message saying we shouldn’t edit our posts and reminding that it’s 15% of our grade and that those of us on campus to still b deep and concrete in our analysis
Aw rip
I'm working on it now and I'm 99% sure I'm doing it wrong
understood nothing
and promplty died
Anyone having internet problems?
It’s says it’s due on the 26th so I assumed we could keep editing it until then
But seems like the comments she left were my grade comments lol
I wonder what happened
Right when I was going to make excuse for work computer being down and having to leave
Yeah I'm having slow connections
Guys I went through a whole roller coaster of emotions
I jus want a hug😔
I just have to say, I have a friend at Miami in comp sci and they're not even at methods yet
Wtf are we doing
Connamacher also said that we've already covered almost all of AP Comp Sci would cover just in the first 8 weeks, and that the next 8 weeks will be more difficult
> @sprinkles2108 care to elaborate?
@nobelium19  basically I tried logging into my simbio and I used just my case id and it wasn’t letting me click on sign in, and after panicking and redownlaoding shit and stuff I realized that all I had to do was put @case.edu after my username
I don’t even plan to do my sim bio anymore I’ll do it this weekend
He doesn’t even care
Man still hasn’t graded our m5 homework and midterm grades are due
> I don’t even plan to do my sim bio anymore I’ll do it this weekend
@anjalir519  it’s due at 5 pm...
pri if ur teacher doesnt grade your assignments in a timely fashion ur not required to turn them in on the due date
I mean I’ve worked through it but I’m not 100% on my graded questions so I’ll go back and fix them over the weekend
Dang I missed the hug party
> pri if ur teacher doesnt grade your assignments in a timely fashion ur not required to turn them in on the due date
@2waynice  good point

I guess those Korean lushs b poppin
i didnt even get to peruse the one in cleveland before i left
An ex of mine used to make me drive them downtown to the lush there
might fuck around and eat a policemans face
end sars
Oh noooooooooo
I need cat cafe
cuter: cat or dog?
Haven’t been to pupper cafe but so far these cats at the cafes I go to are winning
dog cafe seems like a bad idea
Nothing beats babies for me tho
Or the boring legal kind?
Bc a lot of people are bad parents
I miss parties 😔
Okay fuck case wifi
Money spraying
Ron brought the money machine
out there buying school clothes
Anyway not getting paid in the traditional sense just money rain
the internet today has been wack
Oh the liltte feet patterns 🥰
oh fuck i have chem in 2 minutes :vibe:
Looks mad but in a nice way
oh god, that dog is going to be completely orange
if that was not a clean bag
i like the idea of an orange dog
when i see ppl who dye their dogs hair it makes me think ur stupid and also an idiot
it was a sled dog
The dog?
Like his dead body?
SICK
is my last anem
There’s Aidan dating Sarah and Aidan in his own damn house and my sages class
The one who hates Halloween
damn okay i had suspected you were in my sages ron but i wasn't sure
Don’t pay attention to how I shit all over the class just 12 hours ago, I wa s a different person back then
what r u thoughts about the class aidan?
and i want to dunk
but i can't
because if i do, i'm the bad gu
isnt the class about food?
what could be bad about food
don't want to upset the balance
I think she was genuinely not knowing but I laughed about it for so long when the class was over
did the words "why are the poor, poor, just get a job lmao" come out of her mouth
But she was Close
shame, when that get dropped i cant stop laughing at whoever said that
and how poor people are kinda screwed into getting diabetes and high blood pressure cause they can only afford shitty food
Yea like theoretically short term money struggles will make u live longer if u do the money shuffle good
But why would I wanna live longer smh
i didn't think the speakers today were bad
although some kid asked the question i was gonna ask but i wasn't sure it was on topic so i didn/t
didn't
Just an example of reasons why Aidan can’t rip apart other ppl
Oh about composting?
but like in the context of the class idk if it's that important
I love all the  times someone mentions that the government isn’t helpful and the class is shook
uh oh
it aint
yes it could but it isn't
it could, but it wont
I just think the class isn’t unhinged enough
that's a fair assessment
Like he says he already is working with people from top schools like Harvard, Yale, Columbia, etc
It’s why this paper is beating my ass, because she wants us to use mainly the evidence she gave us but I can’t support my radical takes with those
> It’s why this paper is beating my ass, because she wants us to use mainly the evidence she gave us but I can’t support my radical takes with those
@mootdoot  f
But now I’m realizing my take really is too hot for this paper
but i don't think i'm gonna end up needing that
“Environmental racism and blm” doesn’t touch on issues of indigenous lands and agricultural practices
if we're supposed to have a narrow scope
She didn’t give enough evidence for us to use
then we kinda say fuck you to the interconnectedness of the issue
but don't
don't
The only evidence I really have outta what she gave us was the environmental racism pig farming and then ??? Make 6 pages of that I guess
6 pages of Inhaling Pig shit
I mentioned to her in our small group meetings about the indigenous land issue and she kinda got it but even if it’s a good take I can’t even do my own research for evidence and use it???
yes but if ron's topic isn't cops then it's out of the scope
also i do feel bad for her with the amount of times her name gets misspronounced
I tried to use the Facebook pronunciation thing to see if that’ll help and it didn’t really
N yea I don’t get the no outside evidence thing
She said if it was a fundamentals class you’d have to do your own research but not first sages?? Doesn’t make sense to me
Oh ic
Still gonna butcher it tgo
which my ex girlfriend tried to convince me was wrong but w/e
-Ur wrong. 
-It’s my last name?
-Yea but ur wrong
That’s so sad and funny
Ye, french v slav dont work like that
Since I’m not the only one having these same issues
Oh god don’t get me restarted on that
Which if I write it the way I want to, probs not
"poor kids are just as smart as white kids"
you're missing an e there, son
Fair enough
Well the final has to be 7-9 but draft is 6-7, so I’m trying to submit at least 7 pages for first draft
"too many animals, no social distancing bad; too many antibiotics makes bad bacteria."
Antibiotics are good, overrelining on them is bad
I’m happy that I have a lot of stuff to talk about, it’s just that it doesn’t follow the subject she wants me to keep to
BYE DON
I miss bag pickles tho

Because Ron isn’t working

So if anyone wants to put a Santa hat on this for me
aidan which traffic light
which seems
stupid
isn't it hazardous tho
but i'm not a traffic engineer

which i realize you know i'm just walking myself through my thought process i guess
Fucking

Lonely pizza on table, cousin, October 2020
Can’t believe she’s showing off her pizza when I ate my last slice yesterday
Now I want pizza smh
Oh I forgot that place exists
My parents gave me grubhub gift card but idk what to use it on
Bruh it’s starting to get colder already
Rascal House is nothing short of a laxative and emetic rolled into one horrible greasy slab
Zach I know nothing of shame
Y'all remember that guy who left due to admin abuse

Sad to hear it
@chandachan idk which one that is, but idk which one any of them are
There’s someone named Olivia
olivia is the worst name there is
But Olive tho
I HATE PEPPERS
disgusting and on pizza or in a salad they're unforgivable
funny enough the only way i can stomach a pepper is to eat it plain
OMG FOOD
It isn't shared at all
israeli nationalism is a sick ticket
at this point if opposing zionism gets you slapped the label of anti semite, what can you possibly say? people shouldn't be afraid of speaking up against injustice because it may make them look bad
IM want you to go as Borat
i've never been to Kazakhstan but u might wanna talk to my grandfather
are you serious
but he's dead so youll need a ouija board
So you need an undetermined amount of peppers and tomatoes
zhanda ur seriously pissing me off and i dont find your shit funny okay
i said not to say it and you do it anyway cause you can't help yourself
It’s in deleted chat still tho
Yea but you should’ve never said that shit in the first place
Some other shit

Well I still need to b close to campus
Isn’t village suites?

Lol that’s what you were originally supposed to do
Hate men
I will never understand why roommates/suitemates are somehow the preferred living situation
i guess some people want to make friends
money
Horrible
but what if, and this is very likely, your suitemates suck and you dont wanna talk to them
But that money u save
mine are gonna think im weird and creepy
just bc im weird and creepy
I’d need hand in marriage before non family are allowed to live with me

i mean i can't say its a surprise
if this much sexual harassment/assault happens now, i can't imagine how much happened then
i thought u meant cuz of the blood
cuz the real blood could have rona in it
> cuz the real blood could have rona in it
@howdy_.  nice to say that now it can’t be me

tis the reason for the season
gotta find the mask
I think I’m actually going to have an issue with paper being too long literally What The Fuck
You already have masks tho
from nothing to too much
these kinds of masks tho
There’s something wrong with this paper, there’s some bad vibes going on with this assignment
expect ron cause he can be my bitch
I thought East cle was the poor part of the city

Can’t abandon our baby
pumpkin soup tho

Ur talking to the person who values babies over literally everything else Raunak, wrong choice
> Ur talking to the person who values babies over literally everything else Raunak, wrong choice
@mootdoot well im a baby too
I think if you were to ask Taplin buds they’d allow you to borrow supplies if you really wanted to
I have mini pumpkin pie left, only for emergencies
but i'm bad at making pie
nvm it's sold out either way
fair enough
Throat test do be easier
Oh
I thought they put a stick in your throat
No that’s for strep throat
Hate that project with a Passion
Didn’t see any Ron
Then didn’t
Oh
I turned off my camera Bc I had to do laundry lol
Do you remember what I told you regarding rain?
Oh
Yes do that for cold whether
It’ll work
Jenin stop taking sides with Priyanka
Go away
Raunak is still a little kid? Shocker
I didn’t say that...
Oh
> I didn’t say that...
@sprinkles2108  huh ?
Nah no need to waste our energy
I’m already so sleepy
Don’t you get it?
Who is this error 404 person im worried

:XMARK6: **I have to rearrange my life**, you can't use that.
> Can the mods ban this user I don’t think they go to case

I want to bonk everyone who broke social distancing guidelines
This world needs a huge BONK
OH

I rlly need to buy cayenne
Milk is fucking disgusting
> you would think indian spice would b spicy smh
@howdy_.  it is idk wtf that restaurant did
Cause they don’t give enough spices to non Indians
This was a phone order so I doubt they got me
I usually go to Indian restaurants for the spice  I’m not able to get away from home
cuz its cider weather
I don’t have any rn
Aren’t ciders alcoholic?
Oh
smh my head
I got apple cider from shaker square market like a month ago
I mean Brandon apparently went to the farm so they’re still open
*i litterly type so our ours till i realized something didnt make sense there*
Can’t wait to not leave my room for 2 weeks
I have a 2 degree separation from someone at OSU
damn
i dunno how effective it is as ppl will sneak across if they really desperate
Yea Wisconsin has rlly been annoying abt that
rip
Ugh now I gotta figure out this quarantine thing smh
i fell asleep and i almost called 911 in my dream bc i couldnt find my way out of a store
me opening my last bag of takis b like

Idk I needed some just now and I kept pulling out already used and I swear I didn’t use all of them
> raunak i hope u have nothing but violent nightmares forever
@2waynice  no u

why dont u get a heated blanket and solve problem 5ever
Well heat packs are only when I’m sick
ron if u b sick, u best not be going to work :banhammer:
Not that kind of sick lol
The way I always have to clarify that around flu season
what kind of sick then
Pain sick
oxygen be killing everyone smh
Well my issue is that I don’t have enough oxygen
Go to the immortal plane earlier u mean
> Well my issue is that I don’t have enough oxygen
@mootdoot  just breathe smh
The air cant hurt you without consent
My foot on ur neck isn’t stopping u from breathing, ur just not thinking hard enough
Time for me to roll up and say my shit
Need to type paper but wrist hurty smh
That’s my last resort
I’ll give it an hour if not guess I’ll die 🤷🏾‍♂️
didnt know they laid eggs
never thought of it b4
:XMARK6: **error 404**, you can't use that.
Someone ban
my parents went and got ice cream without me wtffff 😥
How rude smh just because I’m not home doesn’t mean they can do things without me
Step 1: Don’t look at serving size 
Step 2: :Stonks:
I think it’s a combination of American grandparents making food and stuff I left in the freezer like popsicles
cuz pie tasty
fresh pie tho
Omg I wanna make another Turkey
Ugh I miss hand turkeys in kindergarten
Omg plz
you do realize you guys aren't coming back after thanksgiving right?
Home hand turkey
since when did christmas season start in September?
tis a shame
they still had halloween candy tho
I need to buy a bag for my Taplin bud bucket
i couldn't have that whole box in my room anymore
100grands are mine, they arent everywhere or super popular
I wanted to get a variety of candy but atp it will just be whatever is at rite aid by hecc
not trick or treating this yr sucks tho
stupid rona
I could work if you asked RAs but then if too many ppl wanna do it it’s another hazard
I just opened my computer to continue my paper and there’s like 30 tabs open I cri evertiem
However when she hates the paper I send her that pride will go right out the window
I still haven’t changed my title from peepeepoopoo
I’ve been inspired to actually type the paper but there’s no title inspiration yet
I think I need to b more serious than a punny title
I’m typing this paper knowing that her major critique is probably going to be that I didn’t follow her prompt
i really am
most of our sources are supposed to be from class
i have a grand total of 3/15 sources from class
its weird because she said it in class but the assignment doesn't say anything about it
so i have that if she wants to contest it
See Ron I would do the paper but my cats sitting on my lap so I can’t :/
Damn I’m so sorry to hear that, take as much time as u need
Plus I got my ass handed to me on internet mahjong
I haven’t played mahjong in foreverrr
I play physical solitaire so I don’t get booed at how slow I play
card go boing
I always wanted to buy a physical set but never have
This dude is digging his claws into me cause I’m not petting him enough
I’m trying
But she can’t b upset if I broaden it
I feel like that’s the narrowest one tho
For 7 pages tho
I don’t fw pigs we been thru this Dylan
Idk the timings
Didn’t see that
I’m about to sleep
Dylan can you shut yo lame ass up
Nothing but Shit comes out of your mouth
I look away from my phone for 2 Minutes
He started this shit
HOLD UP cut the motherfuckin music.......
Are you fucking serious?
Holy Shit Dylan go back to Kazakhstan
Shit put context into your words then
Fuck American history
I don’t need that shit
Go do some throat singing
Dylan what's your insurance card number in at the pharmacy I need it
Bruh I completely lost track of where I was going with this paper
rip
Need that Aid that is Mutual
All car knowledge is stored in the local auto zone
thats fair
Guys
Don’t get your pumpkins from the market down Euclid:)))
Oh J&L?
The pumpkin that I got was rotten on the inside :))))
Can’t rlly blame that on the market tho if it’s on the inside they wouldn’t have known either
thats a rip tho
Gotta knock on those bad bois
I’m trying to bait myself into finishing this paper so I can play monster prom but now maybe I should just play game
no, dont be me
Well
It’s now carved
But it def won’t be allowed inside my room
Ugh but it’s 5 pages that’s only like, 1-2 pages left
thats how u end up staying up till 3am writing paper
cuz im smurt
wht are his arms negative space but his legs arent
Need space for Light
i want cheap foods
sarah dont be one of those ppl who puts their uber referral code in their twitter bio
thats uber lame
What class
Still have bio notes to complete smh
Actually I’m not burning out anymore
@sprinkles2108 don't remind me of those bio notes... Why do I have to read 5 sections? This is child abuse
Every week has literally been worse than the last and I had midterms 2 weeks ago
One paragraph left
pain
No pain just Paragraphs
fair enough
2months ago?
Worst experience of my life!
The secret is don’t do anything for 2-3 days n hope inspiration strikes to type it out in 8 hours
I don’t think she wants it to b researchy and sciencey
But I got nothing else for her
I think it’d still work
I don’t know I haven’t studied for the ACT in like... 2 years✨
I would’ve taken longer but my meeting with her is Wednesday
Since I’m a nursing student there isn’t much to talk abt except the paper
I’m too burned out to take a course in January rip
yeah that's fair
i feel like i've been at redline this whole semester
during the 2weeks of no school
ur gonna die?
It’s more than 2 weeks tho?
and then jan classes happen
My break starts from thanksgiving, I don’t rlly have much to do for finals
But yes I will b bored enough to want to take a January class
Only if it’s useful tho I’m not going to take a random class I don’t need I’d rather just finish my sudoku book in that case
I may be going to India right after finals for a month but I don’t know yet
We haven’t finalized anything
car go vrrm
Normally I go to see my cousins over Christmas break, but now I’m Stuck at Home
Nah too far to drive
What sucks is
Unless I’m wrong
Nope
Only 2 weeks winter break
Traveling internationally for 2 weeks is stupid
i think normal college winter break is 3week
Don’t we start second semester on 2/1?
i dunno where ppl are getting schedules from
I haven’t gone in 8 years
nothing in there about spring
But I can’t do much when I’m there :((((
Fuck Covid
FUCK COVID
But they fucked up w the subject so it’s hard to find lol
Supposed to b 21 lol
uh oh
I just dont have that email
Woah oh
thats why its longer
And it’s stupid
so once we get back, its 4 months straight
Well for rona it isn’t
You can’t just move stuff around expecting the same impact
But if you think you can put in a break longer than a day and ppl won’t leave ur hella optimistic
Can’t give opportunities for spreading the virus
Considering any single day breaks will be on Monday or Friday for a 3 day weekend...not happening
i dont think they r even doing 3 day weekends
They aren’t
They didn’t this semester
I’m saying that they won’t just give us a single day off on like a Wednesday or smth, wouldn’t make much sense
4 day weeks would be nice tho
Just don’t go to class lmao
Ye Bc a full break usually closes the whole campus, but you can’t do that if students r still on campus
I guess we just have to suffer
a light week would be preferable than nothing
There aren’t many possibilities with the shit going on
And the worst thing is
There’s no end in sight
Because people are stupid af
Supposed to b all bubbled up here
ye, if wednesday was off i'd probably just sleep or end up doing all the hw that classes would 100% assign due to the day off
And that’s important class time lost
yea, for remote students a day off doesnt involve any missed inperson stuff lol
I’d be so mad if they put a day off on a Tuesday when I have clinicals Bc I’d either still have to go or I wouldn’t and would lose that time
It’s a lose lose situation
I wish politics were this easy
but profs aint gonna do that
Right Bc some profs will claim that a 5 page instead of a 8 page paper is lighter
Or will claim that their work is too important to lighten
sorry drew, but gen ed chem is not important
But tbf some classes can’t afford to give light work
after the class i will promptly forget anything that was said, even thought i've learned nothing suchfar
well we're already behind
Cs majors if you want a big shot at the job industry post-grad... I recommend doing AI research
The CS prof who tweeted that says that PhD applicants will have a much better chance if they want to study another subfield of math/CS
AI is actually fucking impossible to get a job in
everyone wants an AI job
I want a job in no job
Update: I didn’t have corona
Just shuttles not moving
With my eyes closed
Sick flex
My chess board do be ugly tho
It’s bc u didn’t use scratch
You don't have to do the colors
Oh
Bro I haven’t even started
Bruh you better start I spent the whole weekend and I when I mean the whole weekend I mean 12 hours a day and I'm STILL not finished
Shit
We have our own battles rip
Literally haven't started module 10 yet because of this project
> some classes should not be 3 credit
@mag3is  math 126 is 4 credits for me and it’s the one class I don’t pay an ounce of attention to. Then there’s cs classes smh
> Literally haven't started module 10 yet because of this project
@nobelium19  bruhhhh we have to annotate 5 sections
But I don’t think they’re terribly long
But still 5 sections
When’s the project due @nobelium19 ?
The professor said at the beginning that the class is technically 3 credit-hours but might feel more like 5-credit hours without prior coding experience
Sorry I didn't see your messages I was busy trying to do pawn promotion
It's due this friday
If it makes you feel better I’ve been v unproductive today
OMG
Ahh shit I have to start this project tomorrow
Fml
I’m honestly sick of college
Now i have another assignment that I’m working on
Sigh
Thing is I don’t even know if in-person college is better or worse
> Thing is I don’t even know if in-person college is better or worse
@sprinkles2108  well you’ll not know for another year
Raunak I’m calling it now you’ll be stuck in your dorm room all day
I’ll not be stuck
You’ll be stuck in your home
There’s like 10 people cause of rona
That doesn’t make sense
The mattress ain’t comfy
You can’t switch mattresses
Imma burn that shit up
then you're gonna lose your good mattress at years end
Dear Priyanka,
Why don’t you get lost?
it's stupid though
> Dear Priyanka,
> Why don’t you get lost?
@raunakwastaken  I already am lost👁👄👁
Go away
I don’t even know Ron
Your argument doesn’t make sense
There wasn’t
I need to get back to work
LAST CHEM LABBBBBB
Work isn’t real
but i havent seen a tv in months
My thoughts would be shooting, bu i didnt hear any shots
but i do just hate cleveland
It was apparently a phone
oh a theft
too many synonyms in english language smh
Ye, someones phone got yoinked
bc that armed robbery guess spread fast
But sucks for the dude
Fair
Howd they call tho :thonk:
weapon is pretty scary
we dont even kno it was phone tho
rona rlly messed up the monies thing, i havent carried cash since march
i dont even go out with a wallet lol rona rlly fucked up everything all i have on me is id
Hope y’all aren’t near
we were close enough
It was near campus me thinks
i thought we were already north
Oh
only need euclid
but thats far enough away
bc i hate shitty candies
Wtf
I just lost brain cells
smh my head
I’m disappointed in Ron right now
nothing beats a hersheys cookies and cream
best of the worst
its just a ranking of bad candies
So you just hate candy
fucking go crazy for some sugar
Liking sugar doesn’t make you horny though 👁👄👁
oh priyanka
OH
omg
riteaid sounds like sth both holy and bad
~~costco is on another level though~~
one thing you couldnt support
Nope
But its not tho
theres nothing in it but sugar, so its shitty for every reason except for making the brain happy
Smh my head
no value to candy except for making the brain light up
ukno how ppl hate ppl who bite kitkats?
omg ron
i dont have the time to pull those mfs apart
ugh
ive been in horny jail for how long now?
there should b nothing left
Ron do you still have the horny?
no im still Horning
So you still belong there
i want to go to prison
bc the costco salsa is fucking Sweeet
I really need to come back with cayenne
Thats probs why they dont do takis, too hot for many
And why they didn’t have cayenne smh
Im surprised they didnt tbh, its not like its an uncommon spice
i just realized that if hvz is from 3pm to 3am then i cant play in my real prime hours
Those hours are annoying, 3pm too late start
And 3am too early end
this whole week im doing shit til 5 and then after that i should probably study
Rip
Rip
if anyone wants their face put into a 3d program I figured out how to do it
But aren’t our faces already 3D irl👁👄👁
I wish I knew that they were already 3d before spending a few hours on this
look at that crispy clean topology though
if you have pics of multiple angles of her face I might be able to get it in and retopologized
Mannnn I wish I could join :(
I have work that I procrastinated that I need to do :(
rip
I'm bad at animation, but I'm comedically bad at it
*i suggest that rhythm gets defeaned
dunno why but
it's not reassuring that a bot is undeafened
again, dunno why*
yeah I have internet
idk why I can't rtc connect
that picture is scary beyond comprehension
damn
holy shit
> NO
@sar.hh delete this shit
idk how much of this monstrosity can be covered up with her hair
I tried my best with the hair
dw gents, for the essay due today i managed to  double the word count
I've done so much work today
Have a good lunch, work in 90 minute blocks, and I also cycle work between blocks
Like today I did a solid 10 hours of work, by cycling lab, German, Pchem, English, Lab
I wish I could be productive :/
for some reason it takes a minute a frame to render, idk why
Just had a nightmare that I went outside without wearing a mask
Couldn't be me
couldn't be me either
see here raunak
some of us have not studied
in order not to screw ourselves in several hours
we study now
It took 3 alarms for me to finally wake up (without going back to sleep)
Dang it I’m so tempted to go back to sleep
That used to me omg
Idk what happened but sometimes during senior year I managed to wake up to my first alarm and actually stay up
I used to be able to wake up with just one alarm
*don’t worry guys I’m still v thankful to be able to attend college*
I committed myself to figuring out my natural sleep schedule last year and now I know if I go to sleep between 10-11 I can consistently wake up at 7
So that means I can go to sleep around 1am and still make it to classes
Lol same but I’ve given up on trying to sleep at a reasonable time
But I have work to do :(
Rip
If not for work smh I could do whatever on Thursdays
I feel
Thursday’s I have a math quiz rip
And I don’t even pay attention
And I have to chuck my phone at the other side of the room
I just have an inability to wake up and gets worse in the wintertime when my bed is more comfy
i forgot to add the unit
no partial on tests cuz its all multi choice
*cuz the TA's are out to screw us*
see we have partial credit cuz our math quizzes and exams are all free response
jk jk, they just lazy and dont want to grade
Can someone teach me how to divide
50 minutes aint enough
work
we never learned to  type chemistry smh
forever thankful i didnt major in bme
youre not wrong pre med is rough
Now in have math quiz
math suc
How exactly are we supposed to draw the graph freehand?
Sigh
At this point I’m just hoping he doesn’t tell us to draw
Cause I can’t draw
cuz I can bs a drawing
i cant math tho
Math is bad and if you like it you're a freak
i like math everything works logically
> And answers are usually 0,1,2 or 3
@raunakwastaken  I’m really scared of hard le hospitals
i felt betrayed that i learned it right at the end of AB tho
My lines won’t look like the function curve
Seems like Drew brought the hammer down recently
Seems like ~~Drew~~ Big Jimmy brought the hammer down recently
Seems like ~~Drew Big Jimmy~~Chris  brought the hammer down recently
our full class lecture is tn and we are supposed to have read 5 sections by then
is he tellign his TAs to do some actual work?
Apparently Drew runs his TAs into the ground
ngl i salute the TA's of the big introductory courses like bio, chem, math, etc
i mean, multiple choice rlly do b hard to grade, esp w/ no partial cred
i hate mc in general
Butler didn’t ask us to draw the graph 😌😌
Yeah he didn’t:)))))
I hope he won’t decide he “did”
He’s not that type of person
Sigh
I also didn’t know if he wanted the decimal of it
I forgot for a sec that we just had a chem quiz :)))
Looks like everyone has decimals except for me
Failure go brrrr
wanna know what's worse than decimals
It’s scary and I don’t love it LMAO
i no longer mind it
but the worst feeling is forgetting to track them
Oh noooo bahaha
then i was like phew this ain't chem
nope not anymore
IM SORRY :(((
Nuuu don’t be sorry
realized that after my first bio exam
Couldn’t be me
his lectures aren't enough
Raunak and I can’t relate
idk why rmp says otherwise
We also have among us game in chem except drew is always the imposter and the crew mates are my tests and he’s killing them one by one and I can’t report
> We also have among us game in chem except drew is always the imposter and the crew mates are my tests and he’s killing them one by one and I can’t report
@raunakwastaken f
except
and now its gone again
i gotta find it
Case didn’t send me shit
It’s the most awful  piece of cloth in my house
BUT I FOUND MY HOODIE IDK WHERE IT IS NOW
nah you're smart it won't drop
@raunakwastaken If you're stuck, I can give you some guidelines
college during a pandemic ain't it
College ain’t it
I just realized that I called myself "not smart" LOL
> I just realized that I called myself "not smart" LOL
@nobelium19 LMAOOO
I told myself I would run every morning but that went out the window like 3rd week of classes
Atleast you ran for 2 weeks
Bruh I spent entire night up to ~6:40am doing sociology and didn't even touch bio, slept for 20 minutes and back at it again
how many credits are you taking this sem
oh same
i think im taking sociology next sem or maybe a 200-300 psych course idk
Ah shit I also need a non engineering class
Idk which one
idk if i'll get to take stats next sem since they fill up quick
So have a non engineering class as a backup
oh
except
dont they pick sages for us?
It's been like half a year
Idk
OH LIT
Idk tho
So if I don’t get one next sem
I have to take some shit non engineering class
Do you need to take that for CS?
idk
I hate every subject that isn’t engineering. I’m an engineering elitist 😌
Sigh
Computer Science Engineering?
There isn’t a major like that
Idk
they aren't engineering
and some humanities courses are hard
It’s atleast considered tho
idk about cwru tho
i only have AP experience rip
Although you can move the knight moves into the knight, I believe the only ones you need to do are the Diagonal and Straight moves
The 6 pieces + ChessPiece are necessary tho, I would start with that
dr java seems to work
i dont know how to use more than 1/2 of it
But once it gets upwards to 10 files it's painfully slow
rip
Bruh sometimes when I compile and there's an error or something it just glitches out my whole screen and I can't do anything except restart my computer
Nobelium don’t you have a lot of extra classes?
i doubt it. i didn't take notes on them
yeah i have a chem si at 5:30 plus i'm in meetings until 5:30 so thats a fat rip
I'm not pulling an all nighter tho this time
I still have to do module 10 for Java and the prelab due tomorrow smh
for an intro class
But I finished it already so I'm not switching anymore
I've completed most of the functionality of the pieces but I haven't created EuropeanChess or the main method yet
I also haven't done a lot of testing yet
Oh
I feel really far behind seeing some people finished with everything already and since there are only 3 days left
I didn't do any testing for Project 2 until several  hours before the deadline and somehow still eked out an A on testing for that project (testing document was more than 250 lines long)
I still don't have my Project 1 correctness grade, let alone Project 2 correctness or style
That’s better than nothing I feel like
no one talked until nisha stopped by
i was the only one who turned on their camera
i want in person stuff back asap
Couldn’t be me
The only class that I'm taking that even has SI sessions is CHEM 111
i go to si sessions cuz i not smort
Yeah that sucks
Just crash our SI sessions when you’re in med school if they’re still gonna be on zoom
I feel that this rule
nope!
Rip.
omg
I mean they wanna work in the medical field
Oh
Would I remain anonymous though?
idk i've never reported anyone
But also what the fuck is wrong with people
Oh gotcha
Nope. It’s an SI
But also if you don't know what building they're in
But would it not b better to do all the nasty work for next week now so that Friday-Sunday I can truly b brainded?
i swear this class has gone from 25 to 1000 in like 2 seconds
> i swear this class has gone from 25 to 1000 in like 2 seconds
@howdy_. every class this semester really
fuck java
and im not even a cs major
we somehow need to figure out how to code 2 different versions of chess within like a week
just told, hey, you should know how to do this even tho we didnt teach ya
rip
when we don't even have the notoriety for it
and this is due friday?
meanwhile i'm over here dying in bio
ive accepted my stupidity in that class
if i cant even handle bio id fail cs
cwru cs isn't that hard compared to some schools
> if i cant even handle bio id fail cs
@sprinkles2108  not me finding out that the multiple choice was actually out of 70 for me so 🙂
i thought it was either 50 or 60?
they do that here too zach, just not for this class
oh
I think I missed all the points on the table tho
oh really? I was not aware
> cwru cs isn't that hard compared to some schools
@zacharious lmao Carnegie Mellon
Cases cs program 🤝 cases nursing program 
Hard for no reason or notoriety
> I think I missed all the points on the table tho
@anjalir519 maybe try appealing?
oh damn did i luck out by skipping csds 132?
seems like it
Oh no I just mean that I wrote the right answer somewhere but I wrote more so canvas counted it wrong probably
> Oh no I just mean that I wrote the right answer somewhere but I wrote more so canvas counted it wrong probably
@anjalir519 thats what i meant. you should appeal if it marked you wrong
Oh yeah fs I think they’re hand grading that one tho hopefully
HE DIDNT DO ANYTHING
HE WAS ACTUALLY WRONG
this why we need to appeal!
Yeah lmao I think that’s the one I got graded and I missed a point
i probably lost all points on it i wrote sm but idk
i didn't
Rip
idk
It’s weird tho he didn’t discuss it a lot in class
imagine getting the hard frqs 😎
They kinda suck ngl
Which is a mega cringe class
Don't go over 19
19 is enough pain
> imagine getting the hard frqs 😎
@Deleted User which ones did you get
So if I plan to take around 17 credits in the spring, I probably can't take a 3 week class then. I'm okay with that because the 3 week classes look underwhelming
cuz if so then we had the exact same frq's
wtf
i messed up the pku one cuz im not attentive
but honestly idk
i talked about how they showed up more cuz they coupled with ribosomal proteins
but idk
im prob wrong
he didn't
he actually initially got it wrong
like wtf
i didnt come to study bio so i can learn about history
i'm def gonna appeal that one if i got it wrong
i cant remember if i got them right
fax tho
guys im so scared still
watch me not tho
And that feels off for some reason
But I can’t find a different weight on the syllabus
Even if I did miss a few questions
i think i missed one on each
yeah i missed one on the 1st one def
i kinda got lost
I definitely got lost
dying and anxious hbu
> dying and anxious hbu
@sprinkles2108 bio rlly got us all like this smh
imma cry
ok like honestly wtf even is sages
i’m learning what college is for
im too tired for sage
Imagine having a sages class in the early morning
I don’t have any classes before 9pm any day and I live for it
i do and i hate it
merry early christmas
@Deleted Userwait aren't you 3 hours behind?
Oh my god that must be terrible
i'd die
mad respect for yall
i could never
I honestly just wake up at 4:55 and walk to my laptop
i mean compared to my hs 8 am aint bad
wtf
I couldn’t even wake up at 7:20 when I was in HS HAHA
nah rn my hs is doing hybrid and they still start at 7:02
seems like a fantasy now
imagine being in the same room as multiple people without masks and staying apart
rip their ACT's and SAT's
At least some colleges aren’t requiring it for this admissions cycle
i hate tests anyway
haven't
215 yet
really?
no clue, he didn’t say
i really can't afford to do bad
ugh
same I don’t wanna do a post bacc
honestly if i kept my grade rn as my final grade i'd be happy :)))))) but we still have 2 exams and hw and simbios so
and the extra credit doesnt help much
but im still gonna do it
my stats class only has 200 points in so far
ugH alright this stress is legit killing me I’m just gonna try to sleep so I can get my mind off of it, gn all!
idk man i'm tryna survive bio and chem rn
college classes online aint it
In my Cornville hometown it is apparently just like the pandemic doesn't exist anymore so it's full in person,masks technically required but not really enforced, kids sharing tables
Also, 215 the normal way is hard as shit, easy af online
She apparently gave tf up when she had to do it online so it's just watch and regurgitatile. See normally it was attendance mandatory, no phones or laptops allowed, 100 slides per week, if she sees your phone you lose 1% off your final grade for the semester
idk if i'll make it to 215 :')
damn
holy crap
man if 214 were in person rn id be dead
tho
the online exams are way harder
but ig i did say id be dead in normal 214
oh gosh
Online 216 with Benard is Fun, hard, and useful, Online 216 with Kumerle is boring, hard, and mindnumbing
Or you can take it in spring of freshman if you really want
*oh*
It doesn't look like what I took at all
i cant even
and expects to get into med school
you also don't have mod powers here
I don't in that chat either, it was just a gentlemen's understanding
Zhanda cant be right
Don't you have school work to do
Its horrible for your brain chemistry
Idk how anything you learned before like 3 hours ago is going to crystallize
> Don't you have school work to do
@toomanyzs It's his $70,000, not yours
we haven't played a game in a while
jeez I haven't played multiplayer napoleon in ages
But I'm trying to find a sale where I can get all the DLC without purchasing them individually
though even ck2 I prefer multiplayer since singleplayer is too easy
only my math class has regular tests though
It’s her fault for not having the canvas test block me when I tried to start the test
Idk abt sus or nah
Just need my grade
it really is since its changing your registry
Ayyy she didn’t mind
U want fruit snacc
U actually want one
do u hav work
they work there
Yes they work so hard
i don’t think so
but a dog cafe would be so much work i think
Dogs don’t bite but some owners do
takis bad
i cant believe this man rn
you just cant handle the truth
i guess not😔
*and if you still cant handle them, i can make them disappear for ya :P*
im surprised tbh there isnt a case food review group
it seems like a no brainer
bye bye
Shoutout to whoever put out Kit Kat darks at work
Half an hour left for my prelab and drjava stopped working 😌😌
I hear this shit from every writing teacher I have when will it b Enough
Gosh that’s a bad definition hold on
Isn’t it just 2?
And for the cooking assignment that was due yesterday
Cause canvas is showing me “not submitted”
he's still going
Ate sandwich super fast to turn on camera for class
Now stomach hurts :cocoyyell:
FUCK
my last project didnt compile
i knew i should've just left that method blank
instead i added a bunch of crap to see if i could get partial credit
I hate this classs
oh be really careful about that in future comp sci classes. Some of the programming assignments in data structures are autograded and if the program can't run your code, you will prolly fail the assignment
can someone update it this weekend?
i still see 223
This 2 month break...don’t see how I wont lose all my brain cells
How the *fuck* are there over 200 slides for my biology classes next chapter
I’m stupid ignore me✨
Hey stupid ignore me ✨
Oh!!
She had the school of medicine role so I thought she was
Never
i don't find the buttom
We can’t add yet
You can’t before November
we're last on the totem pole
sorry
Cant stop the party Michael
same tho
Also gross I’m so scared he’s actually gonna use some of these mc
SOMEONE VIRTUALLY YELL AT ME TO GET BACK TO WORK
It’s like such a bader thing to do tho
Lmaooo I know I need study motivation
I LITERALLY CANT WITH MYSELF
Like I legit wish I could study with people because they just hold me accountable
STOP OVERTHINKING YOUR LIFE EVEN THO ITS IN SHAMBLES
UGH
UGH
I went on the pets page and now I can’t be productive for the next 2 hours
aight imma head out
regret, my old friend... or at least he would be if I didn't refuse to regret shit in my life
Is anyone in bio awake rn
Tim Misnys son went to my old school and I used to see him all the time picking up his kid
@sprinkles2108 I was but I didn't see your message sorry
I swear I've gotten average 2 hours of sleep this week, I need a break
> @sprinkles2108 I was but I didn't see your message sorry
@nobelium19  oh dw at all you’ve got a whole comp sci project to worry about
> I swear I've gotten average 2 hours of sleep this week, I need a break
@nobelium19  I think everyone felt this
Did I really just ping myself smh
> @sprinkles2108 Bruh everytime I'm awake you're also awake, what's up with that
@nobelium19  pain.
The first half of the semester wasn’t bad then all of a sudden it got bad
can never be as iconic as Barbara Snyder
Why do I feel an attachment to Barbara even though I've been here for literally 2 months
I haven't slept for less than 8 hours this entire semester
i need 8 hours or i die
> I swear I've gotten average 2 hours of sleep this week, I need a break
@nobelium19 CS project?
Its such a pain
I will finish it today tho
You could’ve used mine or Sarah’s 😡😡😡
Not me, wrong bitch💅🏼
Sarah isn't either
She tried to take my phone 😡
I'm sorry ben
She doesn’t understand our love Adam 😡
Do you need my to bully her
Over your head?
Nature valley bars are a drug tho
I can’t believe Ben is encouraging drug addiction
fair
Zhanda you don't need to let the whole world know that you go to the den at 11:06 pm every night to get chicken tendies
i dont even eat at the den
i want bibibop
i don't
why do you think i haven't eaten there since march?
which i don't think it is
Worse than panda
i'm still at home
i doubt jolly's open either
Never had bibibop tho
especially cause you can get everything under the sun and it still tastes hella good
so you save money
or i guess get more for your dollar
Can confirm it’s good shit
Did you use code howdy tho
smh my head
Already have rewards account tho
i need to be the king of java tho, cuz my chess program is empty af
I don’t eat enough bbp for more accounts
mitchells needs one
whoever that kid is, they're a bad ass
Would I cry if I started with 2 and not 1?
1 is shorter, won't take much time
want you gone?
oh
Still alive
Sorry
still alive is portal 1
7gbs won't take that long
I'm replaying hl2 again, trying to get inspiration for assets for a game I'm building
Man finna hop in the wrong portal
I've never tried it but it looks cool
i just haven't played in fucking yeeeeeeeeeeears
smh the TA has not joined yet
theres a TA in the server?
gets u nothing, but gets me everything
oh, when are those happening
jenin if u want $3 bibibop get the app
Can’t find the app 🥺
dont be seen by turrets
Fuck that level took me so long
I'm mad
-too scared to say hi
this sucks
If I don’t say hi it’s bc I don’t kno u ❤️
if i don’t say hi it’s because i’m so zoned out idk what’s going on in my surroundings
Also now that I have nice headphones, surroundings don’t matter anymore
Like when howdy passed by me while I was waiting for nursing shuttle I vaguely noticed howdy aura but did nothing else
this is so bad to admit
But I get sleepy when I drive 😭
And she’s gonna fucking seize
so I don’t fall asleep
Ben doesn’t wanna drive with me😭
To be fair I deserve it
no u hate julia
omg gater got covid 💀
Apparently a big thing got busted and 2 people had covid in it
shame on them
My building is still perfec
If nobody wants to do it on main, there have been rumors of this like big Juniper party on weekends in the common rooms, and the RAs don't do shit about it
You can DM me if you want to be anon
Or just roast them on here idk
Idk
It wasn't something that was supposed to be happening, that's for sure
none of my kids were involved so I don't really get to *offficially* know
The only athletes I've met in juni were XC, which isn't that big
it doesn't take many mental gymnastics to see how covid procedures go out the window when nobody is watching
im so sleepy
class work so much
that doesnt soun d sociallly d istanet
this was actually released by my hometown's DOH a few weeks ago, I can't stop thinking about it:

https://www.instagram.com/p/CGI_MYVHTyl/
Awww
I don't know if I have annoynced this yet
annoyance away zach
a fuck ton of resources going towards this
It's either that or
ppl have actually gotten worse over the past month
Well CWRU PD is the one who takes ppl to quarantine so if you don't go then you get a *special* quarantine
sleep party where i get more than 8 hours
adam don’t cursed flush me
never heard of it
bed is an illusion made by those who dont take java
no he won’t
which says nothing but ok
don't try us
sarah if you don't check the deleted log your life would suck a lot less
it really would
you’re the source of all my pain and suffering
that and being left on read :vibe:
no, you see that's **my** source of pain and suffering
beck is yelling at me bc i don’t know how to play chess
I didn't know he was real
He isn't a money man
❤️DR. FUCKING. LUCAS.❤️
This means nothing to me
I know someone there toooo
school
But some don't know that Babs actually went to Uchicago Law
They're still digging them up
Corbin went to Harvard and MIT
stanford undergrad is weird af, I have a buddy who goes there
are learning from professors who went to T5s
Then aren't you getting similar educations
honestly, it's kind of scary at times how similar the academic experiences at different colleges are
i should’ve gone to community college
i would have so much money
I should have gone to plumbing school
Community college is not the same
I am already dealing with shit 😎
There’s so many descriptions for shit in medical records
you tried to beat me and ben up
so annoying
how am i the annoying one here
oh
i’m sorry adam i appreciate you
And didn’t even get a retry
I like getting the ping bc it reminds me there’s an update
i think it’s time for me to leave the server fr
no u can’t be trusted adam
no i had 5 shots of espresso today i can’t sleep
If Dylan leaves then u leave then it’s just howdy and he just likes me for taki talk
Coffee scary
but i was shaking and couldn’t take bio notes :vibe:
I almost knocked out in the middle of work, should’ve brought caffeine
I do really like coffee, but it makes me crash too hard
Coffee keeps me awake
I j make my own so idk its content
Haven’t had a coffee in 5 years
I hate the amount of Starbucks I’m getting
I need to drink my own shit
I had those then hated them so I’ve stuck with chai latte
> I hate the amount of Starbucks I’m getting
@mootdoot  I spent $5.25 on a latte the other and I was like 👁👄👁
But ugh it’s so goood
Bc for clinicals and work
I need to use all these flasks n shit I brought and keep my own tea hot smh
Same with bibibop I cringe as somebody snorts covid slobber all over my food while making it from their stupid schnozz poking out
Maybe it’s bc they don’t get as much traffic so they think they can have a break
But don’t get up to the food and then put on mask
I wish she'd given me another sauce jar
Yeah it was announced in 2016 and didn't happen until now
I say that abt a lot of shit tho
@chandachan Have you been to hell's Chicken yet?
I need hella spice
I’ll still try it tho
Oh well I have some Mad Dog 357 hot sauce if you wanna try that
Yeah
We’re missing spice
I’ve already started my list of what I need to buy before I come back and it’s currently just toothbrush and cayenne
i wish
I lowkey wish, bc then I could keep working
But no I’m leaving 😔
But I don’t wanna be alone as well
Actually how does that work??
Dunno
I mean I already said I was leaving but if I can have kitchen to myself then 👀👀
Never
So I can’t keep them
Ughhh I keep saying I’ll go to thwingo but then get so comfortable in my room I don’t wanna leave
Last year when everyone got kicked out suddnely they paid for people to eat at the UH food court
Oh I have gift card for that
I want the J Balvin meal from mcdonald's and I don't even like mcDonald's, I'm just a victim of advertising and catchy Reggaeton beats
because stockpiling might be an issue without one
mcdonald’s is so bad... but it’s SO GOOD
Someone I know is trying to get travis scoot reeses puffs
I haven’t had mcds in foreverrrrrr
Noooo I’m trying to eat my pantry
I have stored stuff that I don’t wanna eat yet
Left for emergencies
Yea I have stuff left for emergencies, but all my emergencies took me out my room so now I have to eat emergency stash
it sucks because constantinos is closed
I have to go so far or buy frozen fruit for my fruit water 😣
But the new place is supposed to open sometime spring 21 I think
I tried J&L but they don’t sell assorted fruit stuff
This will all b solved when I steal parents car
Yes when I steal parents car
The only time I went grocery shopping is when I went to Costco 2 weeks ago
I think I went to target 2 weeks ago
I tried to buy bag of frozen fruit, and it was going to take up half my freezer space
Oh I forgot abt that
But that means I’d have to leave room if I want frozen fruit T^T
Ur on the same floor tho
But I still have to look somewhat presentable to go get itttt
*just don’t bother*
Nice to have just in case you don’t feel like cooking
Idk how joy does it without a meal plan, I wouldn’t b able to do it
Still on cexy Chicago cuarentine list tho 😔
That’s Ohio in general tho
Oh man meal planning, couldn’t b me
Fun fact the 5 counties, and my county, are all in the top 7 of worst cases/100k
Oh chicago is having it bad?
wtf is that
Somehow that's worse
Smh my head autocorrect
Those 2 weeks are going to b annoying, bc I want Food
get a covid test when you get there; CVS is doing drive through testing
Looks like I can’t go to chicago for thanksgiving then
I’m assuming I’ll be doing a test before I leave
Yea I’m upset I’ll b quarantining thru thanksgiving
Problem is
I wanted to go there only for thanksgiving
so get the test and you don't have to quarantine
Don't get out of the car b/w ohio and chi and then don't quarantine
Isn’t the incubation period nearly 2 weeks tho? P sure that’s the whole point of quarantine
*zach interacting with stupid people*
they sent out an email to every person in the compsi class saying someone got rona in the class
i’m actually pissed at this lab report we have to do for bio 👁👄👁
Lol they just want u to kno howdy
Was that person in the Monday class or the Friday one?
Because in theory we walk around getting singular exposures from aerosol but its in such low quantitiy that it doesn't infect
She's epic though
Or die by cop
I wish to die by corn dog
elefun is a memory i forgot i had
i never did real-life swimming
I’ve never played that before
I used to have like magnet fish game tho
It didn’t look like that but I’m sure it’s similar
Don’t break the ice
This bad boi
ahhh i dunno that
i dunno break the ice though
i never actually thought about swimming
cuz i never had access to that type of thing
Emily’s cooking games tho >>>
i don't like being wet
My body hates it but my brain likes it
both my body and brain hate it
When you get like super cold and everything sticks to u
Is veale even open?
going into pools seems sus
ahh i went there today
Uh oh
is it wrong that I know which exact burrito that is?
Never been to del taco
i forgot what chain burrito i ate in texas
haven't been there since I was 7
Fact: piston problems suck sm
what class
Holy shit
I forgot madalorian is starting from today
OMG
I got chem tho in a bit
She just left us
Nope
i think raunak hit the sauce a bit too hard
> what class
@chandachan  chem
Definitely won’t be doing archery on Sunday then lol
I have lost all motivation to finish this project
cuz i need it
My goal is to grind out this chem lab report in 2 hours
Will I? I don’t know
Rip to the original chem lab group chat though
what happened to ur gc?
> I have lost all motivation to finish this project
@raunakwastaken  Same, there's no way that I spend another several hours getting pawn promotion/castling to work just for 2-3 extra points
> what happened to ur gc?
@howdy_. it got deleted somehow. typically the owner has the power to delete but idk if they deleted it intentionally
yeah prob idk
> @raunakwastaken  Same, there's no way that I spend another several hours getting pawn promotion/castling to work just for 2-3 extra points
@_frostyyyyy_  just got pawn promotion and castling to work 😌😌
am i wrong tho
I pulled 2 many all nighters for that class
It's the best cs class after data structures** tho tbh
> with how this ***intro*** class is going
@howdy_. 
You don't like connamachers class?
its fucking terrible
and this class is clearly for those
Never programmed before ever
He answers them tho so props to him
i've tried emailing
Doesn't help he's the only graph theory guy
Idk why tho
isnt junit for testing stuff tho?
Then junit has built in functions you want to use
If you want to drop java like the poopoo language it is
How do you take plc without doing Java first? Isn't java a prereq for plc?
Zhanda you want people to smell your feet??
Wait, did I kink shame you? I’m sorry
> How do you take plc without doing java first? Isn't java a prereq for plc?
@_frostyyyyy_ 
Oh yes it is. I meant after java lol
So you realise just how bad you shld be not learning java lol
A lot of the other CS classes such as data structures are apparently taught using Java
kill me
Hey java ain’t that bad okay
i just asked my dad (who's in IT) if java is bad and he said no confidently
i forgot it lol
oh apparently C# is a bitch
not sure, haven't learned myself
tho
ive never coded java
im not wrong tho
at least i don't think so
> i just asked my dad (who's in IT) if java is bad and he said no confidently
@sprinkles2108  Indian gang
ughhhh i'm SO CLOSE to finishing my chem lab smhhhh
i hate writing the procedure
couldnt be me
nope, quite literally dont
and doesnt mark my code for not being there
atleast i dont have to go 2 work today
ye, unfortunately its being wasted on smol brain over here
its ok im smol brain too. i could never survive cs
*i dropped out of this class last week*
i dont have enough creds to do that
aslong as u didnt delete it
that's tough, im sorry for y'all
python gang goes hard tho
what i would be able to do if the world ran on python
Omg I have to delete
BRUHH RIP
i wish i was in columbus they have good target there
i miss good target
why do i miss easton bro😔 it wasn’t even that good
dunno which one is better tho
same with polaris tho polaris has less ghetto areas
since easton is closer downtown
i remember wanting to have a birthday there SO BAD
i miss the era when i had time to go to the mall
Too broke sowwy
maybe they decided to play chess irl instead of on their computer
holy shit howdy is that ur ghost
Everyone in nursing is just sharing quizlets and crying
honestly I'd rather stay up till 2am instead of wake up for a 7am clinical
Just need some earl gray
when our lab is due at midnight my partner and i are getting insomnia cookies so it's ok
@mootdoot can u throw a reeces at my window, i need sustenance
Don’t have Reese’s u want some mini snickers
Oh
I'm trying
I’m almost done I have a tiny bit of salsa left and pumpkin pie I’m saving for tomorrow
Rip
howdy don't you have a project to finish
like it literly cant
*unless someone gave me code*
tho i need chocolate
U actually want some mini snickers
unless u dont got many
i dunno the smoothie situation tho
Seems like it
but hey, if you don't like the people next to you, and one of them has corona, it appears that EVERYONE in that room will disappear for two weeks
Jenin can't handle her new snitching powers
Do they have candy outside of door?
Not yet
I wonder if anyone has tried to get covid purposefully early on, quarantine for two weeks, and be immune for the rest of the pandemic
Eh but immunity isn’t guaranteed
unfortunately, people have tried that
I mean if people tried it at least a few of them died
I mean wrestling is probably the sport I'd do if I wanted covid
*meanwhile i've never met howdy*
idk about dark chocolate tho
Cuz Halloween 
Never tolerable
OH
Oh I have ghiradelli
ME WANT LE CHOCOLAT
i'm not sleepy yet
I’m sleepy
And jealous
trust me i wanted to cry
but i didnt
~~still have my bio lab report to finish~~
rip
I told him to put his hands in his pockets when he went back up the stairs
He said that they're giving them the opportunity to test on Monday and be released
Bruh
U might be sick
And u have to quarantine
And u have to collect your stuff for quarantine
This sucks
~~don't go to football practice with covid~~
Correction: 
~~don't covid~~
oh?

@nobelium19  do it
Honorlock flagging me for staring into space Bc no thoughts head empty
@toomanyzs lol my lab partner has to quarantine and he told be like half the team got exposed because someone came with covid
I was nervous about that my freshman year when it was in-person, I sat next to nobody, and I didn't even look up the entire time. I don't know why. I'm an honest bean.
Freshman year Drew recorded us during our exams and my anxiety shot up even though I never cheated✌️😅
I don't really know why being recorded causes a different reaction for me in different settings
i WANT WENDYS
I want Wendy's
Zach you are.literally a stone's throw away from the den
Oh yeah I forgot
Oh
And their fries ain’t bad either
Idk if I’ve ever had Arby’s🤭
Ugh Wendy’s sounds good rn
rip
oh shit
dont remind me that exists
sigh
its gonna go up in like 8 hours
I see roman got tired of being a rodestroyer
He wasn’t just *a* rodestroyer
ugh
Who doesn’t want to do donuts at 2:30
oh damn it be 4:30 for yall
go to sleep
Tomorrow apparently
I recommend everyone clean their photo libraries
I just cut my meme folder in half
Because it’s a lot of jokes that i can’t tell anymore 😔
Also I don’t use memes as much as I used to
Don’t need 500 of them
I already pay 99¢/month for cloud storage
For my phone
I use neither onedrive or gdrive for anything that isn’t schoolwork
I refuse to download any extra apps on my phone
Oh gosh
I have one 64gb usb drive for entertainment purposes when I don’t have wifi
ohh, i got a usb w/ the entire first season of cosmos on there, i need to add some more stuff to it eventully
i turned my other usb into an autorun desktop goose
which means i cant use it for much else
Oof idr I haven’t updated it in like a year
I haven’t needed to use it in a minute but now that I’m thinking about it lemme start downloading a bunch of shit on it lol
huh, i've never like rewatched something that isnt like a music video or a meme
once i've watched it it never appears again
i didnt know ppl save their yt for later vewing
Most of the stuff on this drive is comedic Bc I use it most when I’m sick
but it was like so wrong and just static aswell
And 我饿了Bc bitches b hungry
Can’t say I’ve heard of it
I’m giving up on this downloading stuff, i do not have the patience rip
I don’t watch dramas
The only reason I watched the one he was in was bc I wanted to know what his acting was like
case has gigabit, it shouldnt take that long ()_()
smh my head
I just did not understand at all what I was supposed to do lol
Stupid rona I could have faster download speeds :banhammer:
Where does one find the form?
I’m on the website and I don’t see shit
@kaori_flute @sprinkles2108 @ctw1591 sorry for leaving so abruptly, I had to haul ass to mitchell's for an event lol
i would never meet jenin
don’t know her! only could recognize her if she was playing the flute
is it just me or are the meal plans super overpriced
College is over priced
Considering I haven’t eaten a dining hall meal in weeks
I mean if you’re going out to eat everyday, that’s not bad
@beckck im veg too. what kinda food are you able to eat there? im trying to decide if i should do the plan or just buy my food from the grocery store
really
bc they don’t want kids coming and starving
Also they don’t wanna b blame for starvation
but theres like a bus to a grocery store
and they need enough of a baseline so they can offer it at all
Honestly idk why they don’t tell prospies that all the meal options are on their website, saves a lot of questions
Wish I had known they had a website for it all before I got on campus, would’ve brought less snacks
Oh shit they have tofu???
Don’t get tofu from leutner
damn what
not the worst
but theres seriously a lot of food options around here, if youre willing to walk some days you wont get bored
im a vegetarian and i just have shit taste in food so
i cant eat like 95% of things
I think you can’t go wrong with bibibop tho, it’s just rice bowls
fuck why cant i just not get the meal plan
if i just say i have very strick dietary needs
Worst case scenario for them is a student doesn’t do meal plan then runs out of real money and then has no options for food
theyre not that bad
No, dining halls take dietary needs seriously
@raunakwastaken i have more specific dietary needs tho
oh gotcha
i dont like to be rly picky to people making me food bc
I mean same but, they won’t let you go lol
lol i cant cook my own food
ig its my parents money not mine 🤷‍♂️
I did meal plan and I can’t really use it so it’s wasted yea
its 3k tho
i wouldnt rly care if it wasnt 3000 fucking dollars
yo i have a feeling that rona is bad
Pumpkin cookie bomb tho
Don’t need the insurance I think
yeah i dont need it but
esp since you dont hae a roommate
If ur shit burns then rip ig
i looked at the plan, it doesnt cover alot of things
Never kno
but if you are it wont be covered anyway
its 2020 so you never know
i will leave the faucet on but plus the drain
if my room burns to a crisp rn the only real loss is my laptop, everything else here i also have at home like clothes and food so insurance is a meh idea
cant trust roomates
pluss, what else would u need to be scared of
today i have nothing to do, and im so bored that im actually doing work for next week
u got games tho
I tried slime rancher for 30 minutes then got tired from all the cuteness
Just gonna do work for an hour then play game again probably
atleast since ur doing the work now
you dont have to do it later
Maybe I’ll spend like 4 hours in the museum tomorrow since I have nothing to do lol
i've never not seen aviable slots
Yea I did that but it doesn’t say if I have to leave after a certain amount of time??
mine didnt last i went
tho, i've never seen them not have aviable slots for getting in
I did mine like on Tuesday because I was worried
that just doesnt exist over here
Nothing will beat the art exhibit I went to in like March this year
And it was very unconventional he just put shit wherever he wanted
aw
Yea it was crazy because he’d put some super old traditionally western portrait next to like, a self 3d sculpture from an art student who got upset at some point and bashed her own fake head in
> student who got upset at some point and bashed her own ~~fake~~ head in
damn
Wish I bought the art book though
I went literally right before shit hit the fan from rona
rona do be sucks, i was going to meet w/ some ppl i havent seen face 2 face and then rona was like
rip, it only exists in ur memories
And my memories shit lol
tho i for here, i think they dont like flash photos
i dunno i've never left the country
In the book he was like “I’m tired of art snob curators telling us how things should be grouped, do it however u want “
Hates the idea that you have to spend millions of dollars to b called an art collector
well its cuz you dont
this is fair
there are some ppl who really lean into that tho
Aw man ppl who renovate are insane
I don’t have patience or money to reorganize spaces into something else
oh ye, u mentioned he was a fashion designer
I was talking w/ some ppl @ rit, and they just stopped letting ppl freely go from dorm to dorm
I mean we can’t really go from dorm to dorm either
i wouldnt want to turn down that hallway in the middle of the night
we havent been able since that start
they just stopped that now
Dang yea a lot of College Experiences we’re missing out on
fair
I really wanted to buy fudge smh
yea, some of the shops were closed down
when we went the fudge stall was open
they must have closed then qq
I would go back, but seeing so many people without masks by that mitchells spooked me
but kinda hard to do that on a campus
If only my friends didn’t have other friends :banhammer:
dont have friends, and you neverneed a mask <o/
its working so far 4 me
On campus you can’t even visit other ppls rooms anyway
Or at least ur not supposed to :banhammer:
Which is sad Bc we cannot
theres a bunch of different ways to make rice tho
I’m trying to take the rice
sorry ron i had to delete 💀
Yooo I haven’t had rice w butter in like
wtf kind of combo is that
I havent had any since moving into dorms
Big sad
now I want rice and butter smh
My canola car
Hot Sammy is so salty now idk if my tongue has changed or if some keeps sleeping while putting in salt
It’s why I’ve chosen to eat what’s left of a home cooked meal today, I need anti salt today
And not still trash them
Like I already brought containers with me lol I don’t need more
I have a pepperoni roll as todays meal since i no leavy
Same I wanted to stay in all day today
But now am bored
well just say no, boredom cant take you without ur consent
Didnt work
rip
if you want to hop into some portal 2 co-op lmk
I have like 2 more levels left
Yea i thought I could make them shoot each other but they don’t allow that :angery:
*atleast you tried*
bit diff vibe for it tho
@howdy_. don’t put the table tennis emoji to this text
i tried to react
Was nothing in there except beef
Texted mom response is: grandma thought u would b hungry
Of all the things tho, rice, the different sauces, the many sweets that would remind me of home, my grandmother was like “ah yes....beef”
:XMARK6: **bit.ly/CWRUassessment**, you can't use that.
Fuck dollar shave club all my homies hate dollar shave club
They haven't sent me a box I ordered 2 weeks ago so my entire full beard has grown back
I'm going to be in lumberjack territory in another 2 weeks
JULIA I MISSED YOU TODAY 🥺
Ahhh I haven’t had that one, how was it? 🙈
I know I’m sorry😭😭😭😭 I kept falling asleep🥺🥺
we passed by it
When you walk out it's to the immediate left
close to leutner
Near the village buildings
Omg I thought it waa leutner pavilion lolll
Dead by daylight
True tho
theres an everything killer wut
Michael Myers is not as OP as he is in Halloween tho which is icky
Also yo wtf was with Halloween having a full moon today, extra spooky today
alright, what happened to the incel channel?
IM SORRY WHAT😂😂😂
Seems legit
it sucks ik
oh bruh
I don't know if that is general-friendly
> It’s 6:38 now
@kaori_flute are you going to sleep now? No way you woke up this early
Hell yea it’s fucking started
> @kaori_flute are you going to sleep now? No way you woke up this early
@raunakwastaken  huh
Ping
No I woke up then
Went back to sleep though :ThisIsFine:
Oh
Took 10 minutes to find entrance
Actually idk cause I’ve never been to campus
like wtf is that
we can't have pumpkin as the server icon forever
Throw away the pumpkin
i dunno if this has anything to do with it
but
my nitro expires tmw
dunno if this cancels the boost
but at least
change it b4 tmw
And you won’t be able to send the empress emotes
Ope that’ll be too late
ye
so u won't be able to go in vc
> ye
> so u won't be able to go in vc
@kaori_flute  you’re mean
it's raining hard af
It's always raining here lolll
It didn’t rain yesterday though
Did not expect to spend 2 1/2 hours there omg
Only reason I know that is because I couldn’t sleep lmfao
Bruh you're going to wish you had rain once it starts snowing
Apparently I walked past wade oval and stayed on East boulevard and that’s how I got lost
I would much prefer snow because as someone who drives a lot, the rain makes conditions worse than snow oftentimes
Lol what streets do u drive that rain is better than snow
In a neighborhood near cleveland where I drive often to get to CWRU, the sewer systems sucks and everytime a little rain hits the road floods
I drive a big car so I’m not afraid of a little snow, and the snow trucks do a fairly decent job where I live
Oh dang
I drive pathfinder which I think is fairly decent but they dont clean up the snow enough
Oh icky 😦
Oof dunno
I know they have to prioritize which gets cared for but like non main roads need to be cleaned too smh
I see why everyone here boasts abt CMA tho
But oof rip
Snow sux in general tho
All precipitation sucks
like half of the chinese exhibit is either a wooden sculpture or iconography of some bodhisattva
Bruh I went with my parents a couple of weeks ago and they were lecturing me on what each of them were 😆
Didn’t go to any asian exhibitions today
Anyone gone to the botanical garden though? I haven't been there yet
I was there but I didn’t go in
Still bought the book tho lol
My parents went to the CMA but I was with people so🙃
oh rip
Why do I feel more tired with daylight savings
I’m tired because my legs are hella sore
ahh RIP
Me: I need a break

Also me: goes to campus thinking imma “relax”
did u not?
no studying
bruhhh
i already miss yesterday
Bruh imagine, I'm so behind in everything
Couldn't be me
I'm so burned out from last week because of Java
> I'm so burned out from last week because of Java
@nobelium19  dude I was stressed out for you guys
Oh same priyanka
I have another Java project + 2 exams
I did all my work and studying for the next week so I can have this one weekend
chem and math yeet
omg ron teach me
I NEEDED A BREAK SO I GRINDED SO HARD THIS WEEK
Man do I need to plan to come every week to motivate y’all
Yea I really wanted to spend my time at the museum and also not do shit when I got back from it
we need u
Plus there wasn’t much to do
still tho
on campus >>>>>> anything else
> I’m tired because my legs are hella sore
@sprinkles2108 did you not use my trick?
> still tho
> on campus >>>>>> anything else
@kaori_flute  I AGREEEEEEEEEEE I LOVED BEING WITH PEOPLE
AND JUST BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT
i also wanna be on campus soooo bad
If I don’t get to live on campus
I’ll internally cry
@nobelium19 botanical is fun but there isn’t much there, the paths are fun to walk with people tho
Also jenin I forgot to tell you this yesterday
AHHH
YES
U HAVE PWETTY EYE LASHES
ALSO FORGOT TO SAY
You haven’t
i have seen jenin tho
No you haven’t
i havent
kidz dunno how to talk
Omg it's raining again
Damn Ohio
bruh it literally just turned November it's too early
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL MEEEE
october was like 3 mins long
it took you this long to go to mitchells?
> it took you this long to go to mitchells?
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus  I’m a remote student
Rip
imma die
Couldn't be me
*wish
When is it due
I don't have the brain cell(s) to do that
rip
> When is it due
@chandachan  tomorrow
i need it
@howdy_. change the logo i can’t figure out how to do it on my phone 😪
Oh shit it is November lol
See Bc I started my day with all I want for Christmas is u, I just skipped a month
I forgot what the original logo was already
babs is gone
we need a  diff logo
Babs will never leave
Bruh really?
all this past weeks rain would be snow
if global warming didnt say no u
cuz im from columbus
Bruh I don't want to hear about that, and also I don't know who Tyler Joseph is lol
tyler joseph's mom works (idk if she still does) at my school
> Bruh I don't want to hear about that, and also I don't know who Tyler Joseph is lol
@nobelium19 OMG
> Bruh I don't want to hear about that, and also I don't know who Tyler Joseph is lol
@nobelium19 UHHHHHH 21 PILOTS???
You're from Columbus tho
what happened
nobody outside ohio even knows what either of those places are
isnt everything ohio
Sidney, OH
sarah you're not terribly far from cbus tho
nobelium is like nowhere ohio but to the left, i’m nowhere ohio to the right smh
> nobelium is like nowhere ohio but to the left, i’m nowhere ohio to the right smh
@sar.hh Lol where?
Oh I've heard of that place
OH ME TOO
i want her to winnnn
i will say tho
maybe cuz i was p hungry
i wish i could've stayed in cle for dinner tho
couldnt be me
cuz stats would get too hard
its going to be 5cred of work
> i'm gonna take soc in january i think
@sprinkles2108 I'm taking Sociology rn, it's not that hard, just a lot of work for me
Bruh I'm taking 18 credits of work rn, that should be easy claps
Also can't you drop it upwards to midterms for those classes?
You need a 3.2
I don't want to do that much in 1 semester but for spring if I'm taking them separately it should be ok
So if you want to do 3 credits in January and 17 credits February-May then you need a 3.2 and approval from a navigator
Yeah well hopefully, unless I fail Java *knocks on wood* I should have at least a 3.2
Data structures, discrete math, calculus III (preferably in January), econ, SAGES, and maybe another math class
I might take MATH122 again
I wanted to take 281 (Computer Organization) but it's scheduled at the same time as Discrete Math. I don't think that was a good decision as both are core CS classes that have 132 as a prereq
why isn't the logo an animated one???
why has it changed????
The cold
Apparently it snowed here too and I had no idea
Rn I’m too inside to know whether or not it’s snowing again
Obviously there won’t be a white coat
Which is sad
> why isn't the logo an animated one???
> why has it changed????
@kaori_flute because people out here can't accept what real art looks like
Also, just realized after like 10 weeks of clinicals that my scrub bottoms are too short lol
i want her to
Sometimes I don’t think I have long legs
Then I measure my legs and realize that my legs are somehow longer than their tall??
you guys want a thanksgiving themed one?
cameron dont voerwork yourself
Guess who just applied for housing even though she likely won’t get a room🤪
Death on D-day ?
oh
Actually idk what it means that was just me guessing
Dang I knew that wtf
Why didn’t I remember that lol
how am i supposed to participate in nnn when i have xmas babs
Yea I never hide that fact
Seems a bit premature don’t you think
Only been 16ish hours into the month
i forgot it was nnn and i wangjangled
“Forgot”
i didn't say nothing
cuz i be sweating
dont you mean, cwruky
all i want for christmasss is cwruuuuu
don't give in to the flesh
Sometimes SoundCloud cuz ukno
if you don't want ads just use ublock
I need to download my music tho
I do be too broke for premium lmao
That’s so much work
It's not that much work
but there's probably an open source youtube mp3 downloader
I never pirate anything... unless it’s textbooks🤠
I know there was a video downloader on github that got dmca'd, but the code is still floating about
But for music I don’t have that much caring
You have a sad life then
Smh my head
they don't have a right to display ads on your machine
But I don’t feel like learning a whole new interface
Aw ew I don’t like playlists
Does Spotify not have a library tho?
it does. i don't use it
Dunno if there a way to check how many songs I have tho
I miss my zune lol, what a funky lil device
but does anyone have standalone mp3 players anymore?
isn't that like a walkman
as someone who has a walkman
boomer status tho
oh
I had a zune then an iPod touch then I got my first phone
My dad still has his
i had an mp3 player then ipod touch then i got a phone
never figured out how that shit worked
my grandma still has a samsung fliphone
my dad used one until four years ago
I miss the days of blackberry
same thing with smart phone
my fingers are relatively slim too and I still have tons of issues when typing on the phone
Oh gosh
I hate typing on a phone
Numerical typing would fuck me up
well I've considered possibly trying dvorak if I can find a keyboard for it
The kids don’t know what they’re missing
so i never got burnt out
they don't
I really can't remember
that's fair
since emphasis on home row
Isn’t it on windows 8 now?
I didn’t pay attention just bought the laptop I have no clue
I mean win10 isn't great either
I honestly can’t tell the difference outside of aesthetic changes
well part of the difference is as time goes on windows becomes even worse malware
> I mean win10 isn't great either
@nartha  windows in general aint it
Oh
Not anymore
Macs are worse than winblows
Mac is the worst of all possible worlds for a computer user
I mean yeah I can’t use SolidWorks on Mac so F
The only downside of me using Mac is I can’t use SolidWorks
dude if you want to use most programs mac doesn't work
I don’t play games
I prefer the connectivity of mac to the versatility of windows cz I don’t play that many games and I’m not a CS person
It depends more on your needs I think?
It’s like iPhone vs. android
It depends on what you want
I don’t care if I’m a normie Mac doesn’t fail me like windows has
My windows computer would get so many viruses even though I had mcafee
Windows erases shit without your consent at least from my experience and is slower too
what sort of crap are you installing to get so many viruses
also mcafee sucks
I don’t have viruses
And still does
Oh
likely you had a virus, that has never happened to me or to anyone I know ever in decades of using windows
Nah it’s my mom’s laptop she doesn’t download many things
Then I don’t want it
not really
who spends 2k on a laptop
I got a laptop for like $500 and I thought that was expensive
I still feel like a top end windows laptop might outperform a mac at the 2k range
Maybe the mac just has a novel feeling to it lol
I wasn't aware you could buy a laptop for 2k
the fans are shit
the ram is slow
And it's still hella pricy
the OS is in desperate need of improvements
jamfcloud sucks
cuz we cant mange macs the same
the main reason games don't work on linux after proton and stuff is drm screwing stuff up
as unfortunately these sorts of projects need very dedicated people, and attention spans are low.
Bruh people who still use wondows xp deserve some senior coupons
Nartha you need to switch majors
I too need to switch majors
Nah man comp sci is not something I want to work in
I  am learning COBOL though
yall acting like yall dont want thanksgiving break
I don’t
I don’t cap in my hatred of thanksgiving
But that’s the same shit you can have for Christmas too if ur granny isn’t lazy :Gundma:
Me want pwesents
Oliver Cromwell save us from this early Christmas celebration
Get that sorry excuse for a holiday mascot outta here. We need rudolf or the grinch on there
i hate picking new classes
> i used my coupon
@stuckinohiolads  ayyyy no coupons allowed. Didn’t you learn anything in that group?? 😂😂😂
Neel I’m sorry but you have to let go your pp
not yet raunak
> not yet raunak
@kaori_flute  you said today right?
dunno what i said
*never*
Really?
> *never*
@sprinkles2108  bruh you told me that her nitro is going over today
Oh raunak
they gave us twizzlers inside the candy bag
I didn’t imply that
> I didn’t imply that
@sprinkles2108  you kinda did
I’m scared now
DON'T TELL HIM
omg
> DON'T TELL HIM
@kaori_flute  I WONT
Lmao there prolly isn’t even something to say
Dear cwru, all I want for Christmas is a dorm room
Freshmen likely won’t be allowed to get apartments
if i dont have balls how can i pee
Triangle towers are apartments aren’t they?
> if i dont have balls how can i pee
@stuckinohiolads  you won’t
I think you can go in either through housing or as an outsider for triangle towers
to stop horny hours
Bold of u to assume horny hours would stop after my dick gets cut off
Fucking Po rlly did him in rip
No I don’t
I didn’t do anything
> I didn’t do anything
@raunakwastaken  [x]
It won’t load for me
OMG
I don’t belong in horny jail
So y’all can’t send me to horny jail

@raunakwastaken  Damn raunak’s made it this long without deleting it
This is all the evidence we need

“Wasn’t so bad”
@howdy_. I bet he'll give us a chess game to work with, I don't think he'll want us to use Project 3's game
Idk
Just realized I have meeting at 5:15, so rip being first for root beer float
Bruh ngl I hate root beer
Its ok to b wrong
I've had it once but maybe because it's bad
Anyways I don't want any more sugar than I'm already getting so I'll stay away from it lol
I’m getting too much sugar already
That won’t stop me tho Bc I’m not a coward
So we won’t have to code much 😌
If we have to reuse the code for project 3 and aren't given new code though people who didn't successfully do the project like @howdy_. will be ultra-screwed
Hate projects that build off of previous projects
They shouldn't be built off of previous projects
> Hate projects that build off of previous projects
@mootdoot  Hate projects ~~that build off of previous projects~~
I don't believe it will be, because it will also be harder to grade
i just think all class work should b multiple choice
bruh whatever happened to turpri
I don’t know
pri got cold feet
Do y’all want turpri back
> you all are cowards for not liking root beer and takis
@mootdoot  idk what either of them is
> Do y’all want turpri back
@sprinkles2108  we don’t want you back
Leave
I won’t
But you have left before so you can leave
Bruh the police can't find anybody lol
police cant ever do anything so
i mean, if u want me to?
Well fuck
>  there are no grounds to remove me
@sprinkles2108  there are, We don’t like you
I didn’t violate any rules though
Unlike some people who can’t
I won’t visit you
I don’t wanna meet you
Tell Zack that I would never settle
Or someone else
Oh
Imagine cleaning after Clifford"s boulder-sized turfs
> CLIFFORD IS ADORABLE
@sprinkles2108 how can someone be so wrong
**wrong
Ur not incel enough rip
Well shit
I don’t even see the incel channel
I have class not class at 5:15 and idk when it’s gonna end 😭😭
sowwy my values don't allow me to do that :))))
Oh dairy?
*bye values here i mean money*

Fair enoughhhh
If my meeting goes over I will simply just leave
I really want a root beer float
i do be low rn so won't go soon (at least) :))))
What time is ur meeting supposed 2 end?
Jenin another month of nitro??
I feel that
You can't take a brain break if you don't have one
> You can't take a brain break if you don't have one
@nobelium19 you just create one
so
anyone wants 3 months of xbox for pc?
I do, but i took it last time
There u go jenin, found someone
Click forgot pass if you cant remember at all
Wydm google password holder thingie isn’t enough?
unless
i can't use this 3 month more than once--------
I guess we'll find out
Oh gotcha
My greatest shame
I hope he finds someone
U got it right tho
Its a toss up really rn. Economy has dropped so much this past week that it supports Biden now, polls say biden, political scientists who have predicted everything right since 1976 say biden
Didnt 2016 they predict clinton
We see how that ended
If they split them them its going to be really close
Between July 31 and Oct 31 stonks dropped so much with the last covid surge that it flipped to biden
Some people who can't ambulate or need assistance or can't drive well won't go if its shid weather
He doesn’t add much to it
Rip

Cold > warm
The sexc weather ofc ofc

They aren’t I promise
So far they have not said anything I haven’t already known, and are also just making me sad abt my lack of options
Rip
Um, isnt it the same way we did it this semester?
Rip
haven’t been on here in a minute
Yea and as I’ve just learned, some random survey that asked us about what times we wanted to do clinical and lab times at apparently determines the actual classes we take
just been kinda bad cuz I haven’t seen my friends
I thought it was to just gauge interest but kinda sucks that they asked at a time when I def wasn’t considering my spring semester wtf

Not missing out on much dw
Wondering if I should go back

The avocado truck sucks

beck just taught me how to use the card scanner on the door
Oh shit???
I want dorm cat
it goes so fast
the box isnt just a box
You guys make me want to open my door and see
Grrr curse my high traffic room placement
Hitting the button doesn't make the room open
idk if the button actually does anything
If you press it it lights up on the back, on the inside of the room
Oh that was the button I just tried to press lolol
10 weeks into the semester
So you don't have to hammer on the door
Curse ur not high traffic room smh
esp when im dead to the world
That light would do nothing for me if I’m not staring directly at the door lol
I can’t see it from any other perspective
Does it work for outside too?
It did work tru
Have you tried telling ur house ppl to text knock knock
i heard you cant be punished by RA's if you cross your toes
Sorry I can't hear anything but the absurdly loud music from the damn food truck 24/7
I don't think this is what they meant when they said that knockers got a guy's attention.
Oh I vaguely heard food truck sounds when walking back to room
lmaoo someone's leaving piss bottles in the bathroom?
doesnt that defeat the purpose of piss bottles
wtf
i dont get people who do that type of stuff honestly
bro the bathrooms are like 2 feet away
If you don’t discard your piss bottles properly, urine trouble.
this about it in terms of work
so 0 work is done
aren't piss bottles a slang term for beer?
Fejes putting in that work :SniffSneezeTears:
She’s working so hard it’s scary

@mootdoot  “CHEM 105 this semester isn’t much different from previous semesters”- Drew Meyer
Honestly I don’t know
I know I won’t win for sure lmfao
what happened now
And I can't walk to Wade without seeing violations in Norton and Sherman
I really just want to sit down and ask people, genuinely, why they hang their nose out, why they don't follow policy, and just learn
And it's going to be even worse in the spring
Sad
Its really sad
Genuinely it makes me sad
No time to feel sad when u can start fights
the rona cant get you in there
I'm not scared of it; I just don't want my kids getting it, and especially because this is a virus that you can do more of to prevent spread than prevent contraction
If I do die Bc my sad at risk ass gets infected by someone on campus just know I’ll haunt the school to hell
Shane is one of my kids, yet
I know 8 people who are actively very sick in my hometown. Young people. Who do everything right, but nobody around them does, so now they're really sick
One of my friend's mom is in the hospital
Oh yikes
Lady whose house I slept over at, who picked me up from school in the car pool, who I've known since I was 5 years old
Could be dying
Went to the hospital because she was so short of breath that she couldn't drink or eat
Passed out trying to go get water
People just act like it doesn't exist
Oh damn
But because people don't protect their families, and go to the fucking home depot to get them a new washin' machine and a big bag of poppity corn with no mask, the death rate is about 12% there
Senate doesn’t do much
I have some sus friends doing sus things but I trust that they’re not entirely stupid
OH and that even though my chipotle was stolen today they made me another one🥰
And I guess he went to pick it up p late
And he didn’t find my order
omg
I’ll only forgive the thief if he was genuinely poor or homeless
i believe we still have to go to chem zoom tomorrow
At least I can say that I tried
Sarah if balderson is reelected imma lose it

Imagine being named Balderson, couldn't be me
My history teacher said that if Jesus ran as a democrat, Jim Jordan would still win
Same though

Don't
What general area of Ohio though

Close enough
Don't know where that is, but if I-75 exits help, I'm around exit 90

Jesus I'm sorry that's as bad as Lima
Any rural part of Ohio is as bad as anything
Can't forget about Convoy
Bad*

Geography outside of Chicago doesn't exist to those windy city folk

Oh well I hate Miami
Miami is annoying
Oh and Dayton

Bowling is too much math
What school
ARE YOU SERIOUS
Nope
but not knowing US geography means you have paid zero attention in school
Ron isnt wrong
Ron is wrong
Will I get paid big money for it? Will it prevent me from dying?
The worst state in the entire USA lies directly below us, waiting, breeding corruption. 
*kentucky*
Mississippi holy shit
But they do have Walmart tho
You can't delete everything
I took a government class and that’s it
Without it
Idk what geography has to do with that
Idk delete button looking real sexc rn
Don’t care much for retaining that info tho
It won’t retain bio knowledge
Rip
@toomanyzs I don't see a difference
The Onion wrote an article on this country’s worst 50 states🤠
thats even worse than nothing
leaving south florida
I mean fuck Maine
WTF
IM GONNA CRY
That's even worse
lobsters bad
RON LITERALLY GO TO HISTORY CLASS PLEASE
To be fair Maine was Massachusetts at one time
History class wouldn’t teach me this??
geology class
I don't even want to know Ron's international geographical knowledge
I hope your directional sense doesn't translate to anatomy
Last time I learned geography was in 4th grade and it was for a week
Wtf
Though some major in nursing and do pre med
Ron you need a map for Christmas
Someone get Ron a mf globe
Femur proximal is the ischium? I always forgot which one is on top
Oh so I got it
Didnt learn that in class yet so gotta tell me oh wise and worthy king
Oh learning abt meiosis in class rn
She’s got that shit on a terrifying lock
Will never become president
you need to know where to campaign
isn't that macedonia
oh shit
or I guess northern macedonia now
Man I miss tacos
There is a taco truck parked 60 feet from your door
I did just say I missed them
Not that I wanted them
If I did want them tho I can start counting down the days
my knowledge of middle eastern geography gets worse than my european, but at least I know a lot of the major bits
worst state of the 13 colonies
didnt they separate in the civil war?
i forgot their name
you dont mean to tell me you dont know john henry the steel driving man
@toomanyzs Bruh no their drivers are HORRIBLE
Worse than the Massholes?
I can’t eat steel so,,,the man isn’t important to me
Nvm been to Mass so can't comment on that
Boston and Chicago are the worst I've seen
Detroit is pretty bad too
> or CBUS @sprinkles2108
@toomanyzs  nah we don’t stan Maryland
Oh
I didn't apply because I didn't take subject tests
Too stupid at math
I suck at test taking
My math 2 score was shit
If you didn't get an 800 then it was seen as bad
Which I thought was stupid
as fuck
I didn’t get an 800
Close though
But I wanted an 800
I HATE TEST TAKING
I SUCK AT TEST TAKING
Didn't help me at all tho
I think a lot of ppl suck at taking tests
I used to suck at tests but with accomodations I am a testing god
Fuck you OCD
I still suck though
Bruh Bio do be sucky tho
couldnt b me
I see the max as 100 on the bio exam and I'm like 👁️ 👄 👁️
> I see the max as 100 on the bio exam and I'm like 👁️ 👄 👁️
@nobelium19  ME TOOO
There are always some mega premeds that go hard on bio
I find they are mostly boring people
It’s cwru tho
Capitalism class
Capitalism class
Abt econ n shit
Its the only class I ever took where people would wear suits to class
Sad to hear this is what they’re teaching the youth 😔😔
Sad to hear it
I am no longer god
dudes would ride their personal bird scooters to class and then ask "Um, hypothetically, if there were a stimulus blah blah blah blah" that boils down to them hating poor people
Clearly that class was fake
look, all I’m saying that capitalism needs reform
All I’m saying is that idk nuke it or something
But I don’t wanna get further into it
Can’t nuke it and rebuild it you’d eventually rebuild the same thing
Jojo onto some shit
I’ll work on the nuking priyanka can work on the reforming
Tbh the reason why I'm planning to minor in economics is because I want to do math instead of writing papers even in social sciences/humanities classes
Papers do suck tho
I'm thinking of taking two math theory (proof-based) classes next semester (Discrete Math and Linear Algebra) so I'm reading a book about math proofs to prepare myself
Oh gosh
> I'm thinking of taking two math theory (proof-based) classes next semester (Discrete Math and Linear Algebra) so I'm reading a book about math proofs to prepare myself
@_frostyyyyy_  have fun that sounds horrible
I think it’s p time intensive tho
It's really annoying me
I'm taking 18 credits and I haven't had to do any all-nighters yet, but I also feel like I have no time outside of classes/extracurriculars
Shit I have a bio lab report due tomorrow
I’m still up
Ugh
I DIDNT EVEN FINISH MY STUPID REPORT
Yesterday night was a fever dream
Got flamed for not knowing American geography yet no one told me why it would ever be relevant or necessary outside of flaming me :dogegun:
Last time this happened, she :simp: for somemore
She technically still has nitro
See jenin didn’t send an emote
SHE STILL HAS CONTENT
WHY ISNT SHE SENDING EMOTES
SO WHAT IF HER NITRO IS EXPIRED. SHE STILL HAS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT FORM
> war
@djsurti  can’t fight with a weakling
My homework
Y’all sleep on hard mattresses? I sleep in my own bed😌
Also the mattresses are not bad
@_frostyyyyy_ Damn sucks
Yeah I don't know why everyone be complaining about the beds, they really aren't that bad
this past summer I didn't even get to sleep in my own bed more than once a week
Maybe that's because I'm always sleep-deprived so falling asleep isn't a problem
I want to take a j term class but my parents are thinking of going to India
I WANT A LIGHTER SPRING SCHEDULE
I JUST WANNA STUDY SOCIOLOGY
Because I’m pissed at bio
I’m p sure my TA was in a terrible mood
Rip my bio grade
RIP
Idk jenin I guess they’re too tired
Only 2 more exams
Oh yeah that among us is today isn't it
Zach doesn't miss
I don’t know man
Because this winter break is longer lol
I don’t know
I’d rather stay here and take a j term class
~~No wonder US sucks~~
OH FUCK YEAH LASAGNA TIME
Nope that's cursed
I'd just like to say that I've never been misquoted by the press in here so
I’m sorry to hear that Nobel
Oh I didn't pay attention
Rip
You made too much eye contact for me not to know something was up
sorry for the awkwardness
And he went Tyler
HOLY SHIT

And then to do some work
damn it's been a minute since i went to that dunkins

you not wrong though the mattresses are hard asf
I don’t know
Downright awful person though
Internet explorer ass Raunak
> Internet explorer ass Raunak
@toomanyzs  I’m in my class smh
5’5 is not short
Sorry raunak
6'1 isn't short for a guy
I never said that
Jenin I don’t know why but I thought you’d be my height
but it turns out i just went to a disproportionately tall high school
Sad
> u did not
@kaori_flute  oh really I didn’t know that
No the guy working at dunkin's had some gnarly old man hands
@toomanyzs do you think it's too early to declare your major
Will my SAGES professor resent me trying to get another advisor by declaring a major/minor?
can't you just say that you want to declare early to get access to more departmental resources? Mine encouraged me to do that
I don't think that they want more work
unless you have an abhorrent prof, i don't see a downside to it
Nope
Huge bonk to everyone here who hasn’t voted yet😌
Ah shit you hit me Priyanka
Ranauk aren’t you international
> Ah shit you hit me Priyanka
@raunakwastaken  I can’t bonk you you can’t vote here yet
I can’t vote anywhere yet
Nope
Don’t boomer me
I’m sorry but I have to
Raunak is just annoying ignore him
Wrong reaction image but I'm gong with it
School shootings are p normal here😳
Aren’t there security guards at schools?
> Aren’t there security guards at schools?
@raunakwastaken  uhhh
> Aren’t there security guards at schools?
@raunakwastaken  sometimes
Depends on the school
But often they’re just police officers that want to further the school to prison pipeline 🙂
You looked at a camera
before school shootings became a major problem it was far easier
Like how before 9/11 there was no airport security
well there was a decent amount of airport security
We had to write who we’re voting for in our math quiz today
I wanted to write Modi
If y’all wanna know how scared some Americans can be at schools now, one time last year I was in the bathroom during lunch, and heard a SCREECH like how you hear them in shootings and I froze and my heart raced a lot
> I wanted to write Modi
@raunakwastaken  WHY DIDNT YOU
>  WHY DIDNT  YOU
@sprinkles2108  didnt wanna get political
Indian politics don’t matter so much here
Oh interesting Id be scared to cz like Trump SI seeing it is not it
> IMRAN KHAN 2024
@chandachan  *indians want to know your location*
> @chandachan  *~~indians~~ BJP wants to know your location*
@raunakwastaken
> RAHUL GANDHI 2024 HAHAHAHAHA
@sprinkles2108  Pappu can’t win
Omg Nehru I hate that guy
Don’t the results come out tonight?
Trump wants the election to end tonight
Like will they announce the results without the ballot counts?
technically the true results aren't until the electoral college meets and votes
So tonight nothing is coming out?
I don’t even know
Oh
I guess I’m wrong
they don't vote by head for president
nope
i wish i was man
sarah im trying to look at you but the pillar is in the way
Oh the context is that my best friend and his whole family are sick because his ~~republican~~ grandparents were sick for 2 weeks and kept going to their business to hang out and now they all feel terrible and his parents tested positive
you dont say
Oh new news says that old next door neighbors had it
damn
> Oh the context is that my best friend and his whole family are sick because his ~~republican~~ grandparents were sick for 2 weeks and kept going to their business to hang out and now they all feel terrible and his parents tested positive
@toomanyzs Yeah rural Ohio just doesn't care
Seems like a lot of rural places don’t
Which is a shame bc their access to healthcare isn’t the best
nothing i just feeel like being annoying rn
and not doing work ❤️
Except i going on a walk
im ... sleep
and then i really had to pee so we walked back early
Its still warm
i hate doing the knowledge checks
Learning hard 4 smol brains
sleepy
want bed
Day feels long
But I haven’t done anything?
> I have my face Bc nursing prof said it’s unnerving to h talking to a mass of black screens
@mootdoot You don't turn on cameras?
I dont turn on mine, i be 👻
Why would I ever turn on camera willingly
I'm not going to be the only one though
Lol then just don’t turn it on
Never too old to color
Tho*
I have like 10 sharpie markers but haven't used them once
he teach the " What is college for" sages
We cant do first semter sages anymore tho
sad
Fair
he gave us class off tomorrow bc of election recovery/celebration.. whichever way it goes..
Damn, break b nice
Oh, did nurses already get classes?
I wanted to change but I couldn’t smh
I didnt realize that preset tho
I would never b president
I’m not nearly dumb enough
Presidemt is lame, you want to be cia for all the good info
Whats bad w/ afternoon?
Ye, cuz all the ppl wake up and head over
We got to do post mortem from someone who died in the morning
A drama a day keeps the nurses at  bay
Keeps you on ur toes
Isn’t that junior year?
next semester we have 16 hrs
Quick maths
I didn’t know the survey was our actual choices and I chose 8am lab
Close to
So ofc now I can’t do 7am clinical
Keeps my Thursdays free
Eh I won’t bother
i have my sched for next sem who wants to see
Imagine having schedules, couldnt b me
And this is why I’m working so hard to preserve my Thursdays
Last time I can do it
starting junior year clinicals switch to monday wednesday
Oh clutchhh I have more chances
alfes doesnt teach medsurg lmao
More days to go to ksl and work ol
Oh she sits in my lab
Didnt kno that
Ron dont even know her teach rip
Seems suspect
tomorrows my last real lab 😭
Oh dang what abt the next 3 weeks
the next two weeks are test outs
Oh
Why 2 weeks?
They told us there’s wouldn’t b a step by step rubric and half the class went into Panik
Oh, so its like a mini test 4 each b4 final
After having it for how many weeks
The body we had to prep was going to autopsy so we didn’t have to remove it
Graduate school :sadcat:
Couldnt b me
Unless someone pays me 2 do it
Although I’ve heard there *debate* over NPs
I think it’s literally just doctors questioning that tho
that sounds stupid
Precincts aren't reporting yet
it’s so early we aren’t gonna know anything for a while
However, how *close* kentucky and indiana are could be an indicator
Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania are going to be fucking stressful
A shit load will close at 7 so be ready
Ohio is kinda moving away from swing state status
idk i give ohio 50/50
I don't want to see a Bush v. Gore again
Even though I wasn't alive when it happened
John Roberts is the only person who might do something that the Republicans don't approve of
he’s the only like republican on the court i can somewhat respect since he doesn’t just follow the pack
roberts isn’t liberal but he doesn’t always side with the right
he’s been getting closer and closer to the left
I don't support court packing
Yeah I'm not big with court packing either
Gorsuch swung in a really important decision and wrote the majority opinion and I can't remember what it was
But if we start it then the Republicans will cry foul and start doing it and then everyone will start doing it
Rooselvely tried to pack the court
oh yeah will be an absolute shit show
Yeah, destroy the supreme court because orange man bad.
You'd have to go away from nominations
Votes unfortunately also are extremely political
Like years as a judge, cases tried, etc
amy couldn’t even name the rights protected by the first amendment smh
same reason voting restrictions are a bad idea
I wish news places wouldn't air this stuff until all the votes are counted
but they'd lose too much money
whens ohio polls close?
won't stop him from prematurely declaring victory and whipping his supporters into a frenzy
could be another 2000 election though
I didn't realize that most elections aren't close
i’m worried about the backlash if trump loses
theres gonna be backlash either way
I'm more worried about antifa burning things down lol
my bad guys
damn biden back in florida
Though idk what’s gonna happen
% so close tho
Trump's doing remarkably well with Hispanic and black voters but lost some of his old white voter base
idk man, I think it's too close to call
biden just went back in the lead
tho i agree
also, i hate the shape of west virgina
The panhandle is the major section that hasn't been called yet and they went deep red in 2016.
oh damn, that's interesting
didn't see that lol
If you don’t know jenin your life is sad
Omg Texas is blue since
Never
I'm just saying, Ohio has a history of getting the president right
Bruh what's wrong with North Carolina, I can't wait all day
adam, u hate the shape cuz its a terrible connection of man made borders and natural borders clashing
I guess i do
like africa but worse...
wtf were people on while designing west africa
I have a map of Nigeria and I rlly do hate looking at it
Horrible on the eyes
Driving through it is just as bad
angola is also terrible
omg we should listren to this
Rip borders
guess where i live
Oh
Dc is its own vibe tho
is it named after the city or the person tho
person named the mountain tho
i wonder if there is any city without mlk drive, or rd, or bouravard
my guess is in alabama
If there is they legally don’t count as a city
` Kansas City is one of the only major US cities without a street named after the civil rights icon.`
rip kansas
Hausa Igbo I forgot the 3rd one
Can’t have a real fight without all the bros in there
In terms of like, western education tho Yoruba ppl are crazy abt that I feel
Everyone hates him tho
i mean fair enough u can present any woman in a headwrap and ill sit here like wow okay african queen😩
they saying if biden wins ohio trump can’t win 👀
I forgot his name
Shame
I guess ppl just dont hava hw
i’m just ignoring hw rn because i do be stressed already
I'd imagine that now is a lul in the homework for most people
Rip
Cuz that be the life of a smol brain
if trump wins im finna stop doing hw
or we fail
fuck trump is gonna win florida
biden is leading in ohio tho
it'd be surprising if they didn't
oh yeah i forgot that cubans are pretty conservative
since lbj
they have yet to report on oregon, washington
f in the chat for me cuz i killed someone in among us right in front of someone else
oh no ohio
mag the sad part is that the two other candidate votes plus biden would've won ohio
so rip
jo jorgeson and howie hawkin (idk if i spelled their names correctly)
can't remember which is which
tho
dude im just nervous if u couldnt tell lmao
I wasn't nervous for last election
and I' would've preffered hillary but i didnt care
> dude im just nervous if u couldnt tell lmao
@mag3is same Mag same
AS A FEMALE POC I JUST WANT TO BE RESPECTED
That is all wrong.
aparently that just happened
CANT
idk if we can get enough people though
i get rekt on the exams
if you want to do my compsci prelab sure :P
Like I feel helpless
North Carolina literally elected a Nazi to office
Not yet.
Omg
Wtf
Wtf
still don't get it but ok
smh my head
omg west coast came in clutchhhh
Because the major swing states aren't called yet.
oh shit
it won't be called for a while
i think iowa is still in play
not gonna matter much idk
damn
but wont be real until its all counted
Trump needs two of them
idk how its this close tbh
bro you'd think the US people aren't stupid enough to reelect trump wtf
i'm not either
Cleveland showed tf out for Biden though
Americans, imo, are on average more stupid than any other country on the planet
Cubans really won Florida for Trump
Socialism doesn't exactly play well to people with a knowledge of history.
dude, capitalism is flawed yes. but it needs reform
Don’t even get me started on trickle down economics lmaooooooo
im just really worried for what things i could lose
im sorry mag :(
I have a pre-existing condition can’t wait to lose health coverage by greedy private insurances
biden aint gonna do nothing bout that, both of our canadits are conservative on the global scale
yeah the rich should not be getting richer and the poor poorer. the best solution is the reform the system, and make it so that everyone has an equal chance to WORK their way up.
idk yet about it
> yeah the rich should not be getting richer and the poor poorer. the best solution is the reform the system, and make it so that everyone has an equal chance to WORK their way up.
@sprinkles2108  

You literally describes democratic socialism 😆
Except the most socialist state California has the worst wealth disparity. Just like how China has the most billionaires in the world and horrific poverty.
zack, you were implying that capitalism should be completely abolished. i am saying the broken parts of it should be fixed
It’s pretty damn broken
bro i hate the south
> Except the most socialist state California has the worst wealth disparity. Just like how China has the most billionaires in the world and horrific poverty.
@joyousmischief  

Has to do more with tech conglomerates in Silicon Valley along with garbage neo-liberal policies. There also isn’t a huge statistical trend in wealth inequality in R vs D states. Louisiana is second in the list for example
so if BIden musters in more electoral college votes
are you saying it shouldn't be abolished?
i mean, it's really not fair. trump lost the popular vote in 2016
last time we had a political debate there the clifford cult was born
i don't even know what you guys are debating about lol we just trying to see if biden can pull this one through
we really have 18 y/o trump supporters worried about biden's tax plan as if they already make $400k or more annually
they don't listen
Only in America is it considered radical to want people to be able to have a medical emergency and NOT have to suffer financially
if they dont listen
sadly we can't deport americans LOL
I feel like people who hold a college degree can at least discern stupidity from veracity
"stop being political" bro i want everyone to have a chance at life
which states are left?
my mental state is left
that state is in ruin since chem existed
and study
at least i can say that i tried
Apparently 300,000 ballots got “lost” by the USPS
worse
oh fr?
i didn't know that
very close
but look, shit is still weird:

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-election-map/#FL:1,NH:0,CO:0,AZ:0,NC:1,GA:1,OH:1
(this is based off states that were either 100% or mostly called)
6head?
unless they have yet to count a stash of biden votes in ohio
OH WHAT
cuz um well
I'm going to bed. I can't take the stress. I can't stand the thought that I'm going to go to zoom medical school
Ic so nothing has changed then
i got key lime and bday cake left
Had me at caramel lost me at fudge
I wish I could keep fresh fruit, but im so worried abt it spoiling
cuz midterms happened
Any of my fruit infusions can last ~5 days or 3 refills so a single fruit can take me pretty far
It’s easier to just get a bag of frozen fruit, that lasts me months of water
I’m currently surviving off of the teas I’m cold brewing
Yea honestly wasn’t expecting the amount of things that were too large for the fridge
Also, the back of my fridge freezes shit solid???
thats how freezers work ron
protip, move it so it doesnt touch the walls
cuz i left it in the back
Like I can’t put juice back there or when I need it I can’t drink it smh
so it doesnt touch
I’ll squeeze random shit in the door compartments
I would put it to 3 to attempt to prevent freezing but I would also like cold water
im telling ya, as long as it doesnt touch the back wall where the coolent runs, u should be good
Biden only needs 50 more electoral votes
All I have in my fridge rn is the root beer, water filter, and a tiny bit of salsa left
If Biden wins by virtue of the electoral college i aint even capping we can keep the electoral college 💀
Nah don’t say that king
Don’t put ur crown down like that
They out there eating dairy queen and shit
Or if you wanna keep the electoral at least have them vote w the constituents like they’re supposed to I think
oh shit trump just climbed from 118 to 145
Ion pray no more sorry
can it be a religion if its the only truth tho
*tbh, i never knew why they were called concretes cuz they just seemed like a thick milkshake*
They don’t even make it try to go thru a straw
Imma sleep in about half an hour
I’m listening to their discography n that’s why I’m awake rip
there isn't even a lab 9
biden already lost
8 labs + 2 exams + final project
he hasnt lost yet
he's lost Mag
not yet
can someone send some tasty drama from ppl on social media, theres got to be some goodness
if he did lose then its really not okay
Gotta have diff levels of Cs tho
case doesnt do + or -, tis odd
those are left to win
Rather just lose all those points
Didnt they try to murder her or smth
Like Biden will still pull in the electoral voted
Idk
Oh shit
Wtf
periods control the electoral college
i dont think we should
then we'd get fishe problems
Damn riperoni
we won't know for sure for a few days
Really?
shit its almost 1am
it really do b
we need to abolish it
Talked to my dad he said half his employees showed up an hour late lmao
really isnt
since we had it for harvesting and crops
and now we rlly dont need it
That one person who voted feeling real salty rn
yea, the worms do be leaving salt
cuz someone probably is
Trump's reelection: more COVID death, more fearmongering, more political division
Fuck his munchies I wanna sleep
Damn
close nose
> Trump's reelection: more COVID death, more fearmongering, more political division
@bravo5127  

He is likely going to win despite the COVID fiasco. Imagine if that didn’t happen...
Hatred > their own needs
Aca can’t help me if healthcare system fucked 😔
And I don’t even like the democrats either
Hate it all
i walked outta school w/ a chair during a fire "drill" cuz hell if i was going to just stand there for like 30min
Fuck I look like ppl stealing my stuff
Leave me be
But then everyone wants their own rights
Economically is a different issue but they aren’t assholes
Someone’s either having a kbbq outside of my room or there is a drug or a poison floating round here
i dunno if this's been posted here yet
Missed it
Trump would be dying after five steps
Biden isn’t obese
-0 isn’t a real number, and neither are these men’s stamina
clearly we need a western style style standoff
we need high noon
Never have never will
I have no idea what that means Bc that wasn’t even a sentence
sentences dont exist smh
i wanna leave the country
I mean get a dual citizenship somewhere and pretend that country isn’t being affected by western politics
*no dont*
Take the man out of American but never take the American out of the man
doesnt exist
Nope
Running to slightly more utopia looking places just makes things worse, that’s how America was made lol
running away is ez
dont have to face ur problems
or work on em
Walk at a moderate pace away from ur problems
Find tallest tree
but their fuel efficency sucks
Okay that one requires a bit more work
damn slow timer
cuz im taking engr 131
oh
at least not yet
The timer is there cuz ur not supposed to be having conversations in there smh
nope
thats a p lame major
cs major boring af
Still a computational thing tho
once i saw my dad'd work on take your child to work day i was like NO to cs
i can't even process bio knowledge
i take 3-5 days just to precess that i didnt process any info
nd then its exam times
Yuh that info didn’t process well either
i hv cs 438 hw due tmrw I:
now how does that work
well since you were smart enough to get into cwru they expect you to already know c
it actually doesnt
nothing can help
gonna actually compile that rq to see wtf it does
oh
i need attention
> to start learning c now
@inexorablesalmon  ah shit
im so sleepy
All the votes left are from democrat strongholds
Likely though since these were mail ballot votes they would break even *harder* for Biden
PA is a tossup but having 1.6-1.7 MILLION EIPV/VBM ballots not counted yet in PA gives me very serious hope
so if he gets GA he needs 1 of wi, mi, pa
if not he needs two of them
Data doesn’t lie
Those votes all lean heavy democrat and there are more than enough to break the lead trump has. As long as they are counted and not thrown out by trump’s lawyers I seriously believe Biden will win
i really dont wanna lose the right to marry lmao 🙃
I dont think.trump.will take that away
I think that the most important thing to acknowledge is that it is too close to call rn, and that it was predicted to be like this months pre-election
i think its gonna be close
Some mail ballots finna get "lost" en route
Unfortunately GA. WI and MI don’t have party data for VBM
Percentages mean nothing
I was wrong
PA has 2.2 million VBM that haven’t been counted yet
I’m not super confident about WI unless I can find more about the VBM situation
But PA I feel really good about, MI and GA I think Biden will win, WI is ehhhhhh I need more info
alot of the votes missing in wi are from Milwaukee
~~weirdly enough it seems like Florida likes Biden more but there's a better chance Bernie beats Trump in Florida~~
nope nevermind I'm talking out of my ass I have no clue whether what I said is true or not anymore
idk what to believe
It really sucks they don’t show what party requested and returned how many ballots it’d make this guessing game sooo much easier :/
oh heres trump
If Fulton and DeKalb came in at the same rate they have been and the percent yet to be reported is accurate, Biden would net 126K votes. Right now, he trails by 118K.
I’d assume it’d be more since it was mostly VBM mail but... please dear Jesus ^Georgia
at least aoc won idk she seems cool ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
he doesnt think AZ is bidens
"we dont need all of them"
There are still like a million day of votes that need to be counted for Arizona. That state is definitely not over.
doesn't matter, Arizona doesn't give Biden the win
in 5% of elections, the winning president lost the popular vote
> There are still like a million day of votes that need to be counted for Arizona. That state is definitely not over.
@joyousmischief  

I agree although I do think Biden takes it
trump is v mad about people mailing in ballots
The fact that he is whining this much is both optimistic yet terrifying
You know he’s scared those votes will make him lose but he’s going to fight it and get his supporters to fight for him
roberts will side with left but we would need 1 more
don't alienate the other 50% of the nation
I'm seeing so many insta posts saying "don't be my friend if you voted trump"
My brain hurts from crunching voting numbers for the last two hours
I honestly didn’t think the race will be so close
im going to bed... nothing is gonna change for a few hours anyways
voting has ended
The article is titled “wants voting to stop”
he wants all votes to not count anymore
just completely stop
which is really really messed up
> The article is titled “wants voting to stop”
@joyousmischief  

He wants counting of votes to stop too
Is Microsoft office being weird
Or is it my laptop
I almost had a panic Bc I was trying to do my sages final draft and it went bonk
Biden could still win GA
Lot of votes left to be counted in DeKalb which is a Dem stronghold
there is a chance for GA idk how much but is possible
WAIT WTF BIDEN HAS WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN!!!! WTF YES!!!
yoo Trump just implied it’s rigged on his tweets he must be MALDING! He prematurely declared victory now he’s saying this shit
not really
Trump has to sit the fuck down
Other than crying on Twitter
like if he doesnt win... getting him to leave office could be something
this is wut i think is gonna happen... the lighter colored ones are still unknown
ive been playing with the map a bit lmao i didnt expect the race to be this close at the start tbh
PA Is still very very much in play for Biden
Trump basically needs to get 4 states
If he gets Pennsylvania, Georgia, and NC as projected he needs one more state among Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nevada
I think Wisconsin and Arizona are a lost cause for Trump, most likely Michigan as well
Nevada might still hold some possibility but we won't know until Thursday I believe
Trump lost Arizona already
Oh well then I guess some websites haven't called it yet lol
Idk maybe google is wrong I’m just using their live update thing
51-47 with 14% left
~450k left to count with Biden 90k lead
They already called Arizona though
It's likely to go to Biden at the moment but I don't know why they called it so early, anything can happen
Yo someone in the groupme said that the Wisconsin election administrator said all ballots have been counted and Biden won. Though, I can’t find any news source that says that. Can someone confirm?
pennsylvania do be the real kicker tho
cnn said results won't be finalized till tn for wisconsin, michigan, arizona, NC, GA, and nevada
No one won yet?
No one’s won yet
Mail-in ballots are still being counted
They’re saying Friday at the latest apparently
people took Chris Butler's advice to heart
Holy crap, it was a whole 752 people in the county instead of 750 registered in October.
You ever send an email to your prof and notice a typo and die a little inside because SAME
The 128k votes in Michigan counted without one for Trump is a bit less so.
Trump IS spreading misinformation about the election on there. He already declared victory when ballots are still being counted
Can we all agree that him already declaring victory is wrong smh
Yeah, when most of the ballots have been counted. Not when there are still plenty of states that still have not finished counting their ballots
I don't see how Michigan can go to Trump
The only county that hasn't counted most of it is Wayne and they're heavily Democratic
Isn't that right across from Norton
aw fuck ok
it's either that or putting a cvt on a bike
That's sick
I may just go with a cvt bike tho cause like
is a pain
I don't even know how to begin on that
Appears Arizona is still in play for Trump
i used to think it would be cool to live through a historic event but now i realize i was stupid
Just this one sucks
House has dem majority though
Oh
I don’t know guys this election is so close like
They should just do the senate then, Idk why they did the house if they're not even going to do representation
Like I agree with it but it’s going to be BAD if that scenario happens
Imagine if a faithless elector happened
OMG that would be a controversy
They cote for someone that isn’t Trump or Biden
Uhh idk because I still think they need 270 to win?
I mean the tie is highly unlikely but it’s still very real
I need PA, GA, AZ and NV to update their damn vote count
They really are stalling hard right now.
I mean it’d be hard to project who Jorgensen supporters would swing too
> I need people to count votes faster lmao
@sprinkles2108  

Blame the republicans for not letting mail ballots be counted until polls closed in PA among other states 🤷🏽‍♂️
Take an early lead because of Election Day votes, make sure mail ballots aren’t fully counted so they have to be delayed, claim you win because said votes aren’t counted, then claim rigged when they get counted late
I guess it’s the same as dropping off your ballot
But still
> Take an early lead because of Election Day votes, make sure mail ballots aren’t fully counted so they have to be delayed, claim you win because said votes aren’t counted, then claim rigged when they get counted late
@zackt7718  this. This. This.
I don't like this post election counting but they should've been counted pre-election
But the Supreme Court justice hearing pissed me off the most
Poor Merrick Garland
They wouldn’t even have a hearing for Merrick Garland in 2016
9 MONTHS BEFORE
I don’t want to pack the courts but if Republicans want to play dirty games so should the dems
So far I haven’t heard a single Republican give a reasonable justification for this stupidity
I don’t like packing the courts either but screw it Barrett made it through
If trump win re election and R’s kept the senate I’d still hate to see ACB as a scotus but there wouldn’t be anything wrong with the process that got to it
True they would’ve, both parties suck
Dems just suck a little less
> But I knew a black guy running in SOUTH CAROLINA wasn’t gonna win
@zackt7718  sad
I don't remember any turtles on Sesame Street tho
I wish Polio took McConnel out -
I do not stan Mitch though but I wouldn’t wish harm on him
He laughed at 230k people dying from COVID
Wishing your political opponents burn in hell is another example of exactly how not to do politics.
Better answer is don’t do politics
> U get no girls doing politics
@mootdoot  I don’t get gurls either way so 🤷🏻‍♂️
That’s fair
Because Trumping someone is the same as eternal torment.
Trump made fun of Biden’s dead son
McConnel laughed at 230k people dying
Yeah trump.puts republicans to shame
AZ has 14% left with a 3% lead for Biden
Wisconsin just went to Biden
I’m not worried at all about Michigan
19% of Wayne county is still not reported and Biden has a 60k lead
We need Nevada Michigan and wi
So we need Nevada at this point
If Trump gets PA, GA, and AZ he doesn’t need Nevada
He won’t get AZ
If they weren’t on Election Day Biden will win but... we don’t know
Holy shit Nevada is so tight rn
So many more people voted this year in Georgia
GA will be very close
Lotttaaa blue counties in GA have 20%+ left to report
Google one is shit
I pay close attention to uk elections
Uk politics are hilarious
Everyone here wants trump to win
> Everyone here wants trump to win
@raunakwastaken  in India?
Biden has like 10 counties with 10+% votes left
Modi seems like he'd be aligned with trump
Trump hates china
India hates China
There is really only 4 states left in play
I can’t believe Indians would support trump
Trump puts on a charade for China he hasn’t done anything to hurt them
Honestly Modi doesn’t care who’s president in the US he just wants to be our BFF
Cause we in the majority
> Cause we in the majority
  libs: destroyed
Nevada just got really really close
Ok raunak libs in India arent libs they’re just haters
Nah it just moved unless I missed something
> Nah it just moved unless I missed something
@zackt7718  it didn’t
> @zackt7718  it didn’t
@raunakwastaken  

You’re right idk why I thought it changed
Biden should still win he has 14% left in Clark with zero in person voting counted from that 14%
zach you need a microphone and a news crew the way you out here reporting live numbers
Idk why the MSM took so long to call it
> Trump got a bit closer
@raunakwastaken  

Nothing burger. Wayne is still at 81%. Hasn’t changed
> 
> Nothing burger. Wayne is still at 81%. Hasn’t changed
@zackt7718  burger 🍔
so i dont think biden can pull through
But look at the counties left
it’s atlanta left
Forgot about Muscogee at 89%
Damn zach
Idk I can’t even make predictions anymore
Mmmmmi want
Fuck
Someone remake horny jail meme plz
They’re illiterate don’t blame them
Numbers are hard 😠
Counting do be hard
Trump has 3 counties left with >90% reported
Where’s count from Sesame Street when we need him
and math is 8 days after that i believe
but nevada is scary
actually is such a toss-up oml nevada is so scary
> I'm straight-up refreshing his twitter feed every hour
@bravo5127  does it not make you want to tear your hair out when you do this
i got a new computer and i keep forgetting to use command to copy and paste instead of control... this resulted in me pasting this image on my bio powerpoint
y’all think i should just leave it
ye just leave it at that :))) ❤️
This isn’t a setup for a joke I’m actually asking lol
Today alone^
They are basically the same only 3 musketeers doesn’t have the caramel
So it anyone wants 3
There’s a lot of Chinese ppl in Yoruba you do t even have to go thru me
Anyway if anyone wants 3 mini 3 musketeers, hmu
Want 3 what
Yea there’s a whole Chinatown there
didn't Trump's lead in PA just jump tho
Oh my b
Really??
But Nigeria thinks it’s broke
Nah but Chinese usually get a bad rap for being cheats
I mean there’s a bad rap yea more so for like, the intrusion tho
Okay so I’ve tried the Milky Way and I don’t want it
> didn't Trump's lead in PA just jump tho
@seba0972  

Uhhh it’s been steadily decreasing the entire day as more mail ballots get counted.
How many candy are left
I thought I saw it jump 100k in the past hour but that may just be me remembering the numbers wrong
oh shit
With over 30% of Philly left
dems dont need georgia or nc though correct?
> @anjalir519 call me sadistic but I think it's hilarious watching him freak out over "fake votes" after prematurely declaring victory
@bravo5127  idk how sadistic it is just hilarious
Nevada really just said ehhh Fuck it we won’t count today
No they haven’t
They have stated they aren’t counting votes all day today
they aren’t? why?
I have Biden winning PA by ~145k based on votes left in PA
Apparently Nevada and AZ announcing at 9EST?
oh my
Idk if that’s confirmed but that’s a rumor circulating
Biden needs to win any combination of 2 states to clinch the presidency
> Biden needs to win any combination of 2 states to clinch the presidency
@nobelium19  or PA I think right?
LMAOO tons of trumps tweets are being flagged by Twitter by spreading wrong information about the election
The Donald needs to win PA and 3 other states
> The Donald needs to win PA and 3 other states
@nobelium19  he has 3 paths to victory and Biden has 9
PA is the state I feel Safest about for Dems to be honest
Barbara going rogue now that she isn't head of case
As of 20 minutes ago AP says they haven’t called Michigan yet
> I think Georgia goes red
@toomanyzs  

It’s gonna be reallllly close
*ahem*
this server is gonna lose a level
Who gave it to you last time
It looks like trump can't win Michigan mathematically
NV, AZ and GA are gonna be stupidly close
i dont mean to get TOO political here
oof ouch i’m uncomfortable
“biden needs some WAP (Wisconsin, Arizona, Pensilvania)”
He just needs nevada
Bruh Nevada is so close I’m gonna lose it
Arizona isn’t over either
It says that with 84% votes in Biden’s getting AZ
I guess the results I’m looking at are too slow ifk
*I don’t know
Those last 16% votes are all in person for Arizona and they are going drastically for Trump.
> 271-264
@sprinkles2108 i think ur missing a few in this number lol if he got 271 biden would end with 267
But even I was confused on how that wasn’t adding up
> Those last 16% votes are all in person for Arizona and they are going drastically for Trump.
@joyousmischief  

Half of them are early ballots. Anyone calling AZ for either candidate as of now is being biased
My fridge has turned from a place to hold food into a funhouse of drinks
I don’t wanna use my canned drinks and leftover juice boxes until the last week when I don’t wanna wash anymore jars
only 3ish weeks 2 go
I keep confusing myself Bc the last day of clinicals is next week, but there’s still school after that smh
ye, next monday is the start of the 3 weeks till we leave
damn clinicals end super early
Apparently we hit the required hours
Which is confusing Bc during a normal semester when would we have stopped??
to make it b a bit longer
Might’ve taken the last one tho lol
damn nevada needs to hurry up already
They just said an hour ago that they're waiting until tomorrow
There's a possibility, michigan and wisconsin were all red and turned blue
I just hate that this election is dragged out, the news anchors need a rest lol
> I just hate that this election is dragged out, the news anchors need a rest lol
@nobelium19  would rather this than have the mail ins not be counted
Jeez is it that hard to do
Blame the republicans who said do not count the mail-in ballots early✨
Our county's school levy didn't pass btw, big F in the chat for that
i dont work for free u know this
except its not post, cuz we have to do more with it soon
oh nov 2016
gotcha didn't I?
@joyousmischief those Maricopa numbers might’ve just ended Trump’s re-election bud
I think Arizona will be mega close
Pennsylvania I have no idea because so many rural counties are already in but there are still plenty left in Philly, surrounding philly, and Pitt
% for counties doesn't mean % of votes, it means amount of precincts reporting in, and it stands to reason that the bigger precincts have more votes, and thus a longer time to count
So I really don't know
So if he can get 43 ish, which is what he's averaging in rural counties left, he has AZ secure.
I think Nevada will be too close, as will GA, and NC. PA will be the deciding factor
Won't biden win nevada
Hmmmm we don’t know exactly how many votes are left or what kind of votes are left
Why can’t this be simple like GA or PA
biden only needs one more state to win
oh shit nevermind
I got 9 hours of sleep yesterday but I sacrificed today's hour(s) of sleep
Just woke up. Has everything gone to shit?
No literally nothing has happened
Oh they be slow at counting
forgot about that
which is stupid as shit
It’s too close
I don't think so either
I don’t think he’s got PA either sadly
I don’t like waking up early for extra credit events
Idk why they haven't called NC yet
he's lost NC
Yeah NC is gone
Oh ye
I don’t remember
NV is so close imma cry
Georgia has a ton of VBM left
that's left
Under 190k though
If there are 100k left in GA but the lead is only 39k then Biden actually does have a shot
God these maps are inaccurate as shit
Nevada is still on the verge
New update says that all except for one county with VBM in GA is strong blue, and the one red is a 53/47 split
but you also know if it does end up being that close
I'd just like to say that regardless of what happens, the polls got this completely wrong
I am going to cry at AZ. One update at 1am, then not another until 9pm tomorrow
I never would have thought GA would be this close
Y’all

Biden needs 62% of the outstanding mail ballot to win PA. He has won them 78% so far
Me waking up early to watch an event on how to cope up with American politics: 😀
I mean yeah he only needs 6 more electoral votes
> Assuming nothing changes in court, of course.
@joyousmischief  

Lol it won’t
Bruh why don't they just call Alaska
Nope
Couldn’t care less
Oh shit Fr?
>  do you plan on becoming a US citizen one day
@sprinkles2108  idk
But everyone moving will make it worse lol
Wish that were me
but i don't speak the languages to get citizenship
I'd be cool with Australia, but Australia has shit internet
Then no u don’t need American citizenship lol
but i don't speak their languages
You didnt know what that was
Til I told you
Don’t let them fool u
what country wants Americans lol
No one wants us clowns
No one wants to become America 2.0 by letting in too many Americans
>  bruh why
@sprinkles2108  idk lol
> @sprinkles2108  idk lol
@raunakwastaken  wtf
No I cant
Biden’s AZ lead just went up!
I don’t think so
but my japanese is shit
> I don’t think so
@sprinkles2108  exactly eww
yeah the current situation might seem better in other countries but it's not even remotely feasible to run to another country purely because you don't like the new leader who will leave in 4-8 years
Yeap and that’s why I’m not dumb enough to be eluded into a dream of moving
>  why should I care about Indian politics im in the majority🤪🤪🤪
@sprinkles2108  that’s true. I don’t even need to vote
i don't want that kind of label
like i just want to apologize on the chinese people's behalf
I could always run back home but they ain’t got shit going on over there except the same stuff over here rip

What did Nehru do wrong

damn lmao
isnt modi a trump supporter?
no wtf
> isnt modi a trump supporter?
@anjalir519 modi doesnt care about trump
he just wants a friend in the white house
cause he hates china
That’s it though
I don’t even know
trump doesn't like the chinese
Democrats generally don't like Russia, Republicans generally don't like China, that's what I noticed
How come my parents never told me this
Because Indians realized that India has been in shambles for too long
cause congress is shit
Religious divides do be big as hell in india tho
> Religious divides do be big as hell in india tho
@toomanyzs  no kidding

> @sprinkles2108 wait but wasnt this just a joke
@anjalir519  I mean idk but I doubt it
What late show was it on
> @anjalir519  I mean idk but I doubt it
@sprinkles2108 i highly doubt it was true
hasan's episode was just a left wing propaganda on india
I mean there’s like reasons you wouldn’t want or shouldn’t talk abt issues ongoing especially in places u belong to
> What late show was it on
@chandachan  it’s on Netflix
> hasan's episode was just a left wing propaganda on india
@raunakwastaken you need to explain lmao im so confused
theres so much
i dont remember everything that happened in that episode
He did some bad things for the farmers
OMG FEMINISMINDIA IS A LEFT WING PROPAGANDA ANJALI DONT READ THAT
Muslims literally destroyed Hindu temples and stuff in the past. That’s why Hindus hate them
> OMG FEMINISMINDIA IS A LEFT WING PROPAGANDA ANJALI DONT READ THAT

> You can take vice to the vice monarch Priyanka
@mootdoot  ugh fine I’ll settle
To get head chopped off

Just trying to find news lol
well technically mughals were offshoot of timurids which was founded by Timur the lame, who was a descendant of Ghengis Khan
The lame
But apparently the site is not reputable
wikipedia said this and it doesnt sound great
> *have they heard of a search engine*
@howdy_.  she searched but sadly google spit out a bad article
okay wikipedia is also a shit source
nationalism hasn't led to good things almost ever
it was a direct cause of WWI and WWII
Nationalism triggers my fight or flight
someone dropshotted him and they had to quickscope him back
patriotism and nationalism aren't the same thing
Cant forget about catalonia
Nationalism in western politics is normally associated with populism and that ends in bad....
i just couldnt get the name
patriotism and nationalism aren't the same thing
i don't approve of the kuomintang all that much either
but modern kmt ain't bad
Nah they basically sold China to western powers
yeah you're basically accusing him of genocidal tendancies man, that isn't cash money
majority of the people here aren't nationalist
nationalist is a bad belief form
as long as you dont make a 5 year plan
I didn't know that
what's wrong with nationalism?
is it ok to invade a country purely because you want their oil? if yes, then ur nationalist, if no, then idk
just cause america messed up doesnt mean all nationalist countries are bad
a person can't be an imperialist
you can't forget that our ancestors fought the KMT
my parents fled the country for a reason
I like my country more than every other country I wouldn't call myself nationalist

DID YOU TURN SLOW MODE ON? GRRRRR
I leave for 10 minutes and we are debating nationalism 😐
If y’all don’t fucking Move to debates lol
where there isnt a timer :)
this timer is stupid
why is this timer still on remove the timer it's annoying
i mean I have work to do. Howdy, the convo’s moved. Now stop slow mode on here
Omg I can talk abt tater tots now
Howdy is now feeling the burden of what I feel on a daily basis
ron i wish i was on 4th floor tyler we'd have wwe matches 😭
I am not. It wouldn't be something I haven't already seen
I had a gambling/wrestling ring in my common room last year
freshmen ugh
Yeah fuck freshmen
what, did someone use mace as a flamethrower to burn a bear?
Throw back to when someone at my HS got caught with krokodil
that's some scared straight prison stuff
hell, until you see a school building on fire, you ain't seen shit
and yes that happened
I've seen about 4 liters of blood in a single hallway
you want horror stories?
I'm not going to play with you math geeks
fuck
a janitor got fired for bringing a USB stick with porn on it into the middle school
Oh
OH MY
OH MY
this is why I don't want to set foot in Cali
Oh some kids got arrested for playing "Truck tag" in the parking lot where they boxed this kid in and tried to run him over at about 15-20 mph
now that's messed up wtf
my parents don't like black people
Never had a drama teacher
> my parents don't like black people
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus  😳
That doesn't make it *okay*
it doesn't
A statement is a statement tho
but i can't do jack to change it
of that 21% half are probably from Asia
damn
my parents got the fuck out as soon as china opened to the west
> We do be minorities
@sprinkles2108 cant be me
so i was wrong
i dont think they care what gen
I didn’t write first Gen because my parents went to college
but raunak isnt immigrating anywhere
> but raunak isnt immigrating anywhere
@howdy_.  yes... he is???
He’s literally studying here
Wtf
immigration is living permamently tho
Student visa studying visa whatever
ron what's that exam theyb have over there in korea
Oof idk
Lol id fail that mf
He needs a student visa though
im p sure its not just "oh u studied here for college now u get to stay forever"
I mean I’d fuck up the industry u right
Man ppl are capping for her u never kno
Though
man i wish i could come to campus already
I promise ur not missing much
even though i dont like him lol
he asked a question and i answered it wrong, but also right, just not what he wanted
i dont think so
came to my school
or went i guess
If a politician came to my school
No they didn’t ❤️
Guys don't make Guo feel bad omg
i don't think my HS entire club budget was 40000
Man I want that kinda clout

WOAH WOAH WOAH 40k? What kinda school has that much expendable money?
our room is still in its starting stages, but i can link you our rival school who got around the same amounts room
im not that rich tho :c
damn boy
I mean that’s basically every chi burb I feel
except im not white
I didnt read the title
question, why were u guys saying I'm not missing out on much on campus, is it really that bad haha?
> question, why were u guys saying I'm not missing out on much on campus, is it really that bad haha?
@twizl_ i was there saturday. its so dead
its actually dead
You can’t do anything
it should be dead
Lots of people are being sticks in the mud and don't do anything except for the bad things
You have ur own room, not supposed to leave ur floor, can’t gather too much in the common rooms
I feel like zach the type of person to slap a freshman
aka partyville oh
yea, and even then ppl are still out doing parties
Unfortunately I also have a serial piss bottle-leaver on my floor
Honestly it seems like a raw deal monetarily to be on campus. I'd probably have ended up just being a NEET and playing Daggerfall all semester
i don't necessarily wanna party, but I do wanna hang out with friends and shit
havent been calculated
well I'm in education so I really can't be a neet
man I'm living at home right now with all my friends on campus having the times of their lives and shit and it sucks ass ahaha
league of legends is so boring to me now
I made an even cooler one in high school but never changed my discord to it
There’s nothing much to do except ask for root beers from howdy
Don't be fucking on top of each other and wear your masks
the silk road type shit
im assuming people can't come to ur dorm and stuff?
well zach, how else are they supposed to make out
Oh yeah, and if you don't live in a dorm that you don't live in then its an automatic conduct referral
For those applying to medical school that won't look real good
left campus for a few days
But if you get sick
Officially, you are not allowed to be inside any part of a RESIDENTIAL building in which you DO NOT HAVE CARD ACCESS TO A SPECIFIC ROOM
and i wanna know if i can do that without getting in trouble
If u tryna fuck or wtv
Half my lab is quarantined Bc soccer
still waiting to see if shit happens
Well it wasn't us
not yet, i feel fine and my brown parents refuse to go get tested because they're "fine"
Last night
imagine seing ur RA? couldnt be me
No it wasn't last night
And I didn't yell at them
Someone was eating, I was doing my bio homework in the corner lol
I don't really understand why any freshmen actually decided to live on campus
living at home sucks man
everyones gone
can suck
nothing to do
doesn't mean you can't social distance
Oh my bad, I wasn't really paying attention, but I also wasn't eating
zach, come on over to smith then, we need some bonking for all the ppl parting all the time
no idea yet, still gotta look more into it but it seems kinda fun
I'm playing lmao i dont want anything to do with frats
@toomanyzs Don't take this the wrong way but I thought you were Asian for some reason
is there a wrong way to take it?
Idk lol
dunno
i'm in matlab, but i don't think i talk about it
and Aidan west isn't on here
Rip bro
Howdy I heard that Smith has been having issues with interlopers coming in, I think I'll talk to the RCD of Juniper because they're having a lot of Covid problems
I leave my dorm 2 times a day for food
Bruh I don't even know where Smith and Taft are
no i dont
unfortunate confession, I kinda fucking hate that song
Never heard it in full so I have no thoughts towards it

oh czech republic*
its like the spanish inquisition, you never expect it
useless as shit
something happened in the 40s i guess
Miss her
sorry this is crackhead hours
my bad aidan
and former maker of 1.12 million dollars of our tuition money annually
i think she hit 2mil b4 she left
wait jonas is sick as fuck
aidan sucks
mostly cause it was difficult to hold a discussion in a class with weird ass takes
Bc there was another Rhonda
damn
Real name is Mushroom tho but don’t tell Priyanka
because that's what we need in society
i mean i don't think it was his code for the race detection
yeah i mean it just broke down to white, asian, hispanic,  and black i think
dead
Why isn’t Abby there
i was supposed to suffer through alek's
but that was after the point when I wasn't really watching
atleast you tried zhanda
one day you will be able to spell
I probably stopped watching consistently around 2007
But I still kept it up until like middle school
not because my parents wouldn't let me but because we just didn't have a good tv that worked
You talk as if we can’t be multidimensional
i've never been to houston, no
who doesnt know what an accent is
Yea English isn’t structurally tonal
Oh ye forgot that exists
because dwayne jr was hurt when his elementary school removed "merry christmas" from it's calendar
I haven’t heard the pledge in literal years lmao
Nothing
Ppl just stopped doing it outta laziness
I'm too tired at 7:40 in the morning to start chanting things

Cutting it so close
I never had a morning announcement pledge after 6th grade
ohh, college prep schools
My school is college prep in title only
she applied to case, but i dunno if she ended up going
also 3d printed canons that were a nightmare but i don't blame my groupmate for that it wasn't his fault
which is half said cause he goes to cwru
did they work?
is it bad?
we wanted to 3d print the main body part but it was so many headaches because of access to the printers
like a bad school or bad people
I mean, those top schools r top schools Bc ppl go hard on tutor buying n shit
oh no
helicopter parents are the worst dude
ron says they r, parents say they aint
I realized that I don’t leave the house without permission even tho I totally can but it’s just the way I raised that makes me think I can’t
since i live at home still i find myself doing that
i don't need to, but it's ingrained
I live right next to the beach but I didn’t start going there by myself without permission til like 2 years ago
No longer eat it
that can't be good for your teeth
I need to sleep
Where u learn abt car fuckers
i'm realizing now that hgtv was just as bad
I can let go of hgtv but I’ll never lose my hypergrip on food network
"we need more space"
Never enough space
"we need a new house for our changing family" but like there's only one kid left and they're 17 so you don't need a bigger house actually
But they don’t Bc college rip
hgtv be playing in all these damn public places
the husband always wants to live on a big lot, away from neighbors

Parents like to do that, buy things u don’t need
Razor fucking thin race this is

My mom sent me a sewing kit, without asking???
I don’t remember how to sew????
Oh snap

Dang don’t call me out like that
thats the secret tho
and i don't know what to do about it
because i can't reliably replicate my license signature
I can, since i haven’t changed it yet
That’s not tru I don’t want that much money I’d b scared
and then when college costs a million bucks a year
and how the journalist who wrote about them is dead now
i can't believe they actually have a hedgehog as their animal
or porcupine i guess
we do need more parties
Aren’t there like metaphorical meanings behind the donkey and elephant
Didn't someone say that one state was releasing results at 1am?
Dang so they chose that out of all the animals and it doesn’t even have a cool meaning???
Going to have a fucking unipegasus

We are all ✨dying✨ and it’s okay✨✨✨✨✨
If I would’ve slept through it like I have slept through some of his classes I would’ve died
And then died
I wish i was sleeping
I was in class
@howdy_. I'm in the java office hours right now
Stupid me thinking way too complex on everything 😂  I thought we had to optimize all combinations to the highest profit but all we have to do is to order them by profit and schedule either early or late as possible

Well it's much easier than I anticipated, but it's still gonna be a uphill struggle
im still constantly confused
They really do
its not wrong
sleeping >>>>>>>>> studying

I've helped some people in Aleks, it doesn't seem THAT bad

Seems to me that Georgia might go to Trump by the slimmest margin
*Remember, remember the Fifth of November,
The Gunpowder Treason and Plot,
I know of no reason
Why the Gunpowder Treason
Should ever be forgot.*
No way trump remains in office
Because it must be fraud if Trump doesn't win
If its above 1% then Trump can't recount
really?
oh
trump is gonna lose big time
he gonna cry on twitter
This isn’t Obama vs Romney
americans when someone has different opinions than them: *dictatorship*
I miss elections between two decent people
I didn’t think Romney or McCain were fascists
Even if I didn't agree, I really respected mccain
Romney, I lost a lot of respect with his VP pick
> I didn’t think Romney or McCain were fascists
@sprinkles2108 i dont think there will ever be a republican president for a long time
OH SORRY THAT BIDEN WON THOSE STATES FAIR AND SQUARE
SORRY THAT YOU SUCK SM
I wish that McCain was still alive
I feel bad for the decent Republicans
McCain went so far as to defend Obama when his supporter called him a 'Muslim arab'
“So if you don’t count my opponents’s votes I will win”
Everyone leave the Republicans alone they need some cleansing
> “So if you don’t count my opponents’s votes I will win”
this guy is a genius
Dude couldn’t even get into upenn
>   ummm no

@toomanyzs ah shit thats too early
i couldnt even decide what ice cream i wanted when i was 16

last discussion day we should all "fall asleep" mid call
Don’t we only have a 4th hour tomorrow?
> @nobelium19  bro no one have started this except you
@raunakwastaken I haven't started it
Was notttt listening if she said it rip
Rip me too
Did u do homework 11 for psychology??
Just checked modules it just says fourth hour panel discussion
Fuck it I’m taking a calculated 0 on this psych homework
Used to many adjectives
see i fail them sooo
I don’t even know why I’m trying so hard in the class when an 86 is an A
I could’ve taken more 0s
im not trying anymore
All they’ll see is an A anyway it doesn’t matter if it’s 87 or 98
And psychology isn’t necessary for me
i could get a 0 on the test and have an A damn
i havent attended a single class since the first test
I’m wondering why I still go to classes lol
The extra credit is nice but I don’t even need it
And I don’t even have to be in class to get it
Sometimes she’ll put in stuff from the class tho
ON THE LAST TEST IKR
THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES I MISSED TOO
Even thought I show up for class I’m never actually paying attention tho so it’s fine
^ mood tho
> Even thought I show up for class I’m never actually paying attention tho so it’s fine
@mootdoot  me in bio lol
My burnout peaked today and I crashed for 4 hours😌
I missed sleep
Unexpectedly cracking your neck SUCKS though

Who doesn’t have ice but has frozen veggies
It’s 5:25 and I wanna kill my self
Go sleep
ppl that dont have ice makers
I’ve never had an ice maker
Does the aleks due date matter?
Nothing matters fam
> It’s 5:25 and I wanna kill my self
@raunakwastaken  why are you up
Cause some people are saying that the only thing matters is that we complete it at the end of the sem
Oh
Oh no
Due dates matter
There are these 3 topics left that I’ve done over a thousand times but still can’t figure out how to do
He said when he had them due at the end of the semester in the past it defeated the purpose
> There are these 3 topics left that I’ve done over a thousand times but still can’t figure out how to do
@raunakwastaken  and somehow by doing this I got two weeks ahead in ALEKS
I’ve gone through the explanation a lot of times
He didn’t even cover this in class
I just can’t...
Oh I haven’t done that since AP chem
And we didn’t cover this yet
How come the explanation isn’t helping
Ah heck the due dates matter
Apparently the topic will be closed
Shit
End me
You got 5 hours🤠
I can’t.....
Are these the only topics left
It's probably going to be recounted bc of how close it is
I don't think that Trump will ever concede
i wouldn't be surprised if something akin to that does happen
Not even his clown court would uphold that though
Shoot now I want cereal
Nope. Cereal first we went over this

Raunak I don't want to call you out for it but you're the one who's going to a school halfway across the planet
raunak
no one wants u
it's better for u to go
I didn't say I wanted Raunak to go
but u also did not say that u want for him to stay either
Imagine if he actually transferred and we never end up meeting him
Damn

> Imagine if he actually transferred and we never end up meeting him
@sprinkles2108  bold of you to assume imma meet you
Ugh I wanna come to campussss
I WANT TO

I ain’t smart either
Except if you forgot to submit simbio graded question 🙂
Then it’s bad
Oh my
I emailed him but he seemed really annoyed at me
Oh

Forgot all about the group until I saw my participation grade
I stopped talking in class as much cuz I keep spacing out so I gotta find something else to supplement that grade with lol
dude i can't get over facebook as a grade component
like really i don't want to have a facebook
And then I committed to a college
Sorry for the questions btw
didnt feel like I was going to college
the only reason I ended up settling there is because it’s a good research school, and I already got a really good research assistant spot but it’s completely remote so there’s kinda no point in going to uic
Oh dang
I’m studying remotely too so rip I feel
I still feel like I’m in hs

I grew up in a small town so a car was not really a necessity
> my group wants to do these problems 😔
@seba0972  my group won’t even unmute themselves
But I don’t know it’s been a while since word got out
We have a bus system but it doesn’t go all over the suburbs
I get the bad driver vibes from you
I don’t trust you
if this was india, i'd say that would hurt your credibility more than help
just wanted to make sure
if you don't know how to drive, you can drive in LA
cars don't move there
School shootings are not a joke here
Oh shit
Isn’t it but for you
No too late
I’m sure we didn’t start texting each otherlike this at the beginning
We don’t even wanna meet each other
clearly you don't actually hate each other cuz you haven't blocked each other yet
sorry I had to
meeting someone through zoom aint it
Wtf did you search
we started calling each other losers towards the end of september . how the heck has it only been 1 month??
> we started calling each other losers towards the end of september . how the heck has it only been 1 month??
@raunakwastaken  why are you even going through our convo
Oh

Zach we need u to bonk everyone
Damn

Can’t call 911 from India

that’s sick as fuck
How many of them still live in Ohio tho
Don’t make me put the leat fingies on you Sarah 

(Okay that sounds really bad out of context but I assume she gets the reference 😭)
i’m sorry zack i dont
OH i haven’t watched all of them yet
i’ve been off the yt grind bc of work😔
I really cannot explain it much if you haven’t watched it. It’s his first public lobby video
My friend and I tried public lobbies once, it didn't go very well
It’s so bad it keeps drawing you in
I never played among us
Its a game good with people that dont try super hard
Never heard of him, but thats probs i dont rlly watch tv
safely tucked away in my dorm like a turtle
Yeah I also had a pretty boring haloween, and had to cancel my plans to meet up with a prof post haloween because it want safe
Im horny but I don’t act on it smh
Also ppl feel they have immunity for whatever silly reason
Freshmen on south side real lonely rn
what else.... were they supposed to do....
In my personal observations freshman are the worst offenders compared to upperclassmen
honestly I'd imagine all students are bad offenders
Some are worse than others
i dont go outside
Don't you have clinicals?
i dont go outside other than for things i actually have to go to
i literally go outside max probably 3-4 times a week
God wish that were me
but fuck covid tests bc i rolled my ankle so bad walking back from it
I mean a large portion of the student body not only drinks, but drinks illegally, so I wouldn't doubt that when it comes to something like covid precautions its even worse
Isn’t large
Someone didn’t pay attention to those videos smh
You can't kill others from drinking
We need a cultural shift in both Admin and students
well since halloween weve been pretty bad LMAO
Double or nothing
ppl cant handle not going to a halloween party. sad
Don’t go to Halloween parties
if you don't have a social life it's too ez
imagine leaving ur apartment. cant relate
margaux u went downstairs to pay rent yesterday
dat was when i couldnt walk
meg cant walk
No but who rolls their ankle so badly they need crutches when walking on the sidewalk
i get really bad ankle rolls because my ankles are absolute shit
not sure, but the first time it happened to me I did need a brace
just dont go anywhere. problem solved. no walking
after that it just hurt like hell for hte next hour
Grade 1 doesn't need intervention
i went to the orthopedist last time and they were like ya ur ankles suck and will be like that forever
I’m getting titanium hips bc fuck that
oh rip
me ankles. are shit
Not getting hurt
it was partially bc of the sidewalk being like broken
I don’t get hurt
I rarely get hurt, I like to think it’s god being nice to me
the last time this happened i did think i broke my ankle tho bc there was a very loud crack and i was like awesome
i should probably just amputate my feet tho then this will never happen again
didnt think to bring it here
I’m so close to being like “wow haven’t been sick in a minute” and then the tides will turn on me so quick
only 2 more weeks left of clinical
Dunno
i was supposed to pass meds this past tuesday but my mans had already exceeded his 24 hr max dosage for tylenol 😢
the assumption is that if you take it the recommended dose at the recommended time intervals tho u won’t hit max
If not then fucking ripppp
yea but the way it works in the hospital is when u pass meds u can give them within a 2 hr interval
so the last person had given him tylenol at 5am
and his next dose was due for 12
we were gonna do it at 11 since thats 6 hrs from 5
Learning abt this is going to make it so much easier next time I get sick
and we left early like at 11:30 so we didnt stay long enough for me to be able to do it later
professors are only supposed to let 2 students do medpass per day
she lost epic access last week so we couldnt do it then
so shes already been cheating by letting 3 ppl go in one day
they confused her professor acc w her student acc and since shes no longer a student they took away both
she tried for like a whole week to get it back and they did jack shit lmfao
We couldn’t login to the emr for 2 weeks
ya that happened w us too
something def went wrong w case getting our info to clinical sites
we didnt have epic access for like 3 weeks
we missed a week of clinical bc of it
We spent that week basically sitting because she already showed us everything else we need
They’re still within their rights to do so smh
Priyanka everyone isn’t as aggressive as you
Priyanka online: Raunak don't talk to me I'm so done with you if you come near me I will run away screaming

Both of my parents are trying to buy each other edible arrangements for their anniversary
Nope
Oh they were asking me if it was an appropriate gift
I’d hate that
I already had to listen to them not want gifts from the other just to get each other a fucking edible arrangement
Wayyyy cheaper tho
since when r u owner
If they don’t just get each other a card or something smh
Since forever
no its really not
Tis tho
If previous experience serves right, my dad will still buy it and my mom will b like “I fuckin knew you’d do this”
Meg just cant handle the truth
Were not trying 2 b
damn bro u got the whole squad laughin 😐
Yea honestly this time travel shit insane
Never steal a police box meg smh
I want to build tardis
Building a tardis tho
Seems doable, but it would have 2b group project since its like 10ft tall
Wood working b fun, i wish rona wasnt about so i could use the thinking box
I don’t think I’m tech savvy enough for thinkbox
Dunno what I’d make tho
Im always a fan of sticker makers tho
I don’t have a place to put buttons rip
But I need laptop stickers
I’m scared of losing them
I brought 3 buttons with me but I don’t wanna lose them
But there cant b that many
math online is shit
> because the deadline to drop is today

OMG HE WON
IM GONNA CRY

I don't expect much change
Donald Trump is no longer my fucking President
Ion even care that Biden is a diet Republican. Trump is gone
i mean, trump still is until biden is sworn in
damn
Trump is gone
hopefully trump won't deliberately fuck up as much as possible before jan 20
God my brains dead I forget colors rnt gang related
Since when was joe a crip
phys 121 has test AND lab due on the same day
Still got 2 months of whatever him and his friends are cooking
Rip babs
email driscoll, even though she is more terrifying
like why tf do i need to put my zip code on a lab report
like this is a phys 121 lab report not a fucking dissertation
omg do you guys want to role play Joe Biden Crip and Donald Trump Blood
why do all profs treat you like they think you are trying to get a phd in the subject they are teaching
Because like actual parents, they want their students to be like them
Boutta start farming n shit
Gonna have my kids shit on the land
it's pronounced **peds** shit on your land
I can’t believe I’m getting clowned like this 😔
I mean it’s terrifyingly close abbreviation considering they’re both regarding the same topic

An ear isn’t sentient, but kids are sometimes
I mean I’m working oncology so
Sorry to hear that
You're doing God's work though
I mean I’m not working palliative care so
I think nicu is hella rough but I still lowkey wanna work there

I feel like I actually did something because I was able to vote in this election😭😭
Me too, except trump won Ohio lol
So I tried but Ohioans said no❤️
> Me too, except trump won Ohio lol
@sprinkles2108  

Are you surprised
Nope not at all
Ohio not a swing state no more that shit dark red
Except I live in the district just north of Columbus and we’re lightly red
But I’m from the suburbs still✨
Both districts I could’ve voted for went to biden
I tried to vote my stupid Rep out and elect a woman entrepreneur but man that didn’t happen
Sadly
Though
NC was so close to getting Trump and Thillis the fuck outta there
The electoral college should be based on congressional districts OR divide the electoral votes based on the percentages of each candidate’s votes in a state
They were close but no
> They were close but no
@zackt7718  gotcha
> trump is no more owo
@kaori_flute  well in January he’ll be gone
and portray the issues that they cause
@nobelium19 there's only 26 im finna get all the raffle prizes 💀

*tis a shame zhanda that the bot shows what you inputted*
*tis a shame that you can use that to bypass the word blacklist since it doesn't get autoremoved*
the only reason zhanda's stuff dissapears is cuz he deletes it himself
he cant say what he means or mean what he says
and when theres roomates they try to match you up with someone similar
i dont think so no
oh tysm
but i didn't get this email
yeah i just didn't get the email for the application rip
Oh
well i must of missed it do
oh
Sigh
I’d never know I just have boring black hair lol
I’ve seen people be able to keep them for a week+ which is crazy Bc do they not move while they sleep??
Maybe they just don’t sleep for a week lol
I know a friend who keeps them for like 3-4 weeks at a time iirc
Maybe even longer
Whole reason I stopped doing braids is because I cannot sit and be patient for that long
> Whole reason I stopped doing braids is because I cannot sit and be patient for that long
@mootdoot  my friend’s mom does her braids for her and she binges Netflix while she gets them done
while i sad i missed out on fried rice, a burger n pie more than makes up 4 it
Oh man I miss pie
cuz my mom has leftover apples

Sorry we must rock on baby
It doesn’t feel like I did much but going back thru my day I did A Lot
just as i started to do work joe was announced the winner
you lost by a lot
cuz hes demanding a recount
everytime i drove by a truck i was scared like oh shit
honestly i don't understand ppl who think he did a good job as president
I COULD CRY RN
no he didn't tho
if he did, his gains are lost due to the pandemic
but it was really from obama that it went up
i missed having a president that can talk
> i missed having a president that can talk
@mag3is ME TOO
i missed a president that was decent
he ain't trump
tomorrow we go back to being mad
i'm not gonna be mad for a while
we endured 4 years of shit
acting upon things idk yet
but at least he won't attack people left and right
all i gotta say is that i almost lost complete faith in this country lollll
i stopped the stream now
Biden has gotten exponentially more normal as the campaign has gone in
It’s one thing to contradict your political opponent’s views, but it’s a whole other thing, quite disrespectful frankly, to attack something about them that they can’t control
just out here acting like trump speaks anywhere near coherent smh but oh no a human with a stutter stutters god damn the world is ending
im someone
yeah smol brains dont do excellent work
raunak wtf
LMAO i forgot i sent that
i think i find out if i get housing on the 23rd
if you cant come then you cant visit
You’re really annoying
> honestly looking at my roommate preferences once they see that im not a party person they should give me a room
@sprinkles2108  just email them how boring you are and that you can’t break any protocols since you don’t have any friends
||Don’t get all depressed lol||
im not a junior in hs anymore lol
This isn’t your birthday anymore
they haven't decided
i doubt it tho
but idk
Trump lost his job amid Covid
trump’s twitter rn is scaring the shit out of me :vibe:
sis needs a psychiatric evaluation :vibe:
Can he just accept that he lost oml
> sis needs a psychiatric evaluation :vibe:
@jujulb  he still wouldn’t show his results lol
So it’d get incredibly boring
Guess who forgot that the quadratic formula was actually a thing🤡

@raunakwastaken  yikes you must be tired after working tirelessly for Biden

@sprinkles2108  is this a joke? Am I supposed to laugh at this?
> @sprinkles2108  is this a joke? Am I supposed to laugh at this?
@raunakwastaken  it wasn’t intended to be a joke...
Raunak is scared of Americans I have proof

nah i def think we’re still getting something
> word on the street is theres a big msg from the university coming out at 3
@megmcmuffin22  still no email yet
scared
why do u hate nursing ta's
do you think &nbsp will work for a space
I don’t think there will be any announcements
everyone who doesn’t do the daily health assessment has to only eat leutner
I dont think thats a punshment
Esp due to the bowls
I would be surprised if they went to full remote, with all of the Pfizer news and the vaccine being near-ready
damn
AND HE WENT TO A PHYSICS CLASS TOO
i stg if yall dont socially distance imma bonk all of you
i WILL drive 2 hours to bonk yall
Idk where I was going with this
i dont as long as i was following guidelines
wear your damn masks
I mean I am but still
Like I don’t eat inside if I don’t have to
If you’re in and out in like 5-10 minutes w mask I feel like there isn’t an issue
Seriously if you wear your mask and go into a public space, you will be safe from general bioaerosol/covid that is just floating around. If you are in contact with somebody who is positive, and you wear a mask, but you *DON'T TOUCH YOUR EYES, NOSE, or MOUTH* then your chances of infection go up *a little bit* but not that much actually
People really really sleep on washing your damn hands
All for industrial hate but context plz
The masks help because they don't allow you to touch your nose or mouth, but there's a surprising amount of transmission from touching your eyes
Damn rip I got dry eyes
even tho ive been wearing my glasses
I don’t even use contacts but glasses b a bitch too
i wear glasses most of the time cuz im at home
Yeah especially if you break your glasses and you get glass shards stuck in your eye ron
if you ever see me on zoom because i never have my camera on
Ron these shards will cut your optic nerve in half
And you wont see anything ron
i look shit in glasses tho
I wish I could leave glasses gang
i'm chinese, did you think I DIDN'T have glasses?
oh
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7449932/ Cleveland Clinic has a study on it. Eye protection limits spread, and should be included as "necessary PPE"
I never talk tho
i only talk in chem if im feeling bold
bio i never talk
i am NEVER feeling bold lmao
Didnt pick mine up yet
> i am NEVER feeling bold lmao
@seba0972 only reason i talk in chem is cuz im better at it plus talking through things helps me learn
i want one
but @seba0972 i get scared of clowning myself
i'm kinda sad that i can't do one of my favorite things anymore
sometimes I sit there like how tf am I supposed to understand this
grab a clean KFC bucket and wear it like a hat
oh same here in bio
i do cuz im s t u p i d
Contacts are worse because they irritate the eye and can cause you to touch it more, and also only cover the pupil and iris, whereas the mucosa of the eye is more in the inferior part, closer to the tear ducts
> raunak you're awake?
@sprinkles2108 I had gone to sleep but now I’m awake for some reason

I cant sleep rn
Idk why
shoot i should go back to studying
I didn't get an email either
i hate myself for being this distracted
> i hate myself for being this distracted
@sprinkles2108  dw I hate you too
~~cancelling sports activities would solve our problems better than sending everyone home~~
~~Also marching band was in person (~55 people) since August and we never had a single case ~~
Howdy don't
I haven't heard anything from my bosses, nor has there been anything in the all RA groupchat
in addition, they announced yesterday (?) or a couple of days ago that they will be providing exit testing, which means they've already purchased a ton of tests, and prepared themselves for this to go on in the coming weeks
i dunno man, i just wanna be able to come to campus next semester
when other schools haven't been with thousands of cases
Based upon the fact that exposures come from extracurricular and recreational activities, going full remote would exacerbate the problem because people would be even moreso starving for interaction. Sports really are in danger though. Across the country sports are sources of outbreaks. University of Wisconsin has 22 + positive cases, and have had to cancel at least 2 games as a result, the star QB of Clemson has been sidelined after he was a champion of bringing sports back, none of the coaches or assistants wear their masks properly in any way. Many schools have had games rescheduled or cancelled spanning D1-D3
Yeah he was out for 2 weeks and they lost to Notre Dame as a result
i mean didn't they already cancel the games
trevor lawrence looks hot as hell no cap
Look at Justin Turner of the dodgers who had a positive confirmed test and still ran onto the field after the world series and jumped around hugging people
Cam Newton needs some disease that fixes his instagram captions
why do we not have a crying emote
cam newton aint even doing so hot this season
d̸̡̂ì̸̺d̴̮͒ ̸̀͒i̶̱͛t̷̓́ ̵̨̔w̵͔̌ō̸̡ŕ̸̅k̵͌̽?̷͉̈́

@chandachan I just realized, that wasn't for the AAA thing but it was for another raffle

Maybe it still b zoomin to u

Hungry
Well jolly closed till noon Wednesday
how is it that jolly scholar was closed twice
Jolly being closed sucks, but literally everyone goes there, so its not surprising they close down
They’ll be open just in time for me working at ksl tho :naenae:
Unless they close again cuz sporty ppl breaking quarentine
Well they won’t close back to back
So I’ll at least b able to get jolly Wednesday and Thursday
Ima fan of the 1 2 2, but if they die again friday, its gonna have to b a 2 3
Bc i am far away from where I originally spawned lol

Oh also I am the greatest for I clutched tf out of my Pchem exam
> Oh also I am the greatest for I clutched tf out of my Pchem exam
@toomanyzs  Zach there are unlucky people on this server who can barely understand one bio module
rip all off-campus people
remember the last person who bragged about smoking a class 👀
And good god why didn’t anyone tell me that I’ve been playing mincecraft for like 3 hours
Bruh I wish I could play Minecraft right now
Lmao priyanka we couldn’t bring clifford sadly
Cwru doesn’t deserve him
No college deserves him
and then there's me who doesn't even play minecraft
I’m so sad I didn’t play hvz as much as I wanted to
Also i suck at Minecraft I wouldn’t b much help lol
oh HvZ
i think i got taken out day 2 last year
and it wasn't for lack of trying to get away either
mag i can't tell a soul who it is
Dang that’s so far away
but till then i have a lotta shit to do for it
i stg if you say billie elish, i;m gonna shank someone

covid tho
so we can't line dance
Aw shit colorssss
mag u just out here with all the wrong opinions today
i'm sorry who the fuck said country
I listened to country music for 8 hours a day for 4 months when I was a construction worker
It is terrible
It's so bad that it doesn't even stockholm syndrome you in
and unfortantly, the deciders are bad w/ memes
I like the shape of the tree too much and don’t wanna prune it
And I didn’t even say it was country lol I just said it might be
(I don't have nitro unfortunately)
if country won i will cry internally
What's wrong with U2
only way they're known is that they ended up on everyone's iphones lmfao
i didnt know who they were til they invaded everyone's iphones
rip
jazz is fun, but it's really hard
wrong chat
sorry to interject, question- how much does waiving the case health insurance take off tuition?
I wouldn't recommend it unless you have other insurance I guess
but idk
I do, I'm just wondering how much it takes off tuition when you wiave it
damn aight
really?
I was just curious how much would be taken off tuition
even if its dead
able to do *almost* whatever i want
all my homies hate covid
sophomores and juniors who couldn't be on campus get priority
don't know what to make of it though since we've heard plenty of news
too many anti-vaxxers tho so f
because they're behind us sophomores and juniors
how many sophomores and juniors will actually live on campus tho? won't most get apartments?
no sophomores haven't reached that
@sprinkles2108 I snuck down there 2 weeks ago
without my parents knowing
took a 9 hour bus to osu
stayed there for 12 hours
took a bus back
I DONT KNOW HOW IT WORKED AND I DIDNT GET CAUGHT
never asked for it back
i never did
tho
she never followed up
except that'll be when im at case and i dont think i have to sneak out i can just leave :p
> except that'll be when im at case and i dont think i have to sneak out i can just leave :p
@twizl_ fax there is a bus that goes from cle to cbus
lame theres no train
sucks
cbus needs a train imma be honest
still months away tho
sad
i used RTA all the time last year
you can't compare chicago with cbus
you can compare chicago with la or nyc tho
never been to either
and then REAL shit in other spots
cbus doesn't even have a train system SMHHHHHHH
AND WE NEED ONE
I just want to go live in Zurich
UGH
oh f
they really need to advertise it better
counting down the days til cbus gets a train system
idk how many days
I really want an easier way to get to target
since my parents didn't let me get my license until senior year of hs
that doesn't involve getting in a bus at 9:15 on a saturday
i still don't have a license
oh
(I never have, thought I should make that clear)
oh
but i haven't been able to get a test (for obvious reasons)
i dunno man, i didn't get a permit until I was 18
cuz ik some ppl who did that
@sprinkles2108 i pinged cuz i knew a certain someone was gonna delete it
so you didn't delete it
no i didn't
just go till you dont hear poppin no more
maybe it's just my dorm's microwave idk
I'm very sorry
i lived in hitchcock last year
That's probably the worst dorm
boo
bot bad

i get the feeling that pride in virginity was made by proto-incels
lmao i lost the game, i def remember
zach i've lost since day one
I'm the third lowest of my friend group because one person got into some hard drugs and some crackhead shit 😦
Haven't really talked to her in 2 years though

Bruh y’all crying over 105 smh
im so sleepy
omg Raunak we get it

Never ❤️
cs is for those who are lost
> cs is for those who are lost
@sprinkles2108  bruh
so if you're sick
I can't afford that
I SHOULD STUDY BIO AND CHEM KJSDHFOIDBVIDPIYGEQW[YIGD
Pri is crying rn
jk I can't afford a coffin
broke vibes
wait our lowest exam doesnt get dropped in bio right
cuz ik it does in chem
you can't call yourself dumb and understand M4-M7 :thonk:
> you can't call yourself dumb and understand M4-M7 :thonk:
@seba0972 dude i grinded so hard for that exam and while i did improve from E1 it was not the score i wanted
i still dont get any bio
i forgot it all
vote should i sleep since im hella tired or do i power through my sleepiness
I haven't seen a 96 on a test at all this year
So it was still a 91 or 92 then
Jim took E1 and punched us in the throat with it
i cant rn
but seriously im not thriving rn
dude im not getting an A on this upcoming bio exam
im actually very scared
i was more confident last time
do i tho
ya boi here hasn't gotten an A on either bio exam
> ya boi here hasn't gotten an A on either bio exam
@seba0972 neither have i
Nothing to see here
Damn he’s still going
couldn't be me
they don't go easy at all
I've been busting out this project for ~10 hours and I'm getting closer to completion
> the bio TA's wrecked my self-esteem in hw man
@sprinkles2108 Getting HW grades for that class is basically rolling a pair of dice. All your homework grade says is whether you were lucky or not
Alr I'm turning in for the night, didn't finish the project but I got a lot of work done, on track to finish this on Wednesday
Then I can finally study for my stupid exams smh
Damn bro
I wish i was smort
@mag3is lmao i'm actually nocturnal you can't even come close to beating my record
sorry
I’m doing maths
I have a sad life
i say this as a possible ex math major
Sorry I’m not cool like y’all
The only good math major
Why would anyone wanna watch a bunch of stupid animals
becuz putting a phone infront of their face is ez
and parenting is hard
many ppl dont have telly
i dont
and didnt for much of growing up
no wonder youtube's gone mad about child videos
where's big brain nobel i need some neergy
HOW HARD IS IT TO FIND A SPACE TO HANG OUT ELSEWHERE
I ain’t a stalker I just see what’s going on online
Ok fair
Which also goes to show that there’s no shame at all
I wish I could bonk people but I’m too far away from campus to do that
> She got some thicc binoculars in columbus
@addat  I wish
@addat You're doing the lord's work
but utech says BAD
Dw if you need suggestions I can give some
i came up with one i just didn't think it would be that strict
like whose gonna want to get into my precious case.edu account
mine is a whole ass novel
Utech ate that shit up, said it was *super strong*
Russians can’t hack that they’re too scared
They can’t hack that either
Means school wasn’t a waste
We really are clowns aren’t we
too many people hanging out in large groups without masks
i don't understand how people can do that
i feel very exposed w/o a mask
it feels weird and wrong not wearing a mask outside my room
The worst offenders r the sports ppl, the football field is full of ppl with no masks
but yeah, they needs to shut down the bball courts and volleyball courts
Nah, athletics suc cuz im lazy
Rona is just me being :angery: at those who aint following da rules
They just havent done it yet
I feel like I have work to do but I double checked and I don’t
-8ball am I gonna fail this chem exam
Oh?
I don’t remember
-8ball will I do well on the bio exam
I DONT REMEMBER
I was so sleepy
I don’t do shit on Tuesdays except for my lab n clinical
Ate both
I’m stressing about my exams🤠
I think I’m not feeling the stress of exams bc of how constant tests and quizzes are for me
I’m having at least one major test every two weeks, but the classes have been alternating lately so I’ve had a major test once a week
i have major exams like every 3 weeks or so
the only constant thing i have is a math quiz which is weekly
these math quizzes keep me on my toes
i do fall on my face occasionally tho
for me bio and chem stress me out to the point where i don't have time to stress out about math and im just like F
Sad tho cuz last day of clinical
aw man
@mag3is i ain't playing mineshit
aint nobody messing with jenijn
just give yourself like 15 mins before the exam so you don't kill your brain
no if you took a nap 15 minutes before the exam and you did an all-nighter you finna wake up at 8 pm
i meant just don't study during that time
i would play valorant but I can't pause it
Because even breaks don't get you out of quarantine
~~they're not doing anything wrong atm lol~~
If there is more than one (1) person in the room, it is wrong
they existing in same room tho
I'm also wildly curious about all of these faculty and staff testing positive but I haven't heard of any departments or leutner or anything being shut down
also
don't wanna jinx but
~~tink has not closed yet, i'm surprised~~
Yes, but  starting yesterday, we are 2 weeks out from leaving
i can technically leave
guess i can't bring guests over winter break then
rip
iccc
~~someone in the math rec said it might be~~
ikr howdy
sad
hopefully we don’t have a government overthrow
~~ur not allowed to come till u show us evidence that u got tested~~ or sth
dunno how that might work tho
why am i getting insulted after having done nothing
90% and trump had nothing to do with it
Vladimir Putin already announced a vaccine months ago
a spoon full of vodka makes the rona go bye bye, the rona go bye bye
They're already doing them at my Dad's hospital
He told me "There is nothing in that tube that will be worse than what Covid will do to me"
given they dont mandate normal vaccines
like it’s not the flu
case doesnt
Don't you get that shot when you're an infant?
I think I got them all except Tuberculosis
And I didn't even have to google
i need to get some shots 👀
I don't think you get BCG in the US
that bitch hurts
That's some shit you do not one
want
i have a feeling that vaccine is like super viscous bc it hurt like a mf when i got it
I know that it sucks
~~mm i dunno whether or not i got hpv vaccine~~
what's it called?
Yeah the Gardasil is an oily boy because that shit a c h e s
I don’t know if I got gardasil but I have a complete record so
just followed what the school did to us
stab 50+ kids in 30 mins
I did miss those
Oh
oh
It doesn't break the deepest dermis
I didn't know you gave insulin Subq
Guess I should have paid more attention on rounds
the damn kidneyes
today was the second day in a row i tried to pass meds and couldnt
im so upset
They probably shouldn't have done that
I didn’t touch the patient at all
Oh I thought you meant you stuffed your finger inside this dude's abdominal cavity
Because I was sterile to the point where I couldn’t touch anything blue
I think the grossest thing I ever saw on shadowing was a gangrenous big toe taken off by a pair of Ronguers
What the fUck
my clinical instructor told us last semester on like one of her first days as a nurse she had a pt w a gangrenous toe and it FELL OFF and she was like. oh well!
and shave down the meta tarsal head
the grossest thing i saw is when someone has a bad bacterial infection
and they take a sample off your skin with tape
I got to witness robotic surgery (and move the camera just a little bit. Didnt do anything to the patient)
I could never pursue dermatology as a career
I just can’t handle seeing gross skin
grossest thing ive ever seen was my hand after my dog bit it 😎
It’s weird I can handle blood but not botched skin
> grossest thing ive ever seen was my hand after my dog bit it 😎
FFFFF
That's what guys really want
I can’t see a wound. I’ll puke if I see one
I just can’t handle messed up skin
I can’t even see my own wounds
I’m already wincing
Can you handle seeing a paper cut raunak?
Worst thing I've ever done to myself was stab a pair of hedge clippers all the way through my foot between the 1st and second metatarsal and then had to pull them out because they were pinning me to the ground
Worst thing I ever did to myself was run while holding a pencil in first grade and I stabbed my other hand
Thankfully it didn’t go far
worst thing i ever saw irl was when a classmate stapled her finger
One time in 6th grade in my math class a girl’s period leaked
Like when she got up someone noticed blood on the chair and the whole class freaked out
Sorry Zach
It wasn't for clout it was because I was 13
We all did stupid shit in middle school didn’t we
idk i feel like i was smart enough to realize stabbing myself in the foot w hedge clippers for clout wouldnt be a good idea
> We all did stupid shit in middle school didn’t we
@sprinkles2108  I don’t think I did anything stupid ever
> @sprinkles2108  I don’t think I did anything stupid ever
@raunakwastaken  we both know that’s false af
~~apparently, I once swung my head into a table when i was a kid~~
The only time I've stapled myself was actually last semester
ouch
And it hurts a surprising amount
I was putting up a bulletin board and stapled my webbing of my thumb to the bulletin board when I was trying to go for a very precision staple
I’ve never stapled myself knock on wood
Bulletin board did turn out well though
all the effort and pain
no pain no poster as they say
*pain shall be my medal of honor*
how we aint never seen 2 pretty best friends
Oh
Damn I didn’t know
no
not a boomer yet
Oh
I’ve been a boomer for 7-8 months
It’s sucks being a boomer
Sigh
Idk the month
I’m 19 in 4 months or so
jk pls dont
I don’t have enough friends to party hardcore
Bruh I’m nearly a year older than you
DAMN
I know there are people a whole year older than ME in our class
I don’t turn 19 for a few more months lol
Aging sucks
I hate it
It really does
> Aging sucks
@epimetheus9041  yes 😔
I've wasted so many of the good years of my life and there are so few left
That’s why I hate my birthdays
> I've wasted so many of the good years of my life and there are so few left
@epimetheus9041  how old are you...?
I HATE THE FACT THAT MY BODY WILL DEGENERATE AS I GROW OLD
i hate wasting the entire year im 19
stuck inside smh
I hate online college
online college is why ima probs not major in math
Can't get drafted, can drive car
i only got to go to raves for 1 damn year
Zach you’re gonna make me cry now
Oh fax
just dont be a man boom you wont get drafted
Life isn’t gonna change much
I actually had anxiety the instant I turned 18 about trump being president
and then the february after I turned 18 her sends rockets into syria
On the day of my math finals
Bruh
Literally wasting my 17 in college
oof me on math
*don't stand*
*don't stand so*
*don't stand so close to me*
Damn I wish I could’ve been there with you guys for my birthday
OH LALA
i would come if i felt being social
pls don't take it peronally
> i would come if i felt being social
> pls don't take it peronally
@kaori_flute  bold of you to assume I’d invite you
> @kaori_flute  bold of you to assume I’d invite you
@raunakwastaken i was not speaking to u
bold of you to assume I would want to consider coming
Damn I had to scroll to find it smh
how would that work?
Idk lol
TFW I should sleep but I don’t feel like it
I guess if I dressed up, I'd only need to do my upper half right?
You don’t need to dress up
> You don’t need to dress up
@raunakwastaken  imma show up in pj’s
next august, idk how it'll work
I would never do that
timing might be weird cuz I'll be at home tho
I guess we could use discord
@raunakwastaken it's whatever you want to do
I could have one right after the finals
Cause I can’t do it on the math final day lol
im gonna delete discord for finals tho
Seba we really are procrastinating our studying rn aren’t we
@sprinkles2108 I'm trying to calm my nerves
> Seba we really are procrastinating our studying rn aren’t we
@sprinkles2108 that hit hard
I’m so scared
I don’t use social media much anymore because it’s mostly a toxic cesspool
I don't check it unless someone messages me
omg 2 followers im so popular
who wants to provide motivation for each other?
hell yeah
do y'all wanna study together in vc?
~~in silence tho, maybe~~
> hell yeah
> do y'all wanna study together in vc?
@kaori_flute  when?
it's too late to study ._.

@toomanyzs  the FUCK is that
Hmmm should I sleep now and wake up early when I’m all refreshed to study?
go sleep
Yeah my dad just told me that it’ll be bad for me
Feeling good about Pchem
Comfortable 95 in the class

Inorganic chem is the death blow
> Inorganic chem is the death blow
@toomanyzs  meh I don’t mind it I just haven’t been able to put enough effort into it
Wtf lol
And it is super cool but so damn dificult
I have my 111 exam today
Imma fail
Other Zack if you didn't know I'm a chemical biology major which is actually a chemistry major that takes 5 bio classes
A whole different plane of existence
Who else wouldn’t want the Hunger Games actor, Sex Toy world record holder, Dave and busters con artist, among us ultra-Chad as their significant other
These are the audits liberals don’t want you to see /s!
the fuck
I’m moving into Storrs in a week. I live with my sister for this semester before she graduated which honestly was really nice because I got diagnosed with celiac a few weeks ago
Oh that sucks ass
No more bread 4 u, rip
I wasn’t really given a choice they just said yeah here’s your new room fuck off
> No more bread 4 u, rip
@howdy_.  

Literally RIP
If you really would rather live in Tyler
if you want
No it doesn't
Oh damn
There's a whole thing about how you
are not supposed to touch the ceiling tiles in Storrs because it makes it rain roaches and roach dust
Uh wtf
While I didn’t come to campus, cutter will always be in my heart❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I feel like I'm pregnant because I'm craving mashed potatoes, ramen, chicken, and pie
Zach wtf
> While I didn’t come to campus, cutter will always be in my heart❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@sprinkles2108  yes ❤️❤️
I feel like going to Chipotle will give me covid tho
Covid got passed around more than a juul in a high school bathroom
> @raunakwastaken  lmao imagine being in the same residence hall
@sprinkles2108  couldn’t be us 😔
Rip cutter 307
Couldn’t be me
> Couldn’t be me
@sprinkles2108  same 😔
Zach eye—👁👄👁
No I just ate like crap today
You ate like crap *because* of the munchies 👁👁
I'm the biggest straightedge omg
Partially because I went to a restaurant with my aunt (The options are limited because we only go to places where there's ACTUALLY socially distant tables and ACTUAL outside seating
They didn't use brisket in the broth though
To die for
12 hours till chem exam. Let’s go
The worst I ever had the munchies was I ate almost 2500 calories in one sitting
bad idea
bad
bad
bad
bad
I can never eat at the Den
Jenin shouldnt you sleep now to get a good sleep before the exam
Well you can, you will just shit blood for 3 days
cut out the colon
So many tendies and mozz sticks have gone poof
The chicken tenders aren't that bad at all
I miss actually sitting in the den with my friends at 1 am
and working on stuff
The queen of the Den who is no longer working there
My god there are so many things I miss
@kaori_flute we need to get hyped in am hour
> @kaori_flute we need to get hyped in am hour
@chandachan huh
no
now
in 4 mins
In 4 mins?
I remember when I got da rona over the summer. Shit kicked my ass
Time to die fro
need to cram chem for the next 9 hours
sigh
i dont like studying
I dont even know whats on the test besides like eveeyrhing
I can remember an unlimited amount of star wars facts but nothing about fucking calculus
> I dont even know whats on the test besides like eveeyrhing
@howdy_. everything since gibbs
Its okay Adam did the same thing, and like lowkey scared me because I thought he was going to jump me
also
i hate this
but meeting people online first makes it harder to speak to them irl
He was in front of me in Leutner and held the door like way too long and made direct eye contact and then stared at me the entire way down the steps
> I have no clue how to do anyrhing after
@howdy_. everything is fine for me . just need to practice some ICE chart and acid/base problems
Raunak I have some if you want to practice
what ive understood in acid/base topic so far: acid be acidy
Oh nvm
Wrong acid
we will cry together
Don't let them fool you
I need the energy to yeet actually
cuz i need to actually sit and watch thru the vids
zach we havent done the voltage thing yet
~~oh fr we have to that~~
No get that silly math out of here
Kill!
> Here
@toomanyzs i dont think we have these *yet*
KILL
wtf
i will never stoop so low
You should be able to do that
if u know it
~~that's why we hate it~~
zhanda
i won't be able to come at 2
won't have studied enough
sth came up
Oh shit oh god
It's too bad he's a racist tory piece of shit because he's such a comical person
> It's too bad he's a racist tory piece of shit because he's such a comical person
@toomanyzs  

This but the Donald
and his hair is made from broken dry spaghetti and big bird's feathers
And there are also some funky weak acids that have weird  properties but that probably won't come up
yea they shouldnt come
phone goes brrr
dont cheat
what if I will never take a drew class again after this semester?
Idk
> phone goes brrr
@raunakwastaken  

Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
i'm just salty cause the engr 145 prof has open note tests
feels like a double standard
It’s open internet too
> i'm just salty cause the engr 145 prof has open note tests
@addat i dont have to take that anymore
But it won’t really help you much
I mean if it's open internet you at least wont have to memorize acids n shit
shit
Since then
oh
zach have you taken any class by drew?
except  chem111
oh
oh
Easy ones I do bad at hard ones I get 100’s
Don’t matter when they both end up in da trash
Yeah I don't like it either but its still good
Don’t you just hate it when you can’t fall asleep
THAT JENIN AINT MESSING AROUND
She’s so bad at taking photos it’s almost adorable
Awww
Chris giving us the 411 on divorce during math
couldnt b me
Because chem has 🥰✨math✨🥰 in it
I hate bio
the less math the better
Now how’d fpb manage to fuck up class selection in a way that a majority of the students didn’t get their preference???
I’d much rather have a free for all, the upperclassmen are Wrong
> I like physics the most of the sciences that I've studied because it's the most mathematical
@_frostyyyyy_  see I don’t really like physics as much as I like chem
Because chem is a blend of concepts and math. Physics is mostlyyyyy math. Bio is purely concepts so🤮🤮
Math is more fun
Sometimes I wish I were born earlier so science wasn’t so advanced
damned if u do, damned if u dont
I think psychology prof is wrong
how tho
dont u need some form of science for nursing
I’m more confident for this third exam in chem than I am for bio
IM SO SCARED
u dont
Dr. Benard coming in clutch and letting the last exam being open book open notes so save our anatomy grades 😎
damn
I wish Bader were like that
I wish Bader dropped our lowest exam grade
drew  was like u can get a 50 and still pass
It rlly is benefitting her tho Bc if you fail this class you can’t do spring sem class and ur behind a year
Yea everything in nursing requires you to pass every single class from the last semester
Damn
So fuck up once and whoop 5 years
Damn
hooray for school
Pre med is like one bad grade and you’re ✨screwed✨ (not completely, but still)
I understand why some nursing students here are like “I don’t do anything except study hard and cry”
Seba I want to Kms rn I HATE BIO
IM GONNA CRY😭
Rip
M8 is still lost on me
IM WATCHING MY LIFE FALL APART AND I FEEL SO NUMB TO IT
do I though
Exam is in 2 days
Fuck
FUCK
the key to that is to slow down
I guess
if you remember definitions, since we get more time for the bio exam, you can ponder about them on difficult questions
Oml I feel better
I forgot we get 100 minutes
but slow down
it's not as bad as you think
This exam was actually kinda short
The last q was xtra credit
I CAN'T
But bio? Nope
I CANT DO BIO FUCKKKKKKKK
if I don't lose lunch this chem test it's an improvement
Lmaoooo Fejes just cancelled class
Omg wha
Dang plz cancel our 2:15 class too 😔🙏🏾
Apparently theres some construcyion noise
Damn I have math in 3 minutes
and that is enough to cancel class
damn
WTF
> I can have dinner now 😌😌
@raunakwastaken  have dinner and cry? Jkjk
> @raunakwastaken  have dinner and cry? Jkjk
@sprinkles2108  yes!!
If she cancels our class too that means I can work the rest of the dayyy plzzzzz
I'm so tired

@raunakwastaken  wrong
Can you leave?
> Can you leave?
@raunakwastaken  no
Aight bois cry session tonight
You can cry on your own
i hate math 304
someone should be the edgy weirdo and look into the camera during the chem test and do a full Joker monologue
> You can cry on your own
@sprinkles2108  I’m used to that
> can you pls pls pls leave
@raunakwastaken  nope
I’m so sick of you
Raunak why do you hate me
And I haven’t even met you
Why do you hate me
He hates Clifford sadly😢
> Why do you hate me
@sprinkles2108  there are a lot of things

Seba you need to assign yourself the Cliffordite role
oh shit
He didn’t appreciate it
Ohh rip trumpet
Shit I have the CS prelab due
The funniest thing was when a dude got his fist stuck in his tuba
OMG
Couldn’t be you
how do you get a fist stuck in a tuba?
Couldn’t be me uwu
He tried to see how far he could fit his fist in the tuba
Has anyone has his pp stuck in the tuba tho
Raunak wtf
> Has anyone has his pp stuck in the tuba tho
@raunakwastaken  

If it gets stuck in a tuba I think you need to have that checked out
I learned abt how useless condom catheters were last week Bc men can rarely fit them
damn that sounded really geeky
I don't even watch the show
Issue is that most men aren’t big enough for it
Learned last week
From lab class
isnt the cathedure the needle thing they stick in there
i dont see the painless thing
Don’t kink shame me
I’m sorry but you’re setting yourself up for it
you didn't have to go through with his request
Raunak what did that chem exam do to you
it turned him on apparently
There are some that require needles tho
He really enjoyed it didnt he
ouch
> Raunak what did that chem exam do to you
@sprinkles2108  shh
didnt kno they b other types
NEED
That was a plastic one tho
> Ron we should do that together sometime
Ron pls don’t ignore this
I almost said a bad word raunak
Even Dylan isn’t here
What happened
raunak hasnt given me  the DLnode
Something happened during the chem exam that he’s acting this way
> its a node on the dl
@howdy_.  bruh DLNode is a class. You want the code?
Howdy what are you trying to say
cuz, his attencion seeking hornyness needs to b bonked
> @howdy_.  bruh DLNode is a class. You want the code?
@raunakwastaken Lmaoooo
> Howdy how did you not put half of rauanak’s texts into quotes
@sprinkles2108  can you leave?? No one likes you
1.5 hours ago
Shoulda said in -1.5 hours
no, if i wanted code for a class, it would b for 1 of the job ones. i was making yok from dl meaning something else
So either really bad or really good
> It made him horny
@zackt7718  fr he was turned on
Bruh I’m not turned on wth
You were down bad
> no, if i wanted code for a class, it would b for 1 of the job ones. i was making yok from dl meaning something else
@howdy_.  I’m still not getting it
I don’t know what’s gotten into raunak lately😳
Oh
smh my head
Bruh what happened
Have fun, I have no idea how I did `ScheduleAsLateAsPossible` or `ScheduleAsEarlyAsPossible` and I will probably suck at explaining it
@chandachan I swear you don't sleep
as usual, i have no clue where 2 start and am hopelessly lost
I woke up at 8am today
Oh lolllll
You dont sleep lol
Both of you don’t sleep
I didn’t say anything
Stupid stupid and stupid
Mine's tomorrow and I haven't even read my paper yet
No howdy fr don’t do that
> I’m wasting time rn and im gonna regret it
@sprinkles2108  THATS WHY IM SAYING PLS LEAVE
I don’t even know yet
would b shame
Not this one. I’m being real rn. Don’t do that
Nope. Pull it up
and no 1 gets hurt
Went to dump the trash outside my dorm, almost slipped on the floor right in front of the custodian 🤡
and since there wasnt a trade
There’s another one
@howdy_. still no trade
WTF
Raunak experienced an increase in a certain chemical in his body after that test
Bye
I feel like Priyanka's gonna make a montage of all of Raunak's texts
I don’t have screenshots of raunak’s texts lol
@seba0972 wtf is an operon
theres a reason they are both in #couples-therapy
i would never stoop so low

> 
> Who hurt u
@zackt7718  no one lol
someone correct me if i'm wrong
isn't ben shapiro the one promoting abstinence?
there needs to be a "curious" at the end for full ben
infidelity doesn't really promote gene diversity
Is it bad I genuinely cannot tell which memes shrink Charlie’s face
I’ve never heard of someone trying a sprite cranberry and liking it

Oh like the Jesus dude that everyone makes him say shit

You do it resident bad boy
> What do they do
@mootdoot  

They’re like PragerU except more memeable
This is still the funniest video I’ve ever seen

-ben shapiro
Why the FUCK did discord change the things around
Who tf wants to quote shit that’s Dumb
Can’t even crop photos in app but they decided to switch that around for no reason
> Who tf wants to quote shit that’s Dumb
@mootdoot

I don’t get it
what do u guys do to study for chem
cry
The baby fucking dies
TF2 will never die
ur 105 tho
julia has been helping me but like idk what is most worth my time to study
bc it feels like whatver i spend the most time on is never on the test..,
that sucks
drew will hit you with everything you didnt study for
Just study more lol
aw gee
just study more lmao
Sarah I’m about to fail both bio and chem
Wtf is an operon
And wtf are orbitals
ive spent so much time on fucking gene regulation im going to carve out my eyes
I don’t mind quantum mechanics I just miss the small details yknow
Module 8 in bio though omg
god. module 8 is SO much info i cant
I feel like quantum mechanics makes the most sense to me
> god. module 8 is SO much info i cant
@sar.hh  CANCEL MODULE 8 FR
the math kinda confuses me a lil
i just need to do more I think
Sarah the ALEKS problems helped me a lot
Missed negative and positive loops or wtv
yep I was planning on doing those later bc they helped me with the math for the last stuff we did in chem
Cant rewrite all of m8 shit though
I'm just trying to go through it and explain it to myself again
I feel like the concepts aren’t bad
I’m so scared I’m gonna screw up the genetics problems
I like that stuff but im afraid ill confuse something and mess it up idk
I didnt take bio, but i actually kinda like making punnet sqaures in genetics
is M12 on the exam
Nope
its rlly not a bad class its just like so much info
he was actually a mathematician turned biologist
I wish I didn’t take bio AND chem this semester
but, thats what college be i guess
> its rlly not a bad class its just like so much info
@sar.hh  and he makes the tests harder than they need to be
SERIOUSLY
THE PRACTICE EXAMS ARE WAY EASIER
i hate. when professors test on the niche info they covered on 1/2 a slide and not the main ideas and concepts that are actually important
> i hate. when professors test on the niche info they covered on 1/2 a slide and not the main ideas and concepts that are actually important
@sar.hh  YEAH
I wanna cry
well gen-ed classes r supposed to weed ppl out according to profs
Bio makes me wanna cry
I hate when I took the 2nd psych101 exam and she put in stuff from the class lectures, as if I was paying attention to them lol
thats so fucked i hate "weed out" classes
Nursing classes are do or die
We All Lose
like bro i pay so much money for u to TEACH me and want me to succeed lmaoo
> thats so fucked i hate "weed out" classes
@sar.hh  exactly your grades don’t determine if you’ll make a good doctor
don;t try to fuck me over sem 1
fuck
Shit
physics is required for me tho
kill me now
i hate it here
> 121 is actually fine in the spring semester
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus The prof is crap rated on rmp tho
Fall 121 is horrible, and Spring 122 is also horrible
Hate research institutions

Does it really harm anybody to leave the leaves alone

Also Rake is more precise, and keeps leaves out of mulch
Except for a dump truck

Literally said “is anyone else’s yt dying”
Scary
going to check youtube isn't working properly for me
Rip YouTube
i wonder what happened
now it's working
you certainly aren't alone on youtube not working properly
Now u can’t have pasta
wish I could finess
Am outside, food isn’t ready
Renting a studio is $980??? Cleveland ain’t shit for that kinda money
why are the meal plans so expensive?
Because college
colleges make most of their money off of meal plans and housing
>most of their money
yes but in theory they lose a lot on the scholarships
still cleveland
Most of us are I feel
Damn your food ain’t in the fridge
Im sitting outside smh
Feels bad
Just didn’t want it
YouTube is dead
Oh I’m not getting Alfredo today
and when you factor in buying your own dang food I can't imagine how much cheaper it is
i'm just repeating something i've heard i didn't do the math myself
you can survive whole month on 50€ of food
idk probably like 65 USD
damn the euro's weak
so something clearly happened
everyone looking at broken yt like
through a couple connections, you know the cleveland tourism and stupid cat video guy
My dog Bailey has a brother who is owned by George Strait
For how long it took to get leutner bowl
Any connection longer than 10 seconds
Didn’t think it’d b u
i've never seen someone use yinz before
Barbara a bad bitch 💅
Damn those pigeons
oh wait youtube doesn't work
Bee Shapiro seems especially waspish lately.
Some of Shapiro's finest work right there.
like i know he's stupid, and i know he just looks smart cause he talks fast, but i mean how can he not understand hyperbole
HATE IT HERE
oh lala shapiro
i just can't believe he genuinely thinks they're being literal
No I’m already in jail
at least you didn't tweet "biden won so who wants free top" like my former hs classmate
youtube working now
I ended up finishing the pasta lol
but never 0
he claimed he was quoting someone
Howdy someone forgot to switch to the burner
Took forever but fuck horny jail
Sorry @nartha :(
Candy be making me feel.some type of way I never felt before
Sorry ron
Also sorry @mag3is you dont need to save course s
Sorry @everyone
Doesn’t sound like much fun
I’m only here to build treehouse and cry when I see enderman
Oh shit I have shears
Tried to explore then went thru forest then got lost then almost died on snow mountains at night then somehow made it onto iceberg??
Never exploring again
now dont lose ur horse
Forgot I needed slime
I just got dog Bc I didn’t wanna lose horse
My Minecraft knowledge never left 1.6, which I think is when leads first came in
I got dog
i've been trying to do it all night
i dont get it
Step 1: Open DrJava
Step 2: Close DrJava
Step 3: Burn Computer
Step 4: ...
Step 5: Look online for the code and copy the code and submit the code

For legal purposes, that was a joke ^^
Chegg is shit anw
My knowledge ended at 1.7
Whenever they started adding the combat cooldown or whatever I stopped playing
I keep seeing bees and turtles and I will forever complain abt squid Bc they’re useless but there’s so many of them
they haven't been added yet
and since you feed them with carrots they're double useless
since carrots are harder to acquire
Hate that I need same color wool for bed
Imagine having to go to Dailymotion just to play study music smh
its a hard knock life
you can bring horses to the nether, you just can't be riding them when you send them through
I can’t rmbr the name of the creatures but I kno they zoom in lava
I really don't even know half the stuff they've added anymore
Don’t have aim tho
Is that gone now
i miss blocking
That’s so sad I liked that function
What’s up w raiders tho
Have not left my area
Howdy told me don’t kill them if I want to go to other villages
you can kill them inderectly
have they added explosive arrows yet
u cant go into villages
But I need Stuff smh
doesn't the bad omen eventually wear off
you just can't tell when
one thing I haven't liked about minecraft's development is its turn towards village management/rpg mechanics rather than building up your own personal town
though I feel the commitment is only halfway
mc went to shit when micorsoft bought it
honestly making minecraft more like terraria wouldn't be a terrible idea with the place where the game is now
terraria is scary tho
though I guess that's the problem because minecraft combat has never been great, and has only gotten worse since 1.9.
oh yeah that's right everyone figured out how to use beds rather than fighting it the way it was supposed to
Damn why they saying that jolly will b closed for the rest of the semester 😔
Homies in GroupMe who are working at jolly saying they’ll b closed
Owo so early
You don’t have inperson classes?
my dog has liver issues
Awwww
Doggo feel better
my parents didnt tell me until she lost 25% of her weight
if I don't see my dog again i will be an emotional wreck
Everything so close but also far
Cant out dominate my mom
idk what that means
Guess he was vibing too hard before he found Jesus
damn
i guess i better snag some shakes b4 they close again
They closed early today so
Might already be too late
I dont believe it
@addat god bless your dog
Guys I had the most productive chem study sesh
Highly recommend studying with peers
I don't want to sleep so I'm doing ALEKS

Study sessions???
Ppl speak to slow
Oh
Too hard

Poor guy
His exams, not so much❤️
My class bullied him so hard :(
Aww
I had an F in his class
So he felt bad and gave me a c
Oh
I’ll probably have an 87.9 and he won’t round it up
It didn't help that I didn't do none of the hw
Oh
Well that explains it since homework is for a grade lol
It wasn't j that
Wtf is an operon🤡
Oh how so
POOR BADER
POOR GUY
Yh it was so bad
Nd he wasn't ever even sad the poor guy
He was j so sad :(
Aw
Oh
Cuz
Idk
Years mean nothing to me anymore
I swapped majors after 3 years of leave
Damn
I do be lame
I won't be able to find a phd position for either 1
Not anymore
At the med school
I proposed a deans approved major that was rly rly complicated cuz it had mostly only grad classes and then long story short
And then left
And they don't belong to a dept
Hey why tf isn't this a major?
I don't think it'll happen again tho bc the neuro dept was basically rdy to be formed
Yeah if neuro wasn’t introduced I would’ve been lame ‘ol bio
What won’t happen again?
Honestly I don't think it woulda made too much diff now that I've worked in a neuro lab
Oh
Bruh seriously
@everyone look at cameron's work
Shit I pinged someone
what the FUCK is oatmeal
@inexorablesalmon aw MAN I went to bed :((((
@nobelium19 feel my energy
it seems they only schedule for the week
oof it is too early to be doing lab presentations
its too early for anything tbh
i woke up at 5 am out of panik because of my exams
really gave me senior year vibes ✨
so, i grabbed my phone, still laying in bed i started going over my prof's math notes
then i went back to sleep
im much more scared for bio
I kind of wish bio had something like ALEKS
as annoying as it is, it's good study material
aleks really helped me practice for this chem exam
every time i think about bio i die a little inside
i don't live 500 miles from campus lol
They def won’t b able to tell the difference
All this talk but I already spent my lunch break on getting donut #1
it was worth it tho wasn't it

Scratch that I'm stupid
Me after taking 3 labs sophomore year 1st sem: Never Again. 
Me in my second semester of Junior year:
*still has all A’s*
I don’t know the pre med advisor recommended it
Most Juniors and Seniors won't be taking it
U want me to save u a spot?
Or really?
OMG🥺
Oh
I don’t think I can, I’m already trying to get one
Oh
can someone link me to where we can find the class reviews?
Doesn't compile -10 points uses break in loop -5 points uses @SuppressWarning to ignore compiler warnings about improper use of generic types -5 points
Oh shit
so I can't go to Mitchell's anymore?
Can’t let that go unused smh
you can't eat in is what it's saying
and i get the feeling that social gatherings are more common than you guys think
remember, just because this is case doesn't mean that the kids are smart
That isn’t ideal
Rip to whoever just left
Nothing safe about a cop car
Damn
How have ppl dun fucked up that bad
I was gonna get jolly but they closed
is jolly confirmed indefinitely closed or nah
Ppl gonna b getting bonked left n right
I might not be able to move into the dorm if my parents aren’t allowed to help me lmfaoooo
Why are u moving into dorms at end of the semester?
I’d rather move now than in fucking January
maybe freshman can stay idk
Well except nurses
Conservatives told me this was going away after the election :fingerguns:
1800+ died yesterday
*again* acting like we never stopped spiking
I’m shocked we lasted this long
Don’t come back
But least dead isnt that much to brag about
I’m leaving my stuff here with the safety and security of being a nursing student
or a bat especially. i want to be bonking people
It should be legal to bonk someone if they aren’t wearing a mask and/or social distancing
Apparently our last lab test out might b online bc so many of them can’t come
RIP CWRU 11-12-20
God I don’t have brain
I dunno about the other
But they are a sophomore
Howdy u broke me
Plz I’m thinking so hard it hurts
Does someone from @deleted-role know who is in the 2nd floor most right room if looking from luetner?
I don't sorry
I'm north facing The Den but I can assure you I ~~don't have enough friends~~ practice safe social distancing and don't have people in my room
Dunno
in all seriousness idk whose room that is
did you notice anything inside the room?
> Does someone from @deleted-role know who is in the 2nd floor most right room if looking from luetner?
@howdy_. why?
someone on third floor just tested positive
yeah Idk who that is sorry
I dunno who they b
damn
witch hunt bad
I want to report, but i wanted to know who they are
idk don’t have eyes
not that hard
And theyve caused jolly and other places to close
I need to see nothing more than the admin sending out that email and then people still hanging out
I'm so sick of this shit
rip
rip
and yeah i thought about saying hi @howdy_. but then realized i have anxiety so i didnt
Have headphones in so u never have to See or Hear
O fudge I forgot abt thwingo
Probs won’t happen
rip
Reallyy close to campus-wide quarantine
when the pandemic still isn’t taken seriously almost a year in 😩🙌🏽
America: this virus can’t stop us from having a normal life 🇺🇸
NOW I FEEL BAD
Now I feel mean
it’s okay tho! there’s always spring semester
I’m so sorry again oml
noo don’t be! its been super hectic so it’s completely understandable
except they aint
I swear I'm the most sleepy around 1-2pm and wide awake at 10pm
I live in the county just north of Franklin rip
howdy and i decided morse code was too much of a pain in the ass to use
*just heard through the door cuz there are ppl gathering in common room* "hold on let me get on my mask so I dont get covid" *laughter ensues*
howdy i feel like taft and smith are mirrors rn
unfortunately
Damn
Mines still superior and I didn’t even have to try that hard😌✨
> *just heard through the door cuz there are ppl gathering in common room* "hold on let me get on my mask so I dont get covid" *laughter ensues*
@howdy_.  

Gulag time
That was clark last year
last year there wasn't a pandemic
I just realized something
if someone who had covid went to the bathroom
and you went to the same bathroom
Just shit in the urinal
someone here told me about it when he himself got sent into quarantine and I kind of feel bad for telling anotjher person's business
Sars-CoV-2 is detectable in the feces weeks before and after infections. If its a particularly aggressive flush, and you happen to take some big inhales, then maybe
Wipe the air :)))
if it's too hard it becomes a missle
fuck taco bell
all the good items are gone
I've never had taco hell
the amount of sodium I consume without flinching will cause me to die at 50 of hypertension
To be fair I like cheese
I think most Americans do due to how salty our food is
you wouldn't really think the salsa is the issue
I don't even notice it man
though turns out there's actually an issue from people consuming the wrong kind of salt coming recently
people aren't eating the iodized salt
i mean msg is the one that annoys me the most, just because everyone's trying to like undo the racist attribution of health problems to it
but are also ignoring that it's still a salt, and you can't just eat it for free
but they're all gone now
the thing is you can't look at it as mexican food
poor hulk hogan honestly
oh i do
> kinda?
@a.u.bohac

Fair point
especially when people pissed on the seat
and your head in the bowl
Uhhhh idk bro I never watched the video
Those proportions seems about right
i know i didn't
RIP English
I ate it all
The shelter in place protocols seems like jail
We can still go mitchells
Oh
Or leave county
My parents are like “see the people on campus are having such a hard time. What will you do going there in spring”
is living here that bad?
Is it that bad on campus?
have u missed the lock down happening tomorrow lol
Howdy you need to start bonking people who don’t follow protocols
i have 
but like
is it gonna be that bad?
There’s nothing wrong with the protocols if u weren’t breaking them in the first place
I’ve lost all hope of coming to campus in spring
we want it to not b, but given that the quarentine space was completely filled
i think it becomes bad when ur not allowed to go to libraries
take 0 in person classes
and get whatever food delivered to your door
hopefully it dont come 2 that
RIP
can u not take in-person math recitation?
r u not taking math 122?
i can't imagine the university is going to be able to figure something out that's better than what we've got
> can u not take in-person math recitation?
@kaori_flute  yea I can
phys 121 has in person lectures apparently
or get much worse
raunak cheating on his math tests smh
I didn’t
*dont
and still
being on campus >>>>>>
i dunno
i need to find out
and the fact they're not allowed to use *uhhh forgot what these were*
> quite literly all i've made working in the past 30min
@howdy_.  have you don’t everything before that?
nope
raunak, i am smole brain, so no code is working here
i totally feel you howdy

Spain without the spa

if i want a taco, i want a taco
but you're wrong
needs to do something
that isnt return null
wrong chat lmao
> needs to do something
@howdy_.  return the Job[]
why the fuck do you use light theme
Guys I wanna cry rn send help
NOT THIS EXAM
i need to first know what a job[] is
and adam, we dont got a choice
I’m just really anxious for the bio exam
and we cant use anything else
Adam, I’m talking about the genetics part of my bio exam
oh
drjava, its the 1 harold tells us we need 2 use
The practice problems are scaring me rn
you don't have to use drjava
but why do i need an array of jobs and where do i even find an array of jobs
and i have about 6ish hours to code it all
stupid fucking weedout classes
adam 11 am tomorrow ohhh shit
i don't understand the concept of weed out classes
> Guys I wanna cry rn send help
@sprinkles2108 same
> adam 11 am tomorrow ohhh shit
@chandachan is this for physics?
i mean i know what they are i just don't understand why they don't compete for easiest or most helpful class
@seba0972 imma cry for bio
"hey kid, its september, have you thought if you want to go to college yet"
"sure, i think standford sounds good"
"ok, we will go and enroll you sometime next week when we get a moment"
college decision proces
there's no camera
the grandparents wanted me to go to olin which is basically MIT but smaller
and I'm like nope
Engineering college
Oh damn
adam you should have went to universty of washington
I wanted to go to olin but I didn't get in
my grandpa wanted me to go to perdue
The only other college choice I cared abt was Loyola
Ron you should have went to Uchicago
I don’t have that patience
my dad went to chicago
apparently they had school sponsored sweatshirts that said "where fun goes to die"
bro, i wish i was going to UChicago sometimes
Guo you should have went to UC barbara
i wish i went to UChicago
I think class of 21s shirt was a life of Pablo parody but sad student stuff
without any friends from home
which class of 21
Sad to hear
i have no shame in admitting that
I would hate to go to a college where my homies are at specifically bc they’re my friends
When they all go back home for break??
i don't think they went back to school
we didn't want to talk about it
Not there yet 😎
Does that man even exist anymore
Nah I’m finishing up studying for bio lol
HIGHLY RECOMMEND STUDY GROUPS
the last friday the 13th covid started shutting everything down. wtf will happen today...
Didn’t the new mail essentially start lockdown ?
Won’t be anything new to ppl if they were following the appropriate way of living for the past 8 months
Crying bc Chicago issues a shelter in place order I can’t get my comics :angery:
there's no way THIS Friday the 13th can be worse than the one in March
@seba0972

Bio and chem exams: allow us to introduce ourselves
I'm trying to be optimistic
Nah for me if these tests go bad then the rest of my day is ruined
I will simply (*mentally*) pass away
the land of the mental dead
My career is really gonna fall apart today isn’t it
*oh gosh*
mine can't
I need that honestly
half of us boutta end up looking like Tyrone Biggums after this semester
If Bader gives us genetics problems on the exam that were harder than the ones on the practice exam I will cry
So yeah I will cry for sure today
rip
And also eating/drinking everything left in my fridge
Wish me luck
still got a week tho
Leaving Tomorrow
My clinical makeup and in person lab were cancelled for next week so there’s no reason for me to stay rly
Context: Meyer looked at the views of his YouTube videos and said that there weren't enough views on many of them given how many people are in his chemistry classes, so today he told people that they need to watch the videos

@_frostyyyyy_  what if you already do everything in your power to study but then the prof decides to spike your anxiety by recording you during your exam
also one time I was doing the math for a problem and lockdown thought I was cheating because I was looking down to write on my paper
oh it said that it couldnt detect your face?
I've had to write stuff down and do math before so idk why it decided that *this* time it was cheating and not doing work
yea ive also had times where the lockdown browser said it couldnt detect my face
I need to go get coffee
I could be doing last minute review for chem rn
i could be studying for bio too rip
I’m not turning my camera on Bc I’m going crazy packing lol
start frantically packing right as she says something like "please open this document on our modules page"
I’m sorry Dr. Fejes I’m just *furiously packs* so so So Busy
im so sleepy
im sleepy too
she cant punish all of us
ik y'all cant gib me code or whatever, but what do i do about comments? i'd rather get 0points than -20, and I dunno where the style is made the book doesnt seem to be all that helpful
> Pages 251-254 of Java in a Nutshell was what I consulted. The most important points: use @param and @return in JavaDoc comments so that you can automatically generate documentation about methods
@_frostyyyyy_ didnt we already do that for the previous project?
oh
i didnt know that it wasnt required for the previous one
I didn't think about the version stuff, I'll ask a TA later and put their response here. So far I've used @returns, @author, @param and @exception
so i dont think we need anything else
WHAT IS MY LAPTOP DOING RN
when was the last time you restarted it?
does mac even have a task manager?
Ummm I don’t know tbh
I don’t remember
Nope
> Schezwan noodles
@sprinkles2108 don’t be shy send me some
chem is a lost cause
my grade is so bad that when Raunak said that I thought "yeah i'm cool with that grade"
Oh

@raunakwastaken  you can’t just say this and not tell us what happened
OH
Eye sea
Don’t judge my humour
Oh my
she hasn't ~~left the house~~ been around ppl who do weed before
> she hasn't ~~left the house~~ been around ppl who do weed before
@seba0972  quite frankly I’ve never been around them yeah
lol who does that anymore
I don’t even know
I'm sure someone here who smokes can correct me if I'm wrong
see this is why you should just ~~do edibles cuz it's tastier that way~~ stay away from drugs altogether
These edibles ain’t shit
> see this is why you should just ~~do edibles cuz it's tastier that way~~ stay away from drugs altogether
@seba0972  lmao
I already stay away from drugs ~~but I guess I do caffeine so~~
no shame in the caffeine game
Oh no Sarah feel better!!🥺
no no i’m just scared for exams
Oh same
i hate that they’re back to back
it sucks
I studied, but im still hella nervous
writing of the death certificate
Ima keep it 99 then round up. I could never be a doctor
imagine having back to back exams

@raunakwastaken how about that sages rewrite tho
>  how about that sages rewrite tho
@seba0972 im pretending sages doesnt exist
I thought I could get away with a single duffel bag smh

I wanted to not take much, but then Im constantly considering what I’d miss if I weren’t able to come back
tbf she didn't know what toke meant
> are you fr?
@sprinkles2108 bruh you didnt know it either
Thing is tho my duffel bag doesn’t even have much clothes in it wtf what do I have
Toke isn’t even weed
No I don’t do drugs
Nothing wrong with drugs smh it’s abt how u use it
couldnt be me
I need ur mental strength
Maybe I don’t do illegal drugs but i fo drugs so oh well
CANT WAIT TO DIE
Ok dont attacc
I don't even do perscription drugs (at least for now)
It was kinda ez wasn't it?
How boring
> Dang u a cop or smth
@mootdoot ahh shit my cover is blown
Plus, the last q was xtra cred
> It was kinda ez wasn't it?
@djsurti thats big brain energy right there
I mean it wasnt as time constraint as the prev exams
Last q was xtra cred
If u have the brainpower to get to xtra cred tho
bye seba
> Does he ask u to pat ur head and rub ur tummy
@mootdoot Nah its more of math
How many times do u rub ur tummy for every pat on ur head
Sorry to Fejes but I am not listening
She took 1/2 hour xtra
yes omg i was sooo sleepy
I’m not even sleepy lol I’m just trying to figure out how to be packed and out by tomorrow morning
The walk from room to car is too much to do that
I’m not packing everything tho
And I’m missing one of those things
Isn’t that just unplugging it
nope
i dunno how long it takes
ur supposed to do that after u unplug it
Woah I fell asleep whoops
damn they really have it back to back
when ur mc result on this test is worse than last test but you knew even less on last test 😎
@sprinkles2108 how are you feeling
I forgot how many FRQ’s I had
So now I don’t know what to think of my score
because that test was terrible as usual
fuck
chem felt a bit better than usual so I am very much panicking and thinking I did more things wrong
never mind lockdown thinking I was cheating 400 times when I looked down to write out my work
MY DAD WOULDNT STOP TALKING
house keeping was cleaning the bathrooms outside my dorm
I literally looked at the camera and said “I’m sorry for the noise my dad is interviewing someone” LMFAOOOO
Just a casual conversation with my camera no biggie
at the third time I looked straight into the camera and said "Bitch I'm doing the math shut the hell up"
Mine didn’t say anything to me
lemme do my work ffs I can't mental math the quadratic formula
I looked down a lot and it didn’t do anything
half of that test was just me and the camera sassing each other
> lemme do my work ffs I can't mental math the quadratic formula
@seba0972  I didn’t have any quadratic formula on my test what👁👄👁
Oh no
Oh noooo
I had one but I didn’t even need the ice chart
I didn't have quadratic on my test
sorry didn't mean to make you panic
Yeah I did a full letter grade and a half worse than the previous test

yeah homelessness be mucho bad there
it is hard to find a house under 1 million
wrong chat
and if you dont have it
say goodbye to ur kneecaps
This house in SF sold for *2.5 MILLION* US dollars
It’s a shame because San Fran did a lot of good things policy wise, but Jesus Christ their housing laws are actually brain dead
I don't even know if it's fixable without mass migration
can't afford SF
I'm just listing random cities sorry
uh close to Fremont
commute times are boofed tho so i'm like 1 hour away from SF
oh also our roads are terrible and the traffic is even worse
Your roads cannot be worse than Michigan roads
Only thing I know about Michigan roads is that the governor's campaign made "fix the damn roads" one of her slogans during the campaign
And the potholes are even worse
What road in cleveland doesn’t have any type of cracks
Idk. I don’t watch them anyway
Ok ngl this stuff is not as bad lol
it's not bad
Drew's modules have been much longer lately, tomorrow's videos are 45 minutes long and last Friday's videos were 35 minutes long (CHEM 111)

valve cant count to 3
yeah nintendo killing the vita and pissing on its grave with the switch
i wish there was a wii sports for the switch
There’s that one that’s kinda the same but worse and more annoying
I'm so sad I had to leave beat saber at home
i had the privledge of convincing my school to get one of the original oculus
Idk there’s like a bundle that comes with the console and headset
But the immersive experience tho
i think valve was working on finger capture right
haha I wish I could do it that fast
Fucking hate AR anatomy
Saw a presentation of it last year and would rather see cadaver

> IM SINGLE
@sprinkles2108  

That’s exactly what someone who isn’t single would say :thonk:
He wants views
Since ppl arent watching the views arent going up
he wants that youtube money
And ppl wont learn then
> he wants that youtube money
@raunakwastaken Yea this too
drew wants to become a youtuber
how are we already at the end of the semester
we still got a month :thonk:
drew still serving us stuff
the last topics we have to learn in drew's class is harddd
even if hw put everything, i dont see how it breaks to 5
Can Gary hurry up his class I gotta take a fat shit
bruh meyer told me a couple of weeks back that he would let me take the finals at a different time . and now hes like "i cant control the timing"
Drew really said don’t care didn’t ask you live in India lol
i'll prolly drop him an email explaining that brains arent supposed to be efficient at 2am
hobbit trilogy was crap
> hobbit trilogy was crap
@nartha bruh it wasnt that bad
Nothing tops the Killer Bean trilogy
is that they didn't do the Scouring of the SHire
Rip to Central America
ahh shit
this the weather report
> cleveland has hurricanes?
No, we rlly dont
smh my head
ohio doesn't have hurricanes
I gave priyanka an alley-Oop to fuck with Raunak and she flubbed it
but idk what flubbed means so
ohhh i was gonna guess that
Raunak I'm so sorry to hear that, he can be so flaky sometimes
Yes sigh 😔
I don't make the rules here
Not too hard
The situations are p general(but still related to your topic) so they're ok
Yea I already know what I’m going to say I just need to find names of specific orgs and stuff
And both are due after the break correct?
I don’t think we need to ask for extension
Oh no
But she didnt mention it so im not sure
Yea I think it’s for the last class
Idk tho
Omg this class is so much work
I never said that
I cant find the post shit
At least its not as bad as the ocean SAGES😩
But you need to know that stuff
Yea I can answer them but I can’t remember the evidence off the top of my head
I told you that my dad lived there
get yo self a car that does all 3

smh, he keeps denying his big brain
I felt big brained during the anatomy quiz last Friday but the grade isn’t out to prove it
> which chem quiz? 👀
@kaori_flute  this previous weeks
i gelt big brained once when i did the last chem quiz
when the result came in
i though i got 9/20
but
it was 9/10
But Zhanda I can’t marry before I turn 21
Somebody talk me out of this 5 and a half hour ochem lab
Don’t do the 5 hour lab
It is an in-person ochem lab, I need in person labs for med school
Because they hate us
> Also Jaffer I walked by your room the other night
@toomanyzs  definitely doesn’t sound stalkerish
~~did u hear another person's voice in jaffer's room?~~
We'll see if I don't end up taking a gap year
I was talking to my dad last night
I may do so to finish my masters and to work and earn money so that I am not desperately poor
And we were worried how things may get delayed for me
2 chem classes tho
Yeah I was gonna do research in my gap year in case I don’t get enough experience during undergrad
I feel like having a master's degree is more important than starting a year earlier
Also, it might not be bad to be a year older when I start. If I was my age now and starting freshman year, I think that I would have done way way better
wait.. did drew just say theres 5 sections on the final but he drops the section we do the worst on?
acid base equilibrium sounds kinda scary . ngl
@raunakwastaken he just said theres gonna be another exam time for international students
werent u worried about that
> acid base equilibrium sounds kinda scary . ngl

This stuff is scary

good thing harold doesnt
Exams are only worth 30% of the class
Been a while since I've taken a class like that
could b wrong
It's okay, my exams in that class are 92, 95, 95
Her class is a fuklode of practice and example problems for credit, and then the exams are pretty similar to the practice problems but her exams are long
Sometimes they do require drawing though
zach aint giving out handouts ic
from what i saw tho
never takingthat class
I have a friend who got all of the lab reports for this lab i'm in and is giving me things like "its not even hard, idk why you're mad" and I'm just like...............................................................
dont have any of the right answers
Just be dumb and you won’t face any academic integrity crap

There’s a classification system of whether I need to quarantine or not
There’s always someone doing worse lol
I wondered why Illinois was white for a second and then I realized I was dumb
i think we're like 10 mins away from the beach
I enjoy being so close but I never go as much as I want lol

Ugh

Told you it was bad
Hate it here
Thing is that I’m never going to actually go over these notes enough to justify the like 10 hours it took to write them
Thabkagiving aint even here yet

I don’t know
Fuck

I’ll likely appeal to the prof if it doesn’t work out
I’m likely gonna end up in pscl 353
I wish I could do that ughhhhh
This semester was ✨rough✨ in terms of work
They don’t offer any nursing courses?
Also I’m sure most of those classes can’t fit into such a short time
And then I can’t *safely* hang with my friends
I’m me tho
I heard that depending on credit amt or smth some can register on the 30th but idk what that’s abt
I gotta do a mini squat can only imagine how bad it is for @chandachan
@zackt7718 I be air squatting over the toilet because mfers be pissing on the seat
I didn’t want to ask for permission for my minor classes, it’s why I’m taking pscl101 this sem
Also it may sound disgusting but the piss bottles are like one degree less gross than pissed on seats
Does your shower head not reach your head either?
Dylan literally keeps telling me he is cute and tall but I feel like he built like
Idk
lol I can’t even imagine y’all irl since I don’t know your heights
short
Why be a short king when you can be a slightly taller than average God
I need height
"i need height"
im short
I was 5’11 3/4 without shoes at my last appointment a week ago
how the fuck is a 5'9 guy short
RIP aidan
I don’t know
yeah that's still short
> im short
@seba0972  

5’9 is literally male average height in America
that is just definitionally not what short is
Sevy said if you not 6’+ u short
I don’t know why I got that vibe
You ain’t 6 ft
Without shoes cry
shit zack
idk enough about bio to dispute that
I am tallest when I do my hair, days don’t matter
thats sick
My hair doesn’t help with height
I can crack 5’10” if I really fluff it
Zhanda made me feel short
Zack made me feel miniscule
like i could feel his sheer manpower
just don't give off short energy
Zhanda if I made you feel small I would be in da NBA
My dads 6’2” so I never truly feel short around anyone less than that
No seriously zack is tall tall
Oh
I’m 5’5” but then Zach goes “you’re so short” smh
Isn’t he like 6’ too
Oh ye 5’4”
couldn't you just go find out
I just realized Zack and zhanda socially distance from the ground already lmfao
How cold is it outside
Cold
Medium cold
Define medium cold
Oh
I want my water medium cold
That’s just medium cold
hot
medium hot
medium
medium cold
cold
what about hot cold
So cold it’s hot
I’m still convinced this man Zhanda was on psychedelics last night
Prefer so hot it’s cold when it comes to heat packs, just kill the nerves
so like people have eyes that are taller than my eyes, but i'm still taller than them b/c of my forehead
You can never rlly guess what’s under the mask
not as square though
like his forehead is a flat plane
mine bends around my head
Zhanda when you traffic the coke from her share some with me
anyone want to play among us on another server?
everyone seems to be skipping to christmas already.
I’ve probably had 2-3 gallons today
Wtf
i want a sugar mommy
I can’t even drink the minimum of 8 glasses
Someone hit twizl up
Imagine having some random stranger over the internet pay for everything you need
Oh bruh what

He's trying to get it released before the steam winter sale
After seeing @samrobot 's progress on Project 5, I feel behind on my work since I haven't even started yet...
Howdy you get three weeks on this project though
For once you won’t have to be behind
The big brain play is to trick yourself into believing that the project is due earlier
For instance, I'm tricking myself to believe that my essay is due tomorrow
> The big brain play is to trick yourself into believing that the project is due earlier
@nobelium19  me with bio now lol
Lol haven't even started bio yet
I'm working on my 10 page sages essay

i mean like yes there's math, but like you don't have to know the math
WHAT CANT SHE DO

I read that wrong
I can’t even read
> I don't mean to brag but my partner for CSDS132 is a senior who's friends with Sriya, she's also the TA for PHYS122 so guess what I'm taking next semester
@nobelium19  bruh gl in phys 122
More like dying
the lectures from last semester are on the echo 360
so you just gotta go through them and find what you need
tho
it sucks and is stupid
hop on vc if you wanna see how my TA is stupid
but he just can't because there are only so many analogies
I hope I don’t fail it lol
~~gotta study for math but thx for the offer~~
Jenin is a shell without her nitro
I feel like I'm about to learn lore

Organized my panel notes and it made up a whole page wtf
Is that a good or bad thing?
Won’t know until the panel lol
I either have so much info it exceeds my 2 minutes or not enough
@nobelium19 did you ever take notes on ecological species concept? I didn’t see anything about it in the Russell textbook
Lol np I couldn’t find anything about it in my notes, let alone its limitations
I missed the hybrid stuff
Why do my notes have missing info what is this
Oh I do have notes on Ecological Species Concept
It was annotated lecture though
I didn’t watch it
I've got a lot of work to do as well
I'll probably be awake for another ~3 hours
Trying not to but I don't see how it won't be
@nobelium19 What class do you have that is this late?
Couldn't be me
> Priyanka's in it as well
@nobelium19  I left cuz my tummy went brrrrrrrrrrrr
I’m fine! My stomach likes to troll me a lot
My stomach used to do that to me all the time
Nah that can't be normal, also I wouldn't call it "trolling" lol
You take care then, you didn't miss anything
I thought it was just my stomach being weird then i went to the doctor and they found I had celiac
I made it sound like it happens often enough to be concerning but it doesn’t
Well, I just thought because you said you have a naturally sensitive stomach there could be a more differential name
I do have a naturally more sensitive stomach
But it’s nothing medically concerning
See that? I couldn't do that
I’m a dummy who doesn’t know enough info
> See that? I couldn't do that
@toomanyzs  do what?
Just like "eh its probably nothing"
only thing u need to know about tummy: it wants food
Oh I also overthink shit when I’m in pain
Also that you shouldn't swallow weedwhacker wire
The other stomach fact
But I know my stomach well enough to know when to be genuinely concerned
Your body could literally be killing itself and you wouldn’t notice
Nope
That’s good. Still not normal for it to be fairly common that your Stomach.Exe stops working
Oh god no this hasn’t happened in like MONTHS
His was type 2 tho
Both my paternal grandparents passed away from cancer
Oh yeesh
I don’t know if that’s genetic
Wayyyyyyy too many preservatives and shit
I would vent but I doubt anyone needs it rn
I already have a plan to avoid it though when I’m older
Your dad could still give it to you even though he don’t have ovaries 👹
He could be a carrier idk
Don’t remember any of it
I still have it but have yet to touch it
Don’t think I finished it tho lol so replay wouldn’t b the word

i was asking to se if u wanted to hop into a lobby, or if u were playing stinky warzone

I was in Dubai for like 1.5 months every year
Oh dang
Btw @djsurti it looks like I won’t be coming to Dubai after all
Because the last thing I want is
And then shit goes down with Covid
And then I can’t leave
So then I’m stuck there
> FFSO 176 gang will get it
@raunakwastaken  Lol you edited that and still got your class code wrong. Shouldn’t it be FSSO lmao
And stop quoting me wrong
I have class in 4 and a half hours
> Btw @djsurti it looks like I won’t be coming to Dubai after all
@raunakwastaken Nooooo
We need to make a farm too
Why r u not coming tho?
> Why r u not coming tho?
@djsurti my dad told me that we can
i mean he is still going there
Ye covid be a pain
Ye trends are looking p bad
yea they'll just ask you when was the last time you went outside india
i didnt even know we had to get our high school final transcript
> i didnt even know we had to get our high school final transcript
@raunakwastaken Lmaoooooo
Damn
Thats sick
i couldnt answer a lot of things
idk?
US needs our money
> US needs our money
@raunakwastaken True dat
i gotta work on my 2 min speech thing
Yeah tbh without immigrants this country would be in shambles
Now i can work on my shitty essay
Cant force them to take it but they better stay out of the way
impossible, they'd never do something that benefits poor ppl
Which is annoying
I just logged in on my phone
ugh im slowly watching the good sages go
Also my sages prof didn’t lift my hold :angery:
Even though he lifted several of them
I'm so upset
scary cause the class is based off group work
Can’t believe I got called a simp for not wanting me n the homies to die 😔
SIS just doesn't work on this computer I guess
But i'm still mad because I am the only one enrolled in 322 and I haven't been granted permission for 338 yet and I'm going to see that professor in uh 30 minutes
Only 4 people in my sages kinda nervous it won’t happen
Also me will not graduate without that class
because im worried that can happen in a class i want
I want to b done by sophomore year
I will personally bonk the upperclassmen who enrol for the sages I want
sages aint gonna b cancelled
everyone needs those
not if theres not enough ppl
ron, u do realize, the majority of ppl havent registered yet
Guys how did the j-term soci 101 initially have 60 seats and with 21 people registered there’s only 19 seats left
But I feel like the class in general isn’t something ppl will b rushing to
so 50% havent done so yet
so a lot of classes go bye bye
and everyone needs sages
freshman dont get sages usually
Ugh
like under diff name idk sometimes that effects the class numbers
And apparently classes have waitlists if they’re filled up
So even if Ron dropped soci 101 for me I don’t know if i can even get into it
I may just have to say goodbye to soci 101 for j term lol
do u need it for a requirement or something?
Now I want to build a shed😳
Oh
> Fish bio
@toomanyzs i cant say if thats /s
theres an entire class on fishe?
Didn't understand the ones in Hindi obviously
They were good but in the last few years they’ve been bad imo
Oh it’s not a sages rip
LOL her dad didn't like her dating a white boy so he watched it with us
Oh rip
> LOL her dad didn't like her dating a white boy so he watched it with us
@toomanyzs bruh😂
It’s sad
Oh yeahhh
aww
Aw
She wasn't the issue, it was her parents lmao
Zach you gotta find a brown girl with liberal parents
Parents ruin everything smh

My parents are chill with anybody so I'm lucky

Idk about my parents I never asked them
people here wont even allow marrying other indians from different background lol
> people here wont even allow marrying other indians from different background lol
@raunakwastaken  this is v v true
Which is sad
I knew some folks who were northern indian who said some really awful things about a southern indian girl their friend was dating
Damn Priyanka beat me to it
zach have you tried going to the UISA meeting? im sure you'll find someone
> Damn Priyanka beat me to it
@toomanyzs I do be speed
That does seem a little sus
I understand why North Indians wanna stay within their region (cultural similarities, etc) but I don’t like how we shit on South Indians
> To be fair I make fun of Southern white people basically all the time
@toomanyzs  not in an offensive way though right?
When I went for diversity night I ate many foods from many cultural clubs
Never happens
yea, ur just stuck w/ raunak
imagine finding someone . couldnt be me
Why can't that girls dad be okay with me
Dating jokes are annoying
sigh
ron leave dylan and come to me
Never

But who truly wants to Think
That’s how u lose brain cells
if u can read off a doc, do it, no need to waste brain space on memorizaition
I don’t memorize intentionally
Sad to hear it
i hate it
But I know the information by heart and I don’t even memorize info intentionally
bs ur way through everything, if you throw enough mmhmms in there, they'll never figure it out
people who did expository in speech and debate and taped their speech on the back of their boards cuz they weren't memorized
We are supposed to talk like experts on the topic
I was in us extemp so I couldn’t use my notes at all
Hate that bot
Hate it to death
ron doesnt know the memes
I can't imagine doing extemp

No I just hate cowards
Why do Work when u could Not
Like fun or boring news
We aren’t supposed to
who cares tho
My brain isn’t the knowledge absorbing sponge it used to be
couldnt be me
I need to know nothing else for the rest of my life
All it remembers are random Chief Keef adlibs and embarrassing shit I did as a 9 year old
I feel like Yumi's the only one without a script
Fejes do be frowning at how much she says "uh"

My math was funky
Inconclusive endings are most scary
Do you want to play a game
Just murder without reason
oh no
That’s so much work tho
We don’t know what happens behind the scenes
well I guess you could join the game if you want
humans, i think john was murdered by someone else
john died of cancer
Sad to hear it
Don’t do nothing
however, ppl didnt
Impossible traps tho >>
Being desperate for something that doesn’t exist hits different
but it sucked seeing kerry die
insta ribs tho
Then just cut out torso?
Still a bit confusing
"passed out"
Wouldn’t survive that pain
more like dead
Well no the original pain
cuz if so i wouldnt know
reverse bear trap is the classic tho
oh
Pri really do be the Opposite of Raunak
skull go bye bye
wtf
Oh splits
oh
your mouth is forced so far open
i'm so bad at describing it
I mean that’s the only in u can get but also ripping off jaw isn’t super death I think
saw 7 was such a bad movie but those traps were gruesome
Someone dm me video cut
Bc my brains working overtime here
Okay so face missing
computer stuff in movies is always laughably bad
I think ripping off face skin is more painful than Oop head go Pop uwu
Might actually work tho lol
dude had to dig a key out from under his eye to unlock the trap but he took too long
Just die bruh
Boring
Mans missed it
yeah that's what happened
Ron telling everyone to go to zoomba before we get stuck in a saw trap
Just saying there’s no point in trying to escape if key is under eye or whatever
Prep for death instead
the fishing line with the key was probably the worst one
The one saw game where you had to rip your teeth out with pliers to get the code to escape the room
rip your teeth out, fishing line down the throat, brazen bull
the bull was just so mean spirited tho
the poor wife didn't even do anything
Didn’t appreciate husband enough
idk why we didn't see an iron maiden
iron maidens never existed
oh
idc the history lol I was j wondering how it was never part of any games
cuz amanda was doing d r u g s
It’s like the needle bed theory except not Bc not spread out evenly enough
That isn’t bad tho just b careful enough?
and didnt wear any clothes
Oh dang then
they dirty needles tho
they need to b tossed
Yea but I guess I don’t have *the time* to do that
6 ppl on a carousel, dude playing the game (not on carousel) can choose to have a hand stabbed. if he stabs a hand, the shotgun points up, fires, and misses the person. if he doesn't, the shotgun fires and kills someone on the carousel
he can only save 2 ppl cuz he only has 2 hands to be stabbed
Just keep killing ppl?
you choose the 4 that die
needs drama n suspense
nah i wont
But still if someone were like “ur sibling fucked over this family ur going to watch them die now” I’d b like dang kinda deserves don’t they
now I just gotta make sure my work ethic keeps up
idk if im gonna be good at this stuff
the end is nigh
2ish more weeks
im gonna study for finals over break
i cannot fail
2 weeks
a break just means doing work without being interrupted by zoom calls
Work lol
speaking of work
for what class
Rip
And they say nursing was hard pshhhh I’ve never said anything bad abt nursing Ever
I gotta write essays, stupid sages

THE FUCK YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Icon customisation is coming to iPhone
> Icon customisation is coming to iPhone
@raunakwastaken  that’s already a thing...
And then if you wanted to open the app it would take you to shortcuts run the program then reopen the app
When everyone was doing it I tried it and it pissed me off so much
I couldn’t even figure out how to do it
I’ll still be too lazy to customize my screen
Everything else says in the general app tab
I could never do that
If you can’t tell I’m v lame
What are you going to do? Break your phone and be completely unable to repair it?
I can live without my phone?
At least I won’t have a 2002 camera
The camera on my phone was the number 1 on the market when it came out
> And then if you wanted to open the app it would take you to shortcuts run the program then reopen the app
@mootdoot exactly
Better than the equivalent Iphone
now if you run a shortcut it wont open the shortcuts app
I think iPhone is more user friendly imo
It won’t?
imagine sharing your screen for cs lab and a notification pops up with your math test score
sigh
I don’t use it except to play game and text ppl
Yeah first time I played around with a Samsung at my carrier store I was like wtf is this
guys why am i so stupid?
My notifications just tell me that my exam was graded
However the price is restrictive, their support is terrible, and you're limited to even more expensive computers/tablets
Oh rip
I don’t know
nope
I don’t need a tablet tho
my best test is so bad rip
My E3 for math still hasn’t been graded
Idk what I got on this exam
I immediately spent my last deposit on spood game
> If you have two 100’s does that mean both test scores get doubled
@zackt7718  showed thought gone wrong
And not to flex on a class no one else has but my anatomy test scores have been steadily increasing :naenae: :naenae: :naenae:
> @zackt7718  showed thought gone wrong
@sprinkles2108  what does that even mean. This is a Zhanda sentence
Oh shit
“Shower thoughts gone wrong”
I have an iPhone he has an Android
Hate joining group chats then the green shows up
Oh no watch me use my less expensive and more powerful device with the ability to fix, upgrade, and repair it
Don’t need to fix it if I treat my phone right tho
> you have to have friends
@toomanyzs ah shit
Honestly if anyone wants to create an igames gc

@raunakwastaken  ehhh no I don’t think so

Sarah I already forgot my part

@sar.hh if Leena stops by during our presentation I will fcking cry
i know apparently she stopped into the other presentations to ask questions
if she roasts us i’ll cry
it can't be as bad as my 10 grade english teacher making fun of a kid with a stutter
Bruh wtf
this was me in class
If leena joined during my presentation I'd probably cry mid-speech out of fear
Or you can just act like you can't hear her, which is what happened in one of my classes, where the TA just talked over her
Because his volume wasn't working or something
yall should start roasting the shit out of this leena woman
i wont be taking any bio classes
skin tone chicken bone leave me alone lookin ass
Leena auntie is Bengali (I think by her last name) so raunak if you join you’re dead meat
Once she visits India you’re gone

> contacts sound like they would feel weird
@sar.hh  you don’t notice them until they bother you
Oh shit I don’t know
I can’t risk discord being open on my laptop I’m screen sharing lol
Also I’m on my phone
say something that doesnt add much
and i dont feel that asking someone how he is is unnecessary
cuz im doing a lab
Guys all I gotta say is that we didn’t choose to be here
I didn’t ask for birth
that's the last time a sleep schedule revolved around you

Poor girls sprinted outside to Pee when I showed up
my dad was going to buy a house in Cleveland for me instead of paying for overpriced dorms, then I had to tell him that staying on campus was required for the first and second years which is actually really sad because I wanna adopt cats
but idk how that works
also pretty sure I will die living alone
and don’t know roomatable people
bro don't be so down on yourself
usually? pretty sure I will actually die if I’m living completely alone
Also dying alone isn’t really an issue
Dunno why society thinks that’s so sad
maybe
cuz one would like to die with ther family and not alone----?
Guess it depends on who u are
I hate worrying ppl, and would prefer to die alone
i think it's not as worrying if u die with them
Lol I’m dying before them
cuz if u die alone they would think how much have u suffered b4 u died
I would still insist by myself
But I want my last moments to myself
Point is that dying alone isn’t as depressing as so many people think it is
Or at least it shouldn’t have to b
Y’all crazy I don’t wanna die alone
Nothing wrong with wanting to tho
I don’t mean like
dying alone
I’ll die if I’m living alone
as in I’ll do something stupid
and die because no one else is there
so dying alone sounds pretty nice
Oh in terms of relationships?
Dunno what’s up with the case student body and only knowing one type of person
But I’m sorry to hear it
Sorry to hear it
oh
sick

I put my whole personality into my fb intro but apparently people don’t read it 🙄
lame
It’s gone now
Bruh wtf
It’s a pain to type it out here
I don’t like my stuff being seeable
So it is no longer
He’s trying to find one decent girl as an example

Cbus can’t be that small
It’s not anymore
Yo apparently @twizl_ and I have a mutual
Never been to a disney
Used to want to go rlly bad but I have no hype for it anymore
My orchestra was supposed to go this year but no one ever planned it
I was supposed to go to Disneyworld for hosa nationals but then some bs happened
that hagrid ride is stupid fun
too bad
Idk what even happened to my group at nationals lol
They came back mad but I never got the entire story
I never did HOSA because I didn’t like most of the people in it
There’s only like, 15 people in the club at my school
And we were all in the same class so
My school had more I think
universal is p dope tho
Also never been
THAT SHIT FUN
looking back on it I have no idea how my friends and I didn't get kicked off the trip lmao
I’d go with friends if I had to opportunity but I don’t think I’ll ever
Seems like it
I just woke up what did I miss
he just left
Talks abt death and other stuff
dont yall have like... class
and i'm waking up now
I went to bed at 8am and woke up at noon
well that's cuz ur head got turned into mashed potatoes
I have yet to sleep for more than 12 hours
i do that shit easy
I love having no work due
my mom said she woke me up but I don't remember that lmaooooo
sleep for 12+ hrs?
Relatable, unfortunately
Do all the work
oh i wasnt asking that i was asking seba
I have like no work
i definitely have something due
Oh same meg
I could stay up and finish my last module for bio but I have tomorrow to do it so
And I don’t
But it feels like I do
although I do have to write a paper for my undergrad research smhh
i had today off so i got to get the last bit of work done before break
Pre meds out here can’t do much research rn so F
My sense of time has been so fucked since I got back home
yalls competencies suck bc theyre like graded
i dont care abt them anymore since theyre pass fail
They aren’t for you guys??
I know but still it’s a major that’s not common
its bc nothing is worth anything in medsurg except for exams <3
Can’t wait to have more useless work
u want to see our grading weight distribution
Pain???
Wtf
That med math really pulling huh
exams are 70%
that is awful
Never seen something so unsexy
Yikes what class?
even better when the average exam grade is literally failing <3
Oh
And I was like shit
I could never do nursing
the fact that ppl can mess up one exam and not be able to come back from it is not right
No med school tho
It isn’t
That ain’t right
like i guarantee u there are many ppl that r going to be put back like a year bc they fail this class
its just an asshole class
Being set back a year for one class is really The Worst
Still brutal
Don’t need more
I don’t even know these terms
It’s the national nursing exam
by weighting ur exams 70% of the entire class ur setting up ur students to fail
Can’t b a nurse without passing it
north corean left exterior xylophone

So Close
with 4 exams and lowest exam dropped
with no homework
Lowest exam dropped tho
I don’t have to take the last exam for both courses
i wish we could drop our lowest math score

i need to get an 85+ on the final to get an A
they record us during our exams
oh
don’t do the chegg
I swear I haven’t seen non nursing students use honorlock

its not that bad
Oh noiceee
I’m trying to find my notes from junior year
i got like 99s on both of our past exams
she writes rly slow tho i watch her vids on 2x speed all the time
shes prob going on leave bc of her baby or something
awww
Oh dang going in blind is the worst
wish they offered dat in medsurg
I am trying the ochem students on this one
one of the things i will say that is good abt medsurg is that on the exams they take off the most missed questions from the overall grade, but if u got those questions right they still get added to ur points
They’re all from this sem and they say his attendance isn’t mandatory :naenae: :naenae:
As a non lotr watcher I was going to guess 100s

Damn mandalorian is so good this season
@raunakwastaken I'm a little worried about how they'll handle someone so stupidly powerful
I haven’t watched clone wars
That’s why I don’t know that character
idk how they'll handle that dynamic
Damn
Wtf
in terms of holding the jedi ideals probably obi wan
Obi wan is ❤️
Oh ashoka
and terms of raw power with the force anakin, but he never reached his full potential
obi wan is probably the best jedi overall
Didn’t darth kill windu
he was able to defeat dark side anakin AFTER HE MASSACRED EVERY OTHER JEDI IN THE TEMPLE
if that doesn't show his power idk what does
Yeah becAuse obi wan knew anakins skill set already
> he was able to defeat dark side anakin AFTER HE MASSACRED EVERY OTHER JEDI IN THE TEMPLE
@absence000  who defeated anakin
obi wan
he cut his arm and legs off
And Anakin died in lava
basically obi wan knew anakin would eventually land a hit, so he tried to goad anakin into using his own move against him
anakin tried to kill obi wan the same way obi wan killed darth maul, but of course obi wan was ready for that
He wasn’t a true Jedi
And I don’t think he could even truly become one
died to darth maul
maul had more offensive ability than qui gon, and he was able to seperate the two
and of course obi wan separated him in the end
Didnt maul get revived
Oh Liam neeson character?
yeah, he ended up leading part of the mandalorians
Damn y’all down for some epic gaming time?
Here's some money 💰
damn

Howdy I will Fall Asleep

i'm finishing m14 content tn me thinks
Bruh you act like I've even looked at it
I probably could help with your work lmao
the issue isn't me understanding shit
i can easily do the math questions me thinks
the issue is i suck at taking tests
Don’t second guess yourself
That’s the worst thing you can do
I didn't this test
I just missed the small details here and there
Be warned though. If you take that class early Gary will put you to sleep
at least he doesn't make you question your life's choices
Is Drew actually that bad
Surprisingly, Chris destroyed us in MATH 122 this week (average of around 70 on exam 3) at the same time that Drew rescued many of us in CHEM 111
he doesn't lecture live at all
What the fuck
Ohhh yeah exam 3 in 122 is brutal
Isn’t it like circuits n shit @_frostyyyyy_
And by fun I mean fucking awful
idk
Oh, it looks like 126 has topics from both 122 and 223
Most 122 topics actually aren't covered in 126 from what I can see
There are so many math classes lmao
I remember when math was just 8x9 = 72
I hate english phonology, schwas are the devil's vowel
English is a stupid language
I couldn’t imagine trying to learn this shit as a second language
English poetry also gets to use every single type of meter except quantitative, making everything incredibly annoying
English as a Stupid Language
Becoming apathetic. RIP
I wasn't an ESL idek how they decided that stuff
You shouldn’t be ESL then
i said i wasn't
English spelling is screwed thans to great vowel shift, and our meter is screwed for other various reasons. I guess the only reason English survived is because it still isn't as bad as the dumpster fire that is French
Is French actually that bad
ive studied a whole other language before
they didn't even offer it at my hs
and cuneiform is almost entirely dead
that means i dont go
holy fuck
fuck
it can't be that bad right
oh sir it is

Melatonin is more of a vitamin I feel

I hope there’s a toddler in your plane
And they cry the entire time
It’ll be funny if that happened to you on your 18-hour plane ride to the states next semester
it's bound to happen
~~RIP the parent who has to look after that toddler~~

so jokes on u raunak
*one hour left*

> i'm used to worse scenarios 
> so jokes on u raunak
What can be worse than this?
Twas a good couple hours tho qq
Let’s see work until 4 pm come home and grind out some chem so I don’t fail
I’m not giving up until I’ve taken the final
Theres nothing to give up
If I don’t, well, I’ll cry
Probably a bad idea
Imagine still having hopes for chem
Couldn’t be me
that’s all I know, it was cut from the AP chem curriculum due to covid💀
@raunakwastaken It's on the slides but there's not even a video about it. I already had low expectations given the lack of real lectures but this is just ridiculous
havent heard that name in a long time
i had 2 options for sages
one of them is closed T_T
Imagine taking another chem class
Couldn’t be me
@raunakwastaken Are you taking discrete or computer organization?
What’s computer organisation?
You mean the 281 class?
Idk
Bruh 233 only has 43 left 💀
Three of my professors have not responded to my emails over the last week 💀
i dont think you should go more than 9/10
I feel much better
oh
If I had known that page limit wasn’t absolute I would’ve had a better essay
I just tried uninstalling Microsoft Edge from my computer and my computer just shut down suddenly
why is glue so damn sticky
Bruh 20/10 I wish
Huh I wish he could
Bruh what did i miss
@nobelium19 can you go into optolaryngology  because priyanka is doing eyes and I might need to get my ears checked every now and then
And also can you give me like 500,000 dollars when you're like 90 because you won't need it anyways and you'll soon die
sorry
Zhanda, every time someone says "stop pinging me" I feel like you need your ears checked
its ok i promise to actually be serious, that question was asking for it tho
wish me luck
I don't have ana ccount
OMG
I’m waiting for my laptop to charge so I can finish my bio stuff
Quick maths
Wish this paid off in chem
What happened to this guy
What happened to Santa this year
I want my pwesents
GUYS I HAVENT PUT UP MY TREE YET
Couldn’t be me
Damn the Harvard peeps haven’t sent out the recording lol
How am I supposed to write the short summary
Sigh
Oh
Couldn’t be me
You just don’t write it
Sorry but we’re gonna revolt
This is how I write all my neuro lecture summaries except the meetings are always recorded and uploaded so I read the transcript
Yikes wtf is up with me
Meh. Just studying. How about you? Did you reach home okay?
I’m so wiped tho
Nearly missed my first flight
I’m sure flying across the country ain’t easy
Oh what
Yeah they said the flight was gonna be delayed by a half hour and then we boarded early and I didn’t figure it out until I got back from the bathroom and heard “last call for flight to Chicago midway”
Don’t worry about it flights suck sometimes
I got a whole row to myself like some kind of poor man’s first class
Oh
I’m lame I’d be driving
Zhanda have you gone home yet? @chandachan
Likely won’t happen
That’d be dope tho
Ugh I wish Covid wasn’t a thing
Where I’m considered a mf visitor at my own school🤡
IM SORRY I REALLY AM😭😭
I MISSED A LOT OF PEOPLE
I wish Drew would let me become a doc but he’s trying so hard not to
Bruh there’s no way ur chem score was that bad
After the one I just got I’ll be lucky if I get a job stocking shelves at airport kiosks
Tis v bad
Didn’t seem that bad
I thought I crushed that exam
Fml
Omg it’s raunak
Damn u guys still awake wtf

:XMARK6: **Dhananjay**, you can't use that.
We can’t get them to him
Cuz it’s from Tyson
Tyson farms bad
Boutta be vegetarian by the end of the semester
Hell yeah I’ll rant about how shit the food is here
I will still sleep through sages
Then you wont get 20 participation pts
Sadly i agree
But at least i dont write about stupid concrete
At least I don’t have to talk
Dhananjay knows wtf is up
I tried to get Neel to switch to my sages but he wouldn’t budge
Neel likes to talk about nuggies tho
Instead he was like sWitch to mIne
you wont take neel away from us ❤️
And I was like bruh it won’t fit in my schedule
I’m not desperate Im the one who gets to sleep during sages
Isnt it 8AM EST?
Then you fucking LEFT
MATH

Monday and wednesday and we have 4th hour too
Bio lab was hard enough for me to wake up for
Wtf luckyyyy

Apparently the one we got was better than the ones offered in person pre Covid
I wanna work there
Holy shit thats sick

How did you accidentally find too much porn
you really want it?
@sprinkles2108 I only have a shred of confidence cuz I lost so much weight from eating so little while on campus
Oh damn
I lost 14 lbs senior year
nothing
I ended up locking my phone smh
It’s cartman there’s worse gifs
It’s just really offensive
You’re no longer a virgin
if im brown that doesnt mean i prefer other browns
@raunakwastaken too slow man
I feel like both of you are rly timid irl
Nah im not really
I open up p quick though
I only answer the easy questions so I don’t clown myself
Doesn’t matter
Fax though I only speak meaningless shit
Haven’t spoken to Michael or naman though ever
Oh and rushil
Cant relate
It’s not bad
U need naps
ive been awake for like 4 hours and ive already taken 2 naps
If I don’t get at least some sleep I turn into cranky baby Seba
I hate it when my family talks to me in the morning
Leave me alone
damn other humans are awake?
i wish
Spring courses taken in the fall are usually p empty
oof yeah all the linear alg and upper div math classes are full
i just checked and last year 140 people took 233
that means ideally around 50 people wont get the class
if he doesnt allow more than 90 to join
Doesn’t hurt to try
he said he wont add people this time
ig take it in the fall if you can't get in
i dont wanna take it with ayday
i heard some bad things about him
ayday isn't that bad
i've actually heard some bad things about rabinovich
This final bio homework assignment makes me wanna kms
@raunakwastaken  like someone currently in ayday's 233 said they had to drop rabinovich last spring and prefer ayday
oh damn
I'd suggest trying to take it spring, but if you can't get it in the class don't worry too much about having Ayday
oh that's a mood
discrete is another super common CS prereq and i want to get that done asap
rip us cs majors
oh is it?
302 is discrete math
yeah 17 seats left in 302
the section i am signed up for has a single seat taken
oh elementary differential equations, not differential equations
I was also considering signing up for Math 307 for the spring semester, but it is already full so rip
oh gotcha
hopefully it wont be that tough
I fuckijg hate waking up this early
ron isnt it 10?
chicago isnt in est?
chicago lost all my respect
Fair enough
I got 4 hours of sleep yayyyy
Was the near all-nighter worth it? I don’t know
I think it’s bc I still go to sleep before 12
So I get my 8 hours in
Couldn’t be me
i just cant seem to sleep for 8 hours
On that grind to not fail so F
7 hours and boom
I can sleep for 10 hours if need be
I was enjoying my day yesterday then woke up at 1am realizing I have 2 chapters of notes for bio, gotta finish my final paper, and 2 exams for next next Monday
But today will b spent Chilling again 😎
youre working on your final paper now?
i do my papers on the day they're due
Ha, this one I can’t
Because I need to make a presentation on it
Also I want as much studying time as possible
Without the stress of other assignments over my head
I wanna take my last anatomy exam before thanksgiving
Oh
It’s one page single space limit though
But ugh
Rip
Fml
And ofc we’re still learning stuff in chem
it is slightly concerning that i cant see even with my specs on
Fucking mod
ron i didnt read that
And I said I’m sorry to hear it
i didnt read your last 2 texts
I SAID IM SORRY YOU DONT GET
OH WOWWWW
SERIOUSLY???
it doesnt delete gifs
Ron do you want me to hope that I’m on campus next semester
I need someone to tag team
Don’t you wanna be a nurse or somethin
I don’t have patience for adults
and i found porn yet again
Isn’t the mail that will decide the fate of remote students coming out tomorrow?
OH
I don’t care anymore screw 2020
It’s still dramatic tho
I’m worrying whether my parents will allow me to go or not
That’ll be sad
You jinxed the bad outcome
If you jinx a bad outcome the opposite happens
I’m currently looking at my mid-semester grades and I hate the way chem is ruining everything
Oh whale
Idk what I was even looking at but it asked for my gpa and I almost had a Panik
It wasn’t like that for high school?
Wasn’t like that at my hs at all
How hard is Drew’s final exam typically? I know you didn’t take them during the pandemic but still
Because chem is the one class really stressing me out
I’m trying bro
I thought it was easier than the other tests purely because it isn’t really as much of a time crunch. I nearly aced it
Yeah at least our worst section gets dropped
Seriously?
Just study like you normally would. I could’ve flunked my 111 final because I didn’t study until 2 hours before the test
Uh I studied how I normally would for this exam (even more actually)
Then his multiple choice really wrecked me
Because I can do the math
But the wording of his questions and missing the small details get me
I never opened my textbook lmfao so idk😅
i have no idea how to study for this chem 🤡
slept 14 hours UwU
OMG WHYYYY
I was studying for bio
Finishing up my very last module
sad
Nah I’m wide awake
Because the espresso from last night helped
Can you guys pray that I’m very productive with my studying today
I need it
~~we can study together in vc if u want~~
I think I need to do something for my parents though smh
Jenin tomorrow I find out if I get a dorm ~~and likely I will not~~
Pray hard
time to go study kek
ugh who is @nobelium19
I tried
i wish
ok i gotta go study bye guys
why don't you have a million accounts then?
~~kids don't get dad jokes~~
then you can't call her a boomer...
Fair
This break isn’t a real break
I'm not sure if I could last another week
I need to take a me day today
@nobelium19 the homework is dumb
So I don’t start panicking
Really? Is it another concept map
Simbio isn’t bad though
As if the final wasn’t enough to help us summarize stuff
But apparently this is supposed to help us prepare for the final
No it isn't
yeah lol the notes took me a while rip
i do be slow
yeah i've been trying to get all my work done asap so i have extra studying time
i kinda took a break yesterday by going to work
but every time i try to rest i remember my chem exam performance and go "yeah you don't deserve a break get back to work"
Everyday I reserve 2 hours of doing no work
Oh I do that already
Unless I don't have the time, in which that gets revoked
like i physically cannot sit for 2 hours straight and study
so i def take study breaks
I told myself I will get up at 7am which I could easily do on campus but now that I'm off campus I can't seem to get the motivation to get out of bed
the espresso really hit hard last night
so 5 hours of sleep
I don't drink coffee so I don't have that problem lol
i can't stay up past 1 if i don't drink coffee
what sucks is
I feel you
i've reached the point in my life where i need to nap after napping hard
not anymore for some reason
may it's cuz im even more sleep deprived
Oh ok, what's the class limit on that
i need a mental break from bio
I need a mental break from life
damn seba you're big brain
no i'm stupid
idt i need biol 225 for my major
that class is rly laid back
I wouldn't think you'd need it for pre med
idt i need it for neuro
i do need social sci creds for the general requirements in CAS
@zackt7718 are you sick?
I think you only need 2 classes, and for premed it's pysch and soc?
AP psych easiest class I ever took
My school didn't have ANY psychology courses smh
my teacher made it unnecessarily hard
Bra Freud was on some kinky shit 😭😭😭😭😭
Yeah every sexual feeling you ever had is because you wanted to fuck ya mom/dad as a kid
Never thought about how sad it would be to have the game and not the console
My Plan B is computer science
Plan C is live and die with parents
if i can't become an MD imm go for the PhD
damn
I could never be a surgeon
Poke at the eye
you can perform surgery on me when I inevitably miss my plan A and go with my plan B
Anyways who the fuck left this bowl of Mac and cheese in the bathroom
Rip
Sorry to hear it
so I'm boutta miss that
Idk perish
no you aren't
Idk what my plan A is lmao
never too late
damn
So Plan B means I didn’t get BSN lol
Or I got BSN and can’t b nurse
Gotta Do Shit
I’m still tryna figure out why the fuck there a bowl of Mac and cheese in da bathroom
Someone forgot their toilet snack
Fucking mods removing my memes on Reddit

Still on campus
I already miss cold weather
38 and raining
It’s cold here too
> 38 and raining

Bruh that’s too cold 💀
For it’s just cold
Not too cold
For me the 20’s is cold
It’s 67 here and I’m cold
Literally everyone in India when I last visited
Imagine thinking 38 C is cold lmfaooooo
Isn’t 38C like 100
I don’t even know
You meant Kelvin didn’t you
I do be slow
I j realized that
38 K is cold as frick
Kelvin doesn’t do negatives Raunak
> Kelvin doesn’t do negatives Raunak
@zackt7718  shit really?
Oh
No one has reached it tho
This is why I flunked my chem exam
hypothetically, all atoms would stop moving
Hypothetically I would be dead
I’m already in 23rd
Aw man
OH???
8ball never lies though
-8ball will I do work today
don't hate it till u try it 🤪
I would die if i got tackled
Are there supposed to be classes this week? The only one on canvas is physics and I feel like that’s a mistake
nope we have thanksgiving break
IDK
if that pig is supposed to be feeling good
im scared what feeling bad is
Oh gosh it’s 12

Howdy does all the work and I Farm

Can’t make meat blocks tho

i suck at articulation guys
smol brain still
i never went through those

We done with sat tho
Too slow

Easier but needs speed
Don’t remember

cuz we from the midwest
they accept either
no, ppl who dont like english tend to take act
those who hate READING
reading b english tho
i suck at reading in the act and sat both
tho tbh i did take em both, sat had more wordy stuff
i think i did piss poor on them both
tho my reading score was still not great
im just stupid as heck
Bruh exactly 7 hours and boom I’m up. Why can’t I sleep for 8 hours smh
bruh wtf

no they dont
i dont have a perfect either
rip
i wish
i never advanced from highschool
with this online learning shit
lol rip
actually just sad
i've been on a flatline since birth
if i cant do gen chem and bio
am i supposed to do in later years?
was supposed to be parties
sad
Can’t say if you’re kidding howdy
*me looking at how much work i have to do over break*
you say that as i give myself a break from studying bio and chem today
rip
OMG ITS THE 23RD
nah with my luck i wont get a dorm room
Prepare for the worst outcome
cuz we talk about school
How the discord phone app is 🤮
i dont mind it too much
Typing on phone is also hard
it sucks
use computer
i want
Cuz I turned off my laptop 
Spent eternity on it
It also needs time to shut off
i should sleep im not even studying rn
U can be awake and not be studying
Damn y’all are sleeping early today huh
*when 1 -2 am is early*
Only three ALEKS topics and one Drew video left before I'm done with chemistry forever
The rest is just review though, Nernst equation is the last thing we have to learn
i need to pee
i kinda gave up on school where i am rn ngl
kinda bad
I should be dead in a ditch ^_^
I told her I was tired from writing the paper the entire day then she asked if I wanted tea lmao
we need real hitting tho
LA CHANCLA
I’m so drained rn I don’t know if I have the energy to study
i want to sleep more
I want to sleep and relax but I’ll feel so guilty that I didn’t study
That I cannot fail
I’m not even studying I just need to do this test before I forget smh
bruh
there is so much we have to do for the last paper for sages
My parents don’t know what’s going on with my academics
And I can’t fail my finals
My parents haven’t admitted it yet but I think they’ve given up on me
Like I said they have yet to admit it
i spent the entire afternoon coding the wrong thing😌
ron ron ron
is there a trash truck near u?
Oh
didnt have to actually code it
I HATE BUGS
i hate bugs too
cuz it's *bugs*
Fair
You don’t want to
I don’t even know if she saw it
omg
omg
Why won’t my texts send
omg eww
why arent my texts going smh
Chris Kyle couldn’t touch his sniping ability
chat died
oh anjali i think we met in the math test 3 office hours 👀
good for her, what's she studying?
I was the only one that did it from my school smh
Oh what we had a whole club
Back when I actually understood math
Catching up on them hours I missed out on from school
Bruh I don't want to hear it, that was a fluke
OH regionals
sigh
he doesn't even have the role tho
In 7 grade French class I accidentally circled or on a test
we dont talk about that
Also what's your nickname supposed to be now
I forgot that you could do that
i havent been endorsed for anything since sophomore year of hs
one of my friends from science fair endorsed me for a few things
I probably should be working on my research paper but doggos said NO
Bruh I just checked your LinkedIn, I don't want to hear anything else about you being smol brain
I have LinkedIn because for CS majors it's really beneficial
shit
Is it EMAC 125? There's apparently a freshman research class for polymers majors on SIS
That be the class
Polymer/materials science major: easily gets into any major class, literally does research as a freshman

CS major: Shows up to office hours waiting on seven other students to query the professor first and struggles to get into core classes
I don’t see the issue with this statement
even tho i just woke up but like
basically what my 2000 word essay due tonight looks like
It's not just CS, any class that counts for the CS major is overcrowded. Abstract algebra, cryptology, scientific computing, etc. are all full but other math classes aren't
Essays suck
working on an essay rn
281 seems p open tho
Oh that seems easy enough
so true im just gonna turn in "dont make students take this class"
I don’t wanna find out tomorrow
we want this class
just less drawning
we need to bonk robinavoch
I am but I stopped showing up to most meetings because they're on Fridays when I'm busy working on Java projects
thats seriously really impressive pri
SHE IS OFFICIALLY NO LONGER A PART OF THE SMOL BRAIN
I forgot lmao
I stopped going as well
There's only like one more tournament this year before the next one in like late January/February
How do you know Blyth? Is he also a BME major? I can't see what his major is
don't have a full ride tho
Only thing I don't like about quiz bowl is that it seems biased towards biology/chemistry/physics/literature and against math/CS in the share of subjects over all the questions, which isn't ideal for me
That sucks
Physics seems good tho
*find the bug in this code*
what is a computer?
CS isnt even hard theres only like 10 numbers and 26 letters u can type how do yall have such a hard time🤣 🤣
wtf is happening
why dont you back to majoring in premed knowing theres only 30% chance you'll go to a med school
30% seems awfully high
Honestly I wish I was smart enough to code
is it not true tho?
Jobs outta college for coders go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Damn
cs people have it hard too
Other majors have it hard but they don't have it hard like CS majors do where they don't even know if they can register for their major classes
It’s hard being a CS major
too many symbols man drop out now
its hard being a stem major period
It’s hard being a student ksbsjdbdjdhd
imagine being able to sign up for your major req classes . couldnt be us cs gang
It's hard being alive
It’s hard being human
its hard being a form of life
Nah there’s not too many of us
Too bad I’ll be back in Charlotte
@_frostyyyyy_ Do you have to study?
We practice for 1-1.5 hours a week but that's optional
@zackt7718 it'll get lost here . post in on #pets🐶😺
There was an MD-PhD student who showed up for practice last week 👀
Bahahah yeah I could never
Drew already wrecked my chances at an MD, let alone BOTH
It depends. For example, I'm normally bad at literature, but I've answered all of the questions about sci-fi novels by Chinese authors that I've seen so far.
BAHAHAHA OMG TRUE, I actually think bader might be worse for me rn
Bahaha mood, I think I’ll end up okay in chem but bio I just don’t know cz of that one simbio ruined my grade
Aw man I’m sorry to hear that :(
SimBios >>> homework tho
He just hasn’t gotten back to me about it at all if he’ll accept it or not
Yeah I will I just don’t wanna bother him and make him more mad
@anjalir519 chris isnt gonna curve our grade is he?
I don’t think so
That happened to me in bio E1
damn those smart people
I did okay on the last one but the other 2 exams really screwed me 🙂
Last time I checked, "STOP" wasn't an amino acid
i got screwed in all the tests sigh
I just know I’d be doing better without mc which sucks
Me in chem. Did fine on first two but next 2 exams were fat L’s
college isnt the place for a smol brain like me
Calculus II really needs a slight curve, Exam 3 was brutally difficult (70 average). The tests should not have been multiple choice
Oh yeah y’all don’t have free responses which sucks
I really wish he didn’t make them multiple choice
i could be doing so many things now but instead im watching the office
If the average is on the fence between C and D for a freshman level class then the tests are probably too hard
Only 11 percent of students got an A on Calculus II exam 3. That's just ludicrous
Exam 3 in that class do be hard
Seems about right
oof sorry i was showering but yes our quizzes and exams are completely free-response
How the hell is this even considered an unpopular opinion
The office makes up about ~30% of the average white person’s personality
i reference the office all the time
it's sad that it's getting removed from netflix come january
we never had it on netflix
i don't have prime
Oh you like the office? Name every single sentence ever spoken on the show
i want british netflix they have all the good shows
forgot about that one, but that's so mainstream so
“i’m the fucking lizard king”
Fair
But it’s still a mood
i've watched it 2-3 times i think idk
nah i didnt like pam towards the end
tf is wrong with you
how could i be so wrong
fax tho
idk how good or shit that roast attempt was
i dont have a fav episode
i dont have a fav episode
I’m genuinely convinced Raunak is a bot designed to spew bad tales
@mag3is dont you think jim shouldve stayed with karen?
she didnt let jim pursue his dream
like she was essentially acting as a single mom without her husband home for long times
he saw that and realized he wanted pam
I feel bad for whoever uses this bathroom after me 👹👹
i think their relationship is complex and messed up at times but i mean isn’t that what a normal relationship is kinda?
wtf??
likeee he was always like gone for pam
I'm sorry but Im not giving up my job that easily
fr tho im single myself i shouldnt be saying that
i haven't gotten an email
Idk
can't relate
i havent gotten any email
idk

Not gonna lie Norton is pretty boring

@raunakwastaken you didnt have to rub it in like that on the whatsapp group

RIP to all those who have to wait another semester to 🅱️ on CWRU
I didn't even get an email
Can't get denied if you never applied 😎
If my shit gets denied I’m burning CWRU after I get my shit
If you were on campus ur only option was staying on campus or leaving?
I didn’t get anything, because I’m staying on campus?
No option for didn’t get an email
Because I didn’t
Isn’t thanksgiving on Friday or something
but this break has been soured beyond belief and it's monday
Close enough
sucks
Don’t test Mother Nature
How often did we say 2020 can’t get worse
rip
I didn’t lol
My optimism is just that “it’ll always get worse”
Pessimism is “it’ll always get worse :((“
I haven't gotten the email
Knowing that things will get worse is comforting
We need to be on our toes now
When I am not leaving
cause nobel didnt get
cause some people who are on campus rn didnt get
what is wrong with you
cuz its punny
If any of parents dare tell me they’re trying to make a meal
I will Leave
Isn’t that Philadelphia
so, meal is gonna happen
Fuck thanksgiving I wanna Sleep and not Cook
don't give mcdonalds any ideas
Unfortunately cannot do that
Hate it here why would we have thanksgiving and there’s only like 2 of us
guys what imma do alone on campus next sem
Be alone
Could be that someone who actually isn’t getting housing has an id similar to urs
if u didnt fill out that survey u might have gotten kicked out
It’s within working hours
They close at 4
cuz they probs will leave early
but i don't remember from where
dont wait for email that they might miss
idk
i didnt get anything lol
Dear Student:
 
I am pleased to inform you that the University Housing Office has approved your request to live in on campus during the Spring 2021 semester.
 
As you are aware, the pandemic has required Case Western Reserve to reduce significantly the number of students permitted in university housing. While this smaller population lowers the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission, all on-campus residents also must adhere to health protocols and University Health Services’ ongoing direction to help protect one another from infection. Please think carefully about your ability to meet these requirements before finalizing your housing plans.
 
If you are sure you want to proceed, please review your housing application to ensure its accuracy. You also can add specific preferences if you would like (for example, a specific building or location). Please notify University Housing of any additional preferences no later than December 11; the information provided will help inform your assignment process.  We expect to share specific assignments no later than Wednesday, December 23.
 
If you decide not to live on campus, please notify the housing office at housing@case.edu as soon as possible. We have many more students interested in university housing than we have spaces, and want to notify those students of newly available spots quickly.
 
Because of the ongoing uncertainty regarding state and regional mandates relating to COVID-19, we are unable to provide precise information regarding dates for move-in and re-entry testing at this time. The university is monitoring developments closely and will share these details as soon as they are determined.
 
We wish you a happy and healthy Thanksgiving and hope the remainder of your semester goes well.
 
Loretta Sexton
Associate Director of Housing
idk about the room selection and stuff
so u dont need to call
I hate this week already
My helpless depressed self is hoping that you can go
we're still deciding
Ugh I’m so sad
I don’t even wanna study for the rest of the day
Fml
life sucks
I’m really spending A WHOLE YEAR at home
They won’t budge
Even some of the more expensive places with concierge and security are still cheaper than university housing
NOW IM INTERNALLY CRYING
Rip
Pri just runaway from home and roomie with someone in their dorm:)
Even if you went with a 3 bedroom it’s like much cheaper
Really Idts?
I still haven’t gotten an email
I feel like it’d be safer to live with other people that you trust
My family def wouldn’t want me splitting costs with a roommate if we aren’t basically married
It’s 3:15 and I’m tired as shit
Parents won’t let me
Do you think they’d hate it more if you rented with or without roommates lol
I left you all for a whole 45 minutes
I have Indian parents man
Lost u for an hour big sad
I lost another semester
Biggest sad
“I can’t believe you bought 2 bags of banana chips mom, you are the only person who eats them why do you need 2??”
Ron I need some more tide pods
Leave the pens on the desk
WTF
I'm at the airport but I'm coming back in February hopefully:)
Seems like the simpler option
seba cutter is right beside taft if im not wrong
Idk about the other side tho
if its not taken
Cause that'll be sick as hell
Don’t remember
I highly doubt that ill be in any of the freshmen dorms tho
Rip
Honestly just don’t even go to campus if ur on south

raunak if you don't go can i have your spot
That’s fair
cuz india's time zone is wack
You’ll be stuck in a new room for 3 months, a change of scenery
We all just hang out in our rooms alone mostly and shitpost on discord

So what we’re doing now
100% guess rate
Go get bibibop and eat sadly in room like the rest of us
@mootdoot is it really that bad on campus?
its so dead
BiBiBop slapped harder than Ray Rice’s Elevator Service
All of us on campus have been saying we can’t do anything lol
and even i went and saw it myself
The very few in person Clubs closed the last monthish before we left because of Covid
This is why you’re all alone in Columbus not on campus

Oh then no
I’m thinking ab asking my PI if there’s a reason I need to be on campus
you already got into research this semester?
i was gonna research in bme but decided not to do computational work
smol brains arent big brain enough 4 research
aw :(
Ooo yeah that sounds big scary I could never
I didn’t get housing
as soon as the profs said i had to learn all these programs i was like aight imma head out rip
wrong text channel sorry

Bahahaha yeah I have to learn some R but it hasn’t been bad bad yet
I didn’t wanna get into all the other scary stuff
But that was all the remote work available
Oh funnily enough
Oh fr?
Yeah for sure I mostly just cold emailed/went to research fairs
oh i couldn't go to the research fair
I wanna nap so bad but I won’t sleep tonight if I will
I don’t know if anyone’s letting undergrads into the labs so idk how many like positive responses you might get cz i got basically one or two
Were you able to go in person?
Because I think if I can mention to my professor they’re letting some undergrads in he’d be able to help
Yeah except this last week
Question: for the people who still want to be on campus but don't get housing, couldn't they just lease an apartment close to campus that's not official housing?
parents wont let me tho
I just want kitchennnnnn
we don’t live by case rules
but finding it b hard
like yeah sometimes it’s annoying cooking food but u can eat exactly what u want
fair nartha
sorry im lazy
Dishes aren’t even hard
just drive your car here and live in the car
Bc idk if I’d have enough reason to stay in cle for the next 3 years to actually rent an apartment
Who hurt him
If you are trying to spell the name ron make sure you don't misspell it by adding a W and a G
PRI
GO GET UR MONEY

zhanda you dont need to type out the whole emote
I was so mad looking at that price
OMG RON
OMG
the reasons its expensive is cuz its near college
Hyde park tho
Ron I can’t with this dude
zhanda aint the sharpest tool in the shed
But isn’t Hyde park in England?
Or am I missing something
There’s many Hyde parks

That beat went hard
Get the fat get tbegays
That shit came out in the 90’s bruh
Get the fat*
It be going hard 😭
Born in the wrong generation Zhanda
Now I have to study cells on a molecular level
Before tech it was “blood is red damn that’s crazy”
Now there’s organelles n shit
Migos peaked so hard with culture
I won’t listen to shit if I don’t want to
And I don’t want to
What are y’all even evaluating this shit on
Isn’t that the other dude
Never heard a carti song tho
Ima be honest Uzi fell off
I don’t have anything past that one album
My bare minimum knowledge really pulling rn
He still make shit?
Gucci washed but his old shit smack
Man I listened to 6 foot 7 foot a week ago
The list that I never end up getting to
Ima be honest i don’t see the j Cole hype
Never liked him
ANACONDA DONT
I’ve never heard a jcole song
Shit
I had his whole thing then I didn’t and now I only have summer madness
Rip
My basic knowledge only goes so far
Zhanda and I aren’t like Raunak we are diverse
Man I listen to everything and nothing
Still just rap tho
My music library is stupid, it bounces all over the place
If we’re talking rap tho I have basic ppl
Only losers pretend to care about lyrics n shit
I mean flow n shit
When I'm.in need
Kanye west be hitting hard
Graduation hit hard
I had Pablo for like 2 weeks then never had any Kanye ever again
He didn’t? Kanye is known for producing his own music
Oh nevermind 🤡
I would still be stuck in this pile of shit 10 feet below
Knowing the bare minimum about rap artists I guess
Fair
I don’t even think there’s that many classical nerds here
Unfortunately no
this 8ball hates me
would you still invest in it tho?
I dont knkw what that mea s
Innovation that excites happens in college
that happens in college
Or at least it shouldn’t :banhammer:
But at least now the government won’t come for me
Tbf I never said citizen of what country
Besides the final exam
i take it that you didn't
Yeah I haven't lol sorry
Yeah it's longer than M13 😦
Even though it's 1 less section
i spent HOURS taking notes
He really be slacking
nope
The 2 times I actually want to start early, he hasn't had the lecture up yet
Nope
you havent done ANY of the modules yet?
how are you guys studying for bio? cuz i took all the notes, but like....
I’m just really anxious ab that one simbio I hope he puts it in cz my grade would be so much higher with it
It’s been helping a lot cz of the test questions but even those I feel like DONT prepare me effectively for his WACK ASS questions
And I sent in my other answers to him but he hasn’t said if he would actually put them in yet? Or anything? He just said he’d look into it from the student view
I’m just terrified to email him again and Annoy him cz last time I went to office hours and talked to him he seemed super super pressed with me
Idk just his tone of voice I guess? Like he seems pretty chill
But I’m still scared he just hates me completely
i didnt appeal any of my exams
Haven't heard anything back
Cz he left me off the among us email after that too even though like I helped organize it and emailed him ab it and stuff
cuz i felt like mine were graded fairly
I didn’t appeal e2 but I had a frq on e1 and he hasn’t gotten to mine
It probably is but I’m so anxious I’m just gonna automatically assume EVERYONE hates me
omg priii
Only person I hate rn is myself for not doing my work rn
i hate myself for sucking at test-taking
True dat I always feel so confident in my answers only to end up missing so many
oh and bio too
I think I nailed down my study method for chem thankfully this last exam cz I did better but I literally don’t know how to study for bio and do well
I’ve tried flashcards, si session sheets and I do all the hw and take notes on the textbooks and annotated lectures and I go back to watch the lectures and still I ended up doing worse on this last exam’s mc
He legit didn’t even ask ab pedigrees and I spent so much time practicing them I just feel like I never know what to expect
Tbh I totally forgot those existed
Yeah that's stupid
what's your study method cuz like.... im tryna not fail👉 👈
saying exam was graded
but it wasnt
What’s worked for me so far, is to make myself NOT PROCRASTINATE (which trust me is so hard) and watch the videos on the day they’re assigned and take solid notes so I don’t have to go back and rewatch to find info - then I usually try and get to the aleks for that topic the same day (tho that doesn’t always happen, I do it before the next class tho), work through the clickers and make sure I understand them
oh what ive been doing that too
MY GROUP NEVER DOES THE ACTIVE LEARNING
IM LIKE UGH
Also @sprinkles2108 I know this is late but it sucks you won't be able to join us for campus next year 😦
Who knows, someone might not be able to come, you never know
Yeah neither does mine most of the time but we’ve started since we all failed e2, I usually just end up doing it on my own mostly and then asking drew questions
Are there really 400 premeds every year?
The practice questions are also pretty helpful to do as a review before the test, imo tho the problems aren’t as closely related to test questions
I’ve gone into office hours before and just asked him to ask me different conceptual questions
yeah im working on that
And then corrects me when I’m inevitably wrong or I miss something important so I just kinda add those things to my notes so I can go back and make sure I remember them
He’s very intimidating literally all the time tho so I would mentally prepare yourself because the whole time I get SUPER anxious he’ll roast me as he has many times before
will do! ik the content i just suck at taking tests
Hot chocolate on a cold night
what do u want
meg im sorry 😭
i just wanted to annoy ben 😭
yall dont need more admins lmao
nothing to elaborate
sorry

And Zhanda, because I don't want to get 100 pings everytime I wake up
i chose this one specifically because dog
when i want to
and that is never
my goal next sem is to leave my room even less than i did this one
oh shit
rip
helps me not leave my room
for 3 months
connect to internet
not on a plane
doesnt do much
besides, my computer is brick when it comes to newer games
oh rip
without caffeine

still need a nap
i get it i have eye bags u dont have to be a dick abt it
dead inside tho
probs cuz we're all dead inside
isnt that bruce lee?
oh jackie chan
he seems like it
shame he's such a diehard china supporter
that probs needs like a mod or something
but cannot find rip
fair enough
I am upset that I was assigned a lab report due tomorrow, and I have therefore spent my first day of break entirely doing homework
I don’t wanna stay at home
@zackt7718 Since you're already in housing, don't you automatically get to stay if you want?
if i dont do these last two summaries for class
i still pass
I’d assume? I left a lotta my shit in my dorm
wrong zach
i have one due tn
Is it pass fail
Don’t fucking do it lol
You don’t need it to pass why do it
cuz
You work hard so you don’t have to do stuff at the end
you can only miss two
im still doing it
Try hard mentality I could never
after what happened today howdy won't let you ever
What happened today?
nvm moving on
@chandachan don’t you think we should be admins?
last i recall tho there isnt a single lijbvoiebjvohiebfviohefv that goes to cwru
Lmao half of the Indians didn’t get housing
That’s why they didn’t get
Now it’s just boring rain
So I had fun cafe rain vibes
im inside most of the time UwU
That’s fair
OH LALA?
i have several things i need to buy
~~need a good jacket and boots cuz it's gonna become colder soon enough~~
Shit
AWWWW
i wanna get pad thai for lunch but theres leftovers from last night ugh
how unfortunate that theres food at home
Can’t make food waste :banhammer:
Prof Fejes would be mad
i wish i could teleport food i dont want to a random homeless person
Can’t have that
like wtf
this world sucks
She doesn’t need to know shh
I forgot about the 40% thing lol
you didn't need 8ball to tell you that
(PS: I was kidding. I don’t waste food)
I’ve written too many essays for me to waste food
lol i didnt need to take a whole class to realize that wasting food is bad
I’m not doing anything outside he class unless it’s extra credit
Wtf
You’ve never used Duolingo?
I haven’t either
Oh crap
I’m sorry 😔
i haven't canceled you
yet
Bruh I'm getting sick, I better not have corona
you better not get sick that would be bad
oh
given that i dont even know what that is
what if someone isnt sure about the concentration
Otherwise I wouldn't declare yet
-8ball is my weather app correct that it'll rain soon
i still haven't declared mine
sike im still gonna
oh yeah I forgot
I could never
I've done the math and if I take the path of maximum overlap then only 9-12 credits would count towards only a math secondary major and not also a CS degree
I haven't done the math yet but psych doesn't have many requirements
On the other hand, those 9-12 credits are considered to be some of the most difficult college classes (Fundamentals of Analysis and Complex Analysis)
Degree requirements for a CS major/math secondary major with a minor in economics sounds very doable in credit hours; I would need to do 80-83 credit hours in 3 years. On the other hand,  approximately **66** of those would be CS/math credits 💀
Definitely doable but sounds like a pain
@sprinkles2108 Is M14 bad?
I asked it as a muddiest point but it didn't really get answered
He also didn't talk about it in the annotated lecture so I don't think it's important but just in case
I can explain it in vc real quick if you want. typing it out would be hard for me lol
I wish she embraced her Indian side some more though
politicans need votes and bribes
DEAD
Damn felt that
damn i felt that
Into the spider verse is leaving Christmas Eve
leaving?
They couldn’t have picked any other day?
That’s even worse
And they wonder why the sport is dying
Baseball is dying bc it’s boring
it was two tired
What? Really?
"The exodus of many thousands of lemmings, scrambling over rocks and even cliffs, was sometimes incorrectly portrayed in nature films as a suicidal mass migration" (1198)
Yeah but someone brought it up that it was staged
I forgot who
I would be too scared to debunk Bader even if I knew I was 100% correct
I’m gonna miss Bader next semester
Also Nobel my bio exam got graded somehow
I'm assuming very well because you aren't complaining about it?
Improved from last time
Sorry that wasn't supposed to be sassy
Yeah I don’t know if it had something to do with my last name
Honestly though I wish I had a Z in my name
Although that isn't really a flex
I haven’t
I didn’t 100’s on two of them
There was one that I was really close to not getting a 100 on
Yeah you wish you were part of this elite coalition
I can't really check but there was one that I used up all of my attempts
Oh me too in the beginning
Also is it just me or is our homework graded too harshly
Ugh
I think they're more lenient on me because they're like "Yeah I can't be bothered, 100%"
Idk that's just a theory
I know that the impact on the final grade is small but I've made sure that I got a 100 on every CS quiz thus far, but some were too close
Yeah for me I lost 4 points total due to concept checks so I’m not worried
@_frostyyyyy_ I haven't, but I have MyProgrammingLab so
Y’all out here grinding in Java meanwhile I’m gonna fail freakin matlab next sem
I heard it’s not bad either plus you can get a lot of help from the professor and TA’s
131 shouldn't be hard
But I heard it’s mostly a freshman class so
Even Zach said don’t take 321
I didn’t even ping you
Stop sending pics of me ugh
Monday and Tuesday spent on a QChem lab
Because of ✨finals✨
It’s so hard to study diligently
Zhanda guess what
Fuck you
omg toxic
rip no spring break
RIP
Couldn’t be me
Whoever is doing construction outside my house: STOP
I’m sorry
oh lala
Worst part is they stopped it right after I woke up
Better than Breaking Bad
Wtf lmao that’s the funniest shit I’ve heard today
consider length tho
dont be fooled @kaori_flute
oh god oh fuck they're fighting
i have to go watch anime with someone
stop when u want lol
*i shall do the last move*
i just left
OMG
OH LALA?
no i reacted after someone reacted
how does chess work?
im not able to move jenin
someone else has joined
Oh f
Oh f
why do i have the feeling that it's zhanda
oh
I'm trying to decide if I should go to this quiz bowl tournament on December 5th. That's the weekend before three of my finals. 💀
Apparently three of my finals are on December 8th/9th 💀 and then the CS final is on December 15th so I'll have plenty of time to prepare for the CS final
Apparently I’m considered a legacy student because my dad got a certificate in non profit management in the 90s
yeah, tell them your dad went to the law school and will sue them if they punish you
unfortunately he wasnt tenured
never taught a class, never did anything other than just have his name in the system
indeed. Meanwhile, I would argue it doesn't even matter THAT much if ppl don't go to SI sessions n shit
well technically drew doesnt teach anyone
Freshman classes are massive everywhere, here's a Berkeley class with 2000 students https://www.dailycal.org/2019/09/10/cs-61a-course-enrollment-reaches-an-all-time-high-at-2000-students/
Imagine going from limits/definition of a derivative to Taylor/power series in just 16 weeks
2/5 of my professors this semester don't have a LinkedIn profile 🙃
Dang imagine having the guts to send your prof a request. Couldn't be me
Bruh he probably doesn't even know me
I wasn't really paying attention last night
I don't have the confidence to do that
My experience is that people will accept basically any connection request on LinkedIn that isn't a bot
i need to create a linkedIn first
Also for anyone that doesn't already know, CWRU paid Microsoft to give all of us access to LinkedIn Learning
oh lala?
it's been months since i listened to him though
tho
Sorry gotta do work
~~yeah i have not joined either cuz i need to study~~
Also the bio exam is running a full 5 percentage points less than last exam
fair
but the last two exams my grade would go down
@sprinkles2108 I'm doing the M14 homework rn, what did you put for "population growth?" I'm having trouble tying that in
I haven't finished the hw yet. I do know that others were struggling to utilize that term too, though
Ok, I'm worried, not about the fact of me doing it, because I'm finding it pretty easy, but how they're going to grade it
cuz i have trust issues
Bruh I just accidentally turned off my computer smh
No it's a paper summarizing the concepts of the whole class
its less than a normal year, but its still in the millions
yea, they arent having just family, they inviting extended fam and making large gathering
need to stay 6ft away
howdy doesn't exist on twitter
Stupid bot
And that changes nothing
OH FUCK OH SHIT
I hate everything abt that
worse than sonic live action
Everything is so bad
This is why 2020 is so bad
So bad it’s good!
Shouldn’t
Last thing you see before Death
It’s realllh bad to look at
It looks like a human wtf
I wish it was a 2d movie tho
no, they need more monies constantly
When will Hollywood realize that some things are just better off dead
kill it with fire
and boring
while this probably isnt a remake of an animated movie
They could’ve gotten a vaguely reddish brown dog and used that as a base
But to turn a puppy red is only satans work
Idk what I expected from it tbh
I feel like the air bud series already covered the “kinda live action dog” genre of movies
Like they were never going to get it right
fair
I can’t believe Clifford is going to singlehandedly ruin the dog movies genre
cant be any worse than cats
it just cant
clifford fucking eats the child
Clifford the- oh fuck oh shit oh no he’s eating the kid someone stop him!
clifford b normal dog
everything else seems normal
but he never stops growing
Clifford the Red death is loose
If anything that plot explains why he licks the screen at the end of a teaser
their brains are too closed in for such groundbreaking work
That’s what they tried to do with those live action fairytale movies
Make them *dark* and *scary*
Alice in wonderland was just weird tho
cuz whose going to theatres any more
I want it to do bad
But like the normal bad
Because cats still made decent money from being so bad and everyone wanting to see how bad it was
I need this movie to just have sad sales and sad reviews
it needs to be a dumster fire
why arent you in it smh
you wont regret it
im sorry
forr dog shows only, blues clues obv
dont let raunak hear that
thankfully he won't see your text
theres only like 3 dog shows lol
what about wishbone tho?
Oh ye scoobs
Dunno why tho lol
oh
I mean I wouldn’t consider it a dog show but damn that was a good show
the host b a dog tho
It’s a game show tho
Man I wanted to b on that show so bad
They don’t make em like they used to
They’re annoying tho
I will say, i remember seeing a clip during pademic, where they broke the rules are were like, guys, we're fucked
and everyone kinda stopped the drama for a hot sec
which i mean fair enough
I believe they’re back tho
But even then there are better trash shows I feel
the reason its serious is cuz i dont think anyones actually won
But then didn’t
Wipeout is great because no one wins, they’re all in pain
There’s like military nursing but that means I’m more likely to work in an actual war zone
zhanda, first you have to gain and lose ur medical license
It’s upsetting to watch just Bc they try so hard to fit in the actual silhouette but they don’t have to
just got to not fail
damn
I doubt the monetary win is enough to want to cripple
Need to start hitting 6 figure territory to want to injure my friends for the win
surprised the bar didnt hit him on his way down
It is fucking Tanked. I hate that show. It's a bunch of Italian guys taking up air time to go EYYYYYYYY YOU BROKA DA FISCH TANK YOU MOOK and then a rich guy gets some fish he ignores
and since if u were doing it for real and you always broke the tank, u'd be out of biz so quick, i assume its all fake
Omg
I’m PRIty sure he won’t because I didn’t violate any rules
You guys are jealous that you can’t make puns out of your names
Sometimes I hate Dank Memer
cuz roman brought it in
Each minute that passes by we get closer to finals and I get even more anxious
Imma cry
cuz when its not school time speeds up
I got yeeted on Tuesday and since then time hasn’t been real
There’s rlly nothing to the holiday
Except food
The history behind it though
Absolutely bull shit
the origins tho are about harvest season and that weird stuff
a federally recognized holiday, Bc individual states were already doing it
I wish I were Indian-British
Much worse than today🤠
tho tbh, we think that is like super long time ago
Couldn’t even wear pants back then smh
Imagine if we had to wear petticoats rn id die
too much math
It’s almost been 9 months since the corona lockdown began. That means that corona babies starting to come out
those poor poor fools
I can’t believe I get to spend a whole year at home!🥰✨🤠🤡
Economy’s too bad
But I think more ppl are scared to have kids now
“Oh honey there’s a pandemic going on let’s fuck”
ron u of all ppl shouldnt underestimate the power of horny
Well that’s just cabin fever or whatever
Yea Bc ppl fuck when it’s cold
You don’t know holi?
Didn’t want to
Bc I didn’t want to
Is my life sad
Went on for too long
I don’t know
you either die a good show or see yourself become terrible
I thought it was basic show the Office
I haven’t even watched it
Which one is sex and the city tho
I just googled it and that sounds like the worst show imaginable raunak u wound me
Damn Priyanka you got the whole squad laughing
Are we even shocked though half his view points are just wrong
im dead
I haven’t even watched sex and the city
Ron you just realized this now?
I’m not that basic I’m sorry
Seems like ur thing tho
Haven’t watched that either
I’ve never read a lick of 50 shades but man I’ve never seen something so collectively shitted on
he never claimed he didnt read it
Like not even twilight got so much hate
I didn’t watch those movies either
Yea I’ve never read or watched either
Look me in my fucking eyes
twilight is still shit upon tho
I don’t even know
Twilight does have shit on it ye
I dont even got that
I will not be seen unless I want to
Can’t eat and have healthy relationships at the same time?
Wish I was smart enough to do that in Drew’s class
I thought it was his parents being indecisive
Knowing Indian parents he probably won’t go lmfaooooooooo
Don’t put that in quotes
too late
we need to see it by tomorrow
I just want to my sure all my
so start working
I ain’t doing anything more
I’m sleepy gn y’all
too late u already agreed
Can’t let Confucius down
you wouldnt want to make him a liar
show was a gem but it fell into the curse of becoming too long
and then bad
college board already does that
college board is the most evil non profit ive come across
well they aint non profit lol
down with college board
Apparently, CollegeBoard is a not-for-profit, which isn't exactly the same as a nonprofit
Unfortunately Corona babies will be relatively rare as many people are in no position to have (more) kids due to the pandemic and its economic impact.
Either way, we don’t stan college board
Poverty rate is actually lower now than it was before COVID-19 even as unemployment is significantly higher. As it turns out, the government giving people a lot of money makes them stop being poor.
https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/10/20/925476023/economics-lessons-from-the-pandemic#res925483931:~:text=Poverty%20...%20fell%3F
And money wasn’t really given lol
It was probs the combination of some rent holds, the fact that people couldn’t go out to spend money and super small meager as hell stimulus check
I wish ACT offered subject tests so there would be more competition with College Board
Yeah but even then it would still be a oligopoly and they could still collude to fix prices
Or you could have a government option, like UK has the A levels, Germany has the Abitur, China has the 高考
At least the UC system is shifting away from the SAT
We kinda have those at the state level though
Well not really, those aren't used for college admissions tho
Fair
But I believe the state still has to pay which is screwed up
I don't know why but I got a much better score on the ACT than the SAT even though they seem similar
When I took it through my school
All my homies hate them
Isnt the ACT more science based tho?
But with ACT I believe you can miss a couple and still get a perfect score
For math atleast
I hate the SAT periodt
Math was easy tho
Tru but you wont get 800 unless you get a perfect
But in sat math 2 you can miss one or two and get a perfect
Really?
Iirc you can miss 4
Tbh same, but science isn't really science, it's reading graphs
You can miss 5 in total
Which is sick
Bruh I don't, I didn't have enough time lol
Today was completely unproductive cause of my stomach ache
Oh rip, get better
Feel better
Omg no not again
So I won’t
Ya really wanted to uno reverse card raunak huh
I hate the fact that I spent the entire day staring at my ceiling
I mean I just finished module 14 homework but honestly it's trash
I haven’t done that yet shoot
I’ve been studying chem but meh
CS really doesn't have homework except those stupid projects
I didn’t read that
I said nothing
Moving on!
That’s all you need to know
Oh
Science was shit for me
ACT was shit for me
I didnt take ACT
I don't know why but my SAT Math 2 score was much, much worse than my ACT Math score
Only math was decent lol
That's what I thought but reading was my highest score so I don't think I can complain
My sat math 2 score is garbage
I don’t even know man
My score distribution: Reading > Math > English > Science
I didn’t bring it up so
We can stop worrying about the SAT now, we should start worrying about GRE, MCAT, LSAT, etc. 💀
IMMA CRY
I CANT EVEN GET THROUGH GEN CHEM WITH DREW
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WELL ON THE MCAT
Fml
Damn wtf
Wtf 36 damn
Aight imma head out
It’s a 7.5 hour test
Dont you have like 3 breaks tho
I honestly don't know how I got that, I was averaging a 34 on practice tests
Reading is the most abstract shit ever
I’m like 95% sure it’s a test you need to take to get into med school or sum like that
Fml
And by fun I mean fucking awful
Nah dw drew is wrecking my chances at med school rn
Though I came in intending to major in bme
I don't reckon it'd be easy tho
He looks like a golden retriever someone sprinkled taki flavoring on
Death to Clifford
Fr they need to improve the aesthetics of it
As I said, Raunak is a bot designed to give shit takes to test the limit of human patience
You’re just ✨wrong✨
I’m in need of warmth
Lemme guess: you hate it?
Out of context this could sound really bad 😭😭😭
You need to develop taste for it
Im sorry😩
Dark chocolate ain’t bad
It’s not bad but
We need to petition howdy for more pet emotes
We must spread the wealth of dog emotes equally among the proletariat
The only SAGES left now either sound exceedingly uninteresting or are taught by professors with bad ratings
If I don't get SAGES I'll take Psych
im not even hoping for sages
i just want 233 smh
Ok so if I log in to SIS at 6:55 am, select my courses, and then hit “enroll” at 7 AM sharp (without refreshing), will it let me enroll?
I don't think Raunak does either
@nobelium19 That means that you need to get approval from your navigator but you shouldn't have any trouble getting that
So not too bad
Yeah but I don't know how that will work since my GPA hasn't come out yet
16 during the spring though so not that bad actually
Okay that isn’t that bad
i think for the fall registration i couldnt enroll until i hit refresh
Oh rip 💀
Wait so does that mean that if we try to register with a page loaded before 7 that it won't work? 💀
i dont think itll work
the page needs to be refreshed at 7am before you can enroll
We need upperclassmen to answer this for us
I tried it for fall
Bruh that's stupid
And then my program won't work smh
damn
if it doesnt work then you might lose the chance to get into 233
Then you won’t get your answer smh
couldnt be me
I wouldn't have an issue with 233 being full if every other class that I was interested in taking wasn't scheduled at the same time as some of my current classes 🙃
I want to take Physics 2 or Computer Organization but they both have time conflicts with some of my prospective classes
case doesnt like us cs peeps
nothing says cs major like not getting cs classes
Connamacher keeps letting people into his classes, both Theoretical CS and Programming Languages are now at 125% of their capacity 💀
Also CS majors can't switch to neuro because they have no overlap, the closest majors to CS are EE/CE/math
you arent a cs major untill youve not been able to get into one of your req cs classes
A lot of CS classes actually count towards a math major/EE major like discrete math, computer organization, etc.
Cant be cs gang if you can’t even take cs courses💀
Still programming the will to live
Me with my chem studying rn
Don’t see the issue 🗿🗿
Raunak claims he knows my Reddit yet didn’t guess it yet
Because he doesn’t
How many spots are left?
i dont want others to know
You snooze you lose
I thought that you don't get a choice, like aren't there 400 people in the one intro biology class?
cant take any chance
You don't get a choice about TAs/professors for labs though, right?
We just select the section/timing we want
How’d you find it??
Thankfully my earliest class next semester will be at 9:30 so I won't have to wake up at 7 anymore
i dont suck
u suck
what a sore loser
you need it
but messed up towards the end
Which means that I need to wake up at 5:30 💀
I haven’t played chess in years
Apparently chess is seeing a huge surge in popularity because of The Queen's Gambit
but nobel i cant play rn
im not feeling well rn
today was an awful day
idk lol
Bruh @_frostyyyyy_ is big brain why don't you play me
I'm actually horrible at chess surprisingly

i don't *always* lose
im stupid
i don't care anymore
oh
Bruh Idk I played chess with my dad a lot when I was young
Needless to say I lost
Lost in 50 moves against the GM
You can play out a lot of games longer than 50 games as long as you don't blunder a piece
He also only had 30 seconds so that didn't help
or have I
im looking through my history an im not finding laweiuwlerij
i had longer games 
but it was mr and several other people who just started chess
their levels have gone higher tho
and i have gone lower hehe
I am sug now though

Like I’ve never seen two cars collide
You’ve never been in a car crash?
Because it happened right in front of us
The first car crash I truly witnessed that I wasn’t in was with howdy lol
The car at fault
Also call center gets hella overburdened rip
The front left of it was mutilated
Car accidents happened a lot in front of our house 👁👄👁
None of them were major
Some of them caused damage to our fences—
3.6 Roentgen not great not terrible
On a more positive note, here's a graph that shows that far fewer people per capita die in cars in this age than in the 1930s. Also keep in mind that we drive far more than Americans in the 1930s did, so modern cars are even safer than this graph makes them appear. https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4260889/USMotorVehicleDeathsper10000.2.png
That was just the first graph I found. Here's one that plots deaths against motor vehicle miles travelled that shows how much safer it is to be in a modern car https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/figures/mm4818a1f1.gif
its sad no one else got it
I don't got it
Oh
~~not my idea though~~

He gave me a little teaser of what I will  soon be dealing with by saying that redlining isn’t real
I don’t joke when I say I dislike my parents
havent ur parents looked in a mirror
So then I get to have lovely conversations with my parents such as “redlining isn’t real it was basic zoning laws”
My parents are immigrants too but they understand the shit POC went through here
My mom gets it better I just think my dad is brain dead

Airpods are nice, but I would lose them so no

Dead chat
Heard they’re boring
Case won’t catch me slipping like that
I wouldn’t trust a college that didn’t already have their pandemic adapted promo photos out
Yeah, looks like they don’t take COVID too seriously :’(
Maybe Harvard I don’t know
Yes if they’re not going to show students in their college branded masks then they def don’t want my money
Dude from Westlake murked someone from Oakland in front of millions
I hope the admissions ppl took our diversity week comments seriously, because how else will they understand what the youth want to see from a college in a pandemic
I wouldn’t train at all if someone seriously told me I had to go up against a Paul
:XMARK6: **Barbara Snyder**, you can't use that.
I need an other option >:)
Wow my vote seems to have broken the tie rip
Fuck no is the only option
And also: to be cold
But apparently the notion of Ron from my government name has destroyed that
Like it’s not phonetically a part of Marshall, so it can’t count
Just bc it’s Mars doesn’t mean it’s a nickname for Marshall
what if it b tho
It doesn’t count as a nickname either
Who’d I miss loose the first time and not the second lol
so ron is a mushroom
no wonder i never recognized him
I don't really have a preference
Is that Bc you do or don’t like shrooms on pizza
dont
~~oops i ate pizza that had mushrooms on it today~~
Have I ever done u wrong with pizza howdy?
its too early for me to figure out what that means
Yea I just realized lol
hmm, u havent
Rhondillicus will never let u down
Subway for pizzas is something I never thought I needed
as sad as it is too say it, I do miss having near unlimited greasy food at my fingertips
i literally forgot what healthy food was
till i ate an omelet
I havent had that in ages
I said I don’t want to b seen
oh lala?
dunno what that wheaty stuff has to do w/ zuccbook
Can’t blame me
is morning tho
And raunak isn’t even here to witness it
Oh
He missed his opportunity
If you want
Huh what did I miss
And my fb post really didn’t do much for anyone, thought it would be more necessary than it actually was
Shoulda left it up
Nope
I don’t know I never looked at your actual profile
There’s nothing there lol
Not missing much
Yea same even I don’t have any pics on the internet
bruh i tried to help
God I need to delete my Facebook post that seriously did my brain in
I only had an insta profile pic cause of college
Oh
guys i find mmany of these issues can become non issues with a simple step, dont own camera
ur phone doesn’t have camera?
Idk I’m pretty fergalicious the FBI deserves to see it
I’m sure howdy don’t own a camera
I know he has a microphone tho
I’m just going to email my prof that I can’t use Facebook anymore
It’s only 2 weeks more
There’s nothing on my main profile anyway
aparently fb wants ur driver license to make an account or something
And I didn’t get it
Oh
I’m not going into politics in a country full of stupid people
Sorry
But what if u want to b influencer uwu
the once person i need to influence, is myself
Lol fair
cuz laziness go brrr
I look worse with makeup imo
keep me far away
fuck you howdy
no fuck, only truth
But casually I don’t wear makeup because I’ve accepted my unattractiveness
But makeup isn’t as bad as ppl think it is
Just gotta do some work
Right as in “don’t get smashed and sleep in makeup and contacts”
dont get smashed
cuz alcohol suc
dont just cough everywhere
I don’t notice the sharp icy feeling on my face this year when I’m outside
Also society doesn’t need to see my face. That causes more harm than good
that is odd that healthcare ppl arent wearing masks to begin with
cuz like it makes sense to me to wear mask when dealing w/ sick ppl
Because you still have to be a Person
i am not a person tho
And already sick people have mask precautions
smh kids n old ppl, dont u know seeing isnt believing
That’s why doctors back in the day were attractive someone told me
I don’t know if that’s true though
I don’t know
I mean I would panic a lot more in hospitals if I didn’t see faces
I feel bad for them
The 2 times I was in the hospital this sem was a trip lol
It’s a whole lotta nothing
I want it to end
ron, how am I supposed to be in the dystopian future where i get to watch some young 16 girl save everyone somhow, if the hospitals arent spooky and faceless smh
I sometimes tear up when I see videos of nurses telling their sad stories
Wtf
People are dying
Lmaoo. A couple of days back I made my friend listen to WAP and yesterday in his math test all he could think was “there’s some hoes in this house”.
Well people have been are and always will be dying
So like, don’t get too paniky
Thanks but we’re talking about sad stuff rn lol
I know but it’s sad
It do b sad
And wearing ur masks and social distancing in all that shit is immense power
cuz it b a weed out
Nah that’s a libtard conspiracy someone on Facebook told me that
Friends b sus rip
I called in sick last minute
i mean, its crazy, when i went to pickup food from chipotle, some ppl had no masks, some ppl werent covering nose at all
Because I didn’t wanna go
Nose dicks are crazy
God the mask under the nose
masks really aint that uncomfy
Just don’t even wear the mask you dumbfuck
Juries still out on whether I’m actually immunocompromised
Mostly my mom though but dad is partially I think
Oh my I’m sorry to hear that
Is it so hard??
I work at the freaking mall
You don’t have to wear a mask if you don’t go outside
Sigh
I might do anitbody test at some point Bc I was back to back in the hospital in March
i dont think ive got it tbh
I may do it too after a few weeks of working
the jury is still out on how long the antibody last
cuz there are many cases of ppl getting it more than once in the summer
Ugh
Yea crazy how there’s like 3 missing months of data Bc no one paid attention until March
pri, have u even been paid yet?
I got my last work study check today :naenae: :naenae: :naenae: :naenae: :naenae: :naenae: :naenae: :naenae:
Fever, fatigue, cough, lost sense of smell, hella aches, nausea and vomiting, minor chest tightness, 

PCR test was negative though 🥴
I get paid on the 30th I believe and my boss still owes me money from august because she forgot to pay me
But idk how they work yet
smh, pri, if u aint getting paid for being on frontlines, u shouldnt b risking life at mall
Yeah still to this day I don’t know what I was sick with if it wasn’t Rona
Flu?
I’ve never had a flu that bad before
But it’s still a possibility?
Oh yea I forgot about that
Aight sorry guys mom said I couldn’t form a gang. Next time perhaps
Sucks to be a minor huh
Ron I can be in the cake frat tho
Deadass Mono is an evil fucking disease
Thankfully never had it and I pray I don’t get it knock on wood

Never broken anything 😎 I’m gods favorite
Ouch zack

I broke my wrist on my 10th bday party
Same or god forgot I existed like everyone else does
Just never broke them

I DIDNT KNOW WHAT CONDOMS WERE AT THE TIME. IT WAS MIDDLE SCHOOL
i lost the game
I am laughing sooo hard

Sex is the only reason why I am not dying

Voices are p hard to identify sometimes
Oh dang
That sucks

Y’all fell for it
Nothing racial
Hate when ppl try to pull Neels
He didn’t say something straight out racist

What happened lol?
u dont want to know
No need to look far

My conspiracy theory on Raunak has yet to be disproven
He’s a robot designed to give bad takes/be an idiot
*REAL SHIT*
He doesn’t
I sound nothing like him
I need to clense chat
That’s a fair rebuttal all men sound like the Charlie Brown adult voice to me
Idk yall both have deep voices
His is more hyper tho
So idk who to believe
Both of u need to duke it out to take up the single “tall boy deep voice” slot in my brain
Can’t have 2

Still can’t make space for both of y’all tho
Need that extra space for candy
im working through some sourpatch kids rn

Damn I was thinking 5’10”
I think Indians are shorter?? Idk

It’s tall but not like stupid tall
My dads 6’2” so nothing makes sense in my head height wise
Oh damn
Oh yea I forgot babi jail
We need roles smh

I never thought my dad was tall so now my brains working overtime with every new person I meet
Fair
Dang gmos working overtime in the States

Only for the taken?
Oh
Wanna b Chicago soooo bad

Sun rises in east sets in west and that’ll still apply for cali and ny
I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that time changes when you move from one place to another

I don’t have to imagine
But still a no
Dylan never leaves my heart
What happened to Dylan btw
U don’t have dogs and cats tho
wow, ron rlly wants raunak's selfies
Oh I wasn’t even thinking abt that lol
Imagine getting an entire disease Bc you don’t have a backup X
That’s it tho
Cause I haven’t taken biology in a long time
Bc there’s no backup X to even it out
We are all equal in chromosomes, unless something happened
I dunno
Another disease that isn’t Down syndrome
But still p hurty I assume
Oof ouch my chromasones
I took my most recent notes on dna->rna->protein so I barely remember what I took notes on last chapter

Everything outside of structural science is nursing theory n shit
Bruh go sleep

Guys David Prowse passed away
Why are so many famous people dying this year
Do some math
Still our daytime
Still though
Eye sea
Don’t even—
Can’t help it
Okay fine the lizard people in the government realize the people are becoming fed up so they are killing off all the celebrities to make the working class people of America depressed
One of the classes I'm interested in taking has a textbook written by the professor that was last updated in 1998
Lemme guess. Econ?
@sprinkles2108 Do we have a SI session today? I don't have the email
Doubt it. It’s still break
I’ve had this pen for 2 weeks MAX and it already ran out of ink
that seems impossible
I have diagnosed u with too much work disease
i feel that tho, math notes take a hard toll on my pens
and im sitting here like i've taken a total of 10 pages of notes all semester...
I take 0 notes in math though
Who tf takes notes in math
Bio though
Wish I could do the same thing in chem and bio but nah :((((
bruhh i swear I need to write stuff in math to keep it down, like for multiple integration i needed to write every word he wrote so it got into my brain lol
+ our math prof makes a lot of mistakes in his notes so just looking over them makes no sense on occasion
Which professor? I'm taking calculus III next semester and I'm trying to choose a professor
is beaumont near houston
Just make sure you know the material well, his tests aren't really plug-and-chug. Actual knowledge is key
I just checked and one of Horst's Calculus III courses conflicts with Discrete Math and the other may conflicts with a stats class that I'm probably going to take, so it looks like I have no choice about it and that I'll be in Fidalgo's 11:40-12:30 MWF course
IntelliJ has reminded me that I have not used the shortcut for project building instead of the button 74 times now. Instead of memorizing Ctrl+F9, I've memorized that I should click on the hammer
You don't even have to click on that, you can just click on run and automatically builds it if you made any changes
unless you don't want to run it
prepare for the worst
Do you want to review my 13 page paper about fishing bycatch mortality
I don’t think so ron
You’re kinda coming at a bad time we’re all prepping for finals 😅
Oh lol sorry
Why have a thanksgiving break when you can just make all of the assignments due the monday morning after break-My professors, in cahoots
And if you don’t get in to PPSP, don’t sweat it, most of the applicants turn out just fine :)
(And I wasn’t writing it)
I didn't apply because I'm stupid
My mom's friend, who is currently a case professor, wanted to review my essay
Oh snap then go for it
but I have some personal shit on there that I didnt want him to see
Any chance to edit it out and still send it? Or is it a major part of the paper?
It’s an opportunity the majority of applicants don’t receive
I don't think he's a professor even
Don't know hhim
both wanted to review my essays
Or both just as bad
I should write my nursing paper due tomorrow :sadcat:
Our final draft is due this week
mine is due dec 9
Mine is due 10:35 tomorrow morning
rip
Probs depends on how much prof wants to works these last weeks
Because after this week im done with all my classes except for 2 finals
i'm making my final three weeks of a semester
I have like half my normal classes this week and all finals are open note
I wish chem and bio were open-note smh
i have a feeling that won't work a lot with chem though
The computer science exam was open-note and open-book but it was so frantic and fast-paced that we had no time to look at anything
sad times
I did around 100-120 but I realized that I should focus on certain areas. For example, I'm doing exam 1 practice tests and also doing mixing problems/polar area problems. I'm not doing most practice questions from areas like series if I'm already comfortable with them.
oh shit i forgot he had a review
didn’t think of waking up a bit before
I've been watching many of the classes that I want to take slowly fill up over the last week
just dont sleep
Dang it only a week til finals
reallllllly ugh
I wish my finals were more spread out but oof
i am far too used to break already
go sleep
why didnt i think of that
omg @everyone
Don’t come close
People who graduate in January 2020 just registered today and I just watched the open seats in the classes that I want to take dwindle one last time 💀
The one 300-level class that I'm taking (ECON 330) is probably the easiest and least time-consuming, and it's probably because literally every economics elective is a 300-level class for no reason
Wow can’t believe I’ve been Awakened for this
This is the last thing she said
I almost didn’t remember until I checked
But I kinda assumed we had class everyday this week
Oh the zoom links?
Shit
Didn’t know you could even have a legal nickname
Eye sea
Bc I never hesitate for supper
dammit now im late
I lost it when he joined
Same I lost it raunak
oh shit I need my hoodie
Prof ended class early Bc mic wasn’t working rip
Rip
My neck ✨hurts✨
"I'm jealous of you California students"
I was really looking forward to cold weather :(
so i'll get to experience the cold
its about 50, so not rlly that cold
thats too cold
cold is 20s
for a tropical guy like me, that be cold
dont remind me
I want to come back
classes start 1 feb so i cant come *in* feb
Ohio seems like a nice vacation rn
Ye sorry
It be cold
And Die
i guess so
also, dont get the worthless stuff
and the roads get enough salt that even the den is jealous
nop, just rain qq
That doesn’t always mean snow
Could b freezing rain
it aint there
hmm, maybe we need a midwestern's guide to the cold for all the melting ppl
Answer is just don’t go outside
gotta b jenger bread tho
There’s this Amish community I’ve become very fond of in Indiana that makes cinnamon bread
I dunno how they do it
Don’t have the arms for that
he'll never expect a thing
he wont see it coming until it is too late
that could work, but then how do you cover it up
Not me secretly hoping that some people sleep through the registration tomorrow so that I can get my CS class
Nothing much
Just an overview of the class
Sorry to burst your bubble but barely anyone’s gonna sleep in we’re all neurotic to get the classes we want
Oh ty
Bye !
I’ve been studying chem for so many days and I don’t know if I retained ANYTHING Imma go cry
I sat there bamboozled for 10 minutes not understanding how there was enough information
I’ve been redoing my notes but I don’t know if I remember much
I’m in physical pain because of Drew✨
Drew’s class is gonna screw me over
its not snowing tho
Sorry
Sorry !
I am sorry !
Bye !
rip, not up here
still rain
i never got an answer
and i'm still undecided
I don’t yell at them lmao
@lunativity I don't know who you are but I just caught a glimpse of your status and it says that your sister is struggling so I hope she gets well soon
lolll nah i actually felt kind of bad because their  status says that their sister is struggling so I just wanted to hopefully give the person some comfort
@raunakwastaken bruh go to sleep
It’s 6 pm and I’m so sleepy
It’s almost 5am and I’m not sleepy
Nah the Chinese government won’t let them vote
16-17 hours or so
Oh really?
I didn’t know
You'll never be the most populous time zone tho because you're on a half hour
It honestly sucks when I try to figure out what time it is in India
The half hour do throw me off
I can't do that math in my head
30 minutes isn’t even significant enough
You suck
@kaori_flute what happened to our timed chess match?
mmmm
do be sleepy rn
but ok
I be sleepy
Bruh you still have to register for classes
@kaori_flute be awake when I get up
You can’t force her
OMG
oh lala?
it should be illegal to be this tired
rain is illegal
I slept for 12 hours yesterday why in the absolute fuck am I tired
Last night I got 5 hours of sleep and have been working on chem since like 9 am so F
I took a 20 minute “nap” and feel a little better
But man I wish I had more strength so I can study hard AND retain info
I’m so scared I’m gonna lose the battle against Drew in chem
Oh whale
Imma cry
I already lost the battle against Drew
come join me in the land of dead grades
i just saw that there isn't gonna be a target/walmart shuttle :)))
probs due to rona
Drew's RMP page has been getting destroyed lately
but-
he has office hours
Connamacher's latest reviews are all about how he's a great professor but how this isn't an intro class
nothing
not an intro class, its a weedout for smol brains
i never understood a single word he said during his meetings (if he was home for them) growing up
that's also why i didn't pursue cs
lost track
after reading for the nth time why ur wrong, u generally are completely dead
Bruh where I don't see it
Omg fellow CS parent reject
fr tho i rejected the field before the field could even wreck me
ugh
I have a math quiz tomorrow that my ass ain’t studying for
For MATH 122
Thank god he drops the worst quiz because I don’t wanna study rn
I have to remember around 5-6 formulas/equations/theorems for tomorrow's quiz which is like half as many as I had to memorize for all of Exam 3
so i'm gonna kiss my 12/20 and 16/20 scores goodbye
As long as I don’t literally get a 20 on the final I have an A 🤣
im vibing in math
I'm jealous of the 121 students, 122 covers much more difficult topics than 121 and a lot of us are struggling to get an A
only cuz 125/126 sequence is much easier than 121/122
Me on Chris Butler Exam’s versus the quizzes
i could've taken 223 but was too chicken to
My ass stay getting B’s on the quizzes but exam time? 100, 92, 100
wish that were me in chem
but nope
ugh
i wanted to take 121 to soldify my basics
cuz different hs systems :"))
that's why i retook calc 2 cuz it was immensely, IMMENSELY hard at my hs
I took 121 because my Oompa Loompa of a calc teacher straight up didn’t know the information
and then just stopped responding to emails
GRIDDY HOURS TAP IN @chandachan
you can't feel it but i started an earthquake on the entire west coast from all my head banging
idk about there
Sorry I just had gas
My bad
@sprinkles2108 biol 214 and 214L, chem 106 and 113, the FSTS 100 seminar, and then idk what else
are you guys able to enroll?
doesnt happen until another 7h lol
Dang they’re trying to impeach DeWine?
Poor dude
UGH
You don’t have to participate in the fite
RIP
context: kaorus is me
also
bruhmoment
also sorry it's offtopic but what the moo
oh lala?
Some friends of mine threw some small rocks at the window they thought was mine and the two chinese students who lived next to me were very confused that a bunch of white people they didn't know were bonking their window
RIP
I feel old
Although I don’t think I’ll get it
~~looks like raunak does not want south campus anymore~~
Is Hitchcock bad
A fate worse than death
Ah shit
ohhh ri9p
dunno
sorry
i have not studied yet :))
no don't sleep
JENIN YOU GOT THIS OMG
OH MY GOD STANDS FOR OMG
or u will miss enrollment
2 hours is enough
aww ty :blobheart:
no
u'll miss it
it's 2 hours
i know if i go to sleep now i'll never wake up
i think 10 alarms won't work for me
it's like that at this point
I’m up at this time because I have to go clear the walks at my grandparents so they can get to their car safely anyways
So I guess I’ll just sleep again at 7:10
Can someone drive to Ohio and wake @nobelium19 up
Hes awake
Only 8 spots left😬
Hope they have a horrible day
12 mins😬
I'm just sitting in my bed because I'm so tired and cold
it's 4 in the damn morning I better get theses classes
Isnt it waffles something pancakes ?
5 mins
4 mins
Bruh I can't I'm going back to sleep after this
shit my wifi is acting up
SHIT SHIT SHIT
y'all need to stop being so smurt
okay it seems to be stable now
2 mins
ohjhhhh shit
i tried to enroll rn and it was angry at me
aidan trying to cheat the system ic
but like if they had quietly turned it on i wouldn't have left you guys in the dark
yea it wont let us register now
damn
nothing t th?
Um Idk if it worked
Wtf is happening
bruh it's just slow
there's literally thousands of people trying to access the site rn
yeah one 3 hour class
still loading for me
Yesterday: tired as shit with 12 hours of sleep 

Me now: WIDE the fuck awake on about 6.5 hours of sleep
I didn't get in to 233
rip
somehow i cant get into bio
wtf
if it says u got it, u got it
when does registration close?
233 got closed in like 5 mins
damn
most of mine closed instantly
stat 333 was closed in like 3 minutes
I didn't get into Sell's Calculus III 💀
Fuck the 223 Jterm
Well 233 is closed now
what am I supposed to do now
i think the entire gang got into the class
except samuel
oh
Yo I signed up for PSCL101 because I was afraid I wouldn't get into USSY but I ended up getting into USSY, anyone want it
I got Science of Happiness, Linear Algebra, Data Structures, Fidalgo's Calculus III, and Public Finance. I can't register yet for Discrete Math because I need permission and I can't register for Logic Design & Computer Organization because that would put me at 20 credits
can we talk about how i woke up at 7:01 am and rushed downstairs so quick and sis was being so slow
Yeah I haven't registered for 225 yet because of credit limit but there's literally 999 spots
So I'm in a bit of a limbo, but I'll get into discrete math. My advisor (the professor for the class) is not going to deny me permission
I asked my navigator about overloading and he didn't mention a form.
Not sure, but if you want to take more than 19 credits you need to fill out an override form
Did you get all the classes you wanted?
same despite waking up a whole minute late lol
other than ochem lab b/c that class got full & he just told me to do a permissions req form to get in
So if you can't register for something I'd suggest to not register for one of your easiest classes
Yo did anyone take eng 145 last semester; if so, are all the lectures recorded because it conflicts with frch 320 and I really want to take both classes
oh i see that's unfortunate :( at least he's letting you in. the class itself isn't hard it's just tedious at times (and can be time-consuming but eh)
Unfortunately it's full now
Oh you don’t have Wnek?
RIP
SIS is so fucking slow
oml why didnt i enroll
bruh i am not taking that class again
apparently 233 got filled up at 7:03
Oh shit
They aren't held during recitation?
Rip
he actually turned on his camera? wow
18 credit hours here we go
lmao im only doing 16 without a J term
if there isnt, email the prof
Why is it so bad lmao
oh there isn't so I guess I have to email the prof
prob cuz of the prof
Rmp rating is bad ?
idk tho
i had an ominous feeling
cuz it had 14 open seats of 17
maybe students want to avoid it cuz it's hard
is what i assumed
but submit a request too ig but idk
Yo CSDS281 doesn't fit in my schedule unfortunately
Need to find something to fill it, I'm thinking PHYS122?
rip
if i want music
i have to drop a class 💀
I didn't pay attention earlier smh
SORRY
REPLIED TO THE WRONG PERSON
that was supposed to go to raunak
Might just have to take it again because I didn't understand physics at all in hs
I dont think you could compare the two sems
oh lala?
all the classes I want are full
She doesnt change
i just chose a random one since the timings arent up yet
O yeah I was looking at 122 my bad
Ive heard that lab is super hard
Bruh can't find it
Oh shit im in that one
Theres 5 seats left
ah shit
0 seats
I can't sign up for the other one though
the lectures are gonna be the same tho
Ugh I'm kinda dreading this class already
nope
4 seats left
I can't take Physics 2 because I have Linear Algebra at the same time
Bruh I just realized I'm taking BIOL215, CHEM106, and PHYS121
i might end up taking another sem with him
cuz i might fail this class OwO
RIP nobel
I might have to drop physics, that aint it chief
There's still spots left
I didn't understand a single word of physics in high school
also study group for data struc
My brain is not big enough to do that yet
Phys 121 cannot be that bad
im p sure we can still attend the in person lectures tho
Haha I wish
Bruh I don't know how I did this at my dorm but if I get anything less than 10 hours of sleep my brain just turns off
i need to go back and understand calculus and titration for my quizzes today sigh
I forgot everything already
i still dont understand how titration works
Ugh
finals ;aleif;alwiervcw2
bio final is most painful tho
I somehow have some margin left for bio
But I could be wrong
same but idk why bader's tests always make me more stressed than ever
Oh what
Same here in math
idk why but im sleepy
Go sleep
same, our math professor just stares at us awkwardly
Oh our exams are 50 minutes lol
drew may be basically khan academy but he has office hours every day almost
omg
EXACTLY THIS MAN IS SO UNAVILABLE ITS THE LAST WEEK OF CLASSES AND HE ISNT HAVING OFFICE HOURS SIR?
Bio makes me cry on the daily
I just got permission to register for CSDS 302/MATH 304
Yeah. In addition to him not caring if a class gets too large, it would have been awkward for him to deny his advisee permission for the class
Bruh why do I need to open Lockdown to access the exam
Which class?
Wait shit isn’t that supposed to b tricks
And I’m in class so I can’t see💀
Um it doesn't work on phone?
You don’t understand Ron this module was 7 weeks ago
I’ve been surprising good with keeping up with my work
So next sem will b shit
How tf does titration work
Come to office hours
He has office hours rn
But I think I can leave since we can take the quiz anytime
Honestly I don’t even know
And I’m in a class that has a recitation
Math
But isn’t recitation just like, repeating things over n over
Oh
College rlly do b wack
Anyone need j term soc101 before I drop it
U can’t just steal that smh
I turned my camera off just before you joined lmaooooooooooo
But now I’m just doing work
Even though he mutilates me on exams
I’m doing math rn
Oh shit it’s December
And only 18 of those are filled with school
Nope he was confident
Then he slowly went
People are confident with my first name but then they see my last like “I won’t even give you the chance to laugh Bc I just won’t say it”
Oh same here with my last name
But idk what happened today
I hate Tuesday’s
Bc I saw is hair longer than that pic
Camera is back on
I left
Damn
That’s why I turned it back on
Imma find you :)
I’m not that hard to find methinks
That’s so much work tho
I still don’t know how titration works
You showed up to office hours
About the tImE of the exam
Plus I don’t remember titrations lol I’ve been studying other chem topics
Mam I have a math quiz rn
Rip
Also, I don’t know how math works
Oh
Imagine taking math 🤢
I didn’t have to
I don’t suck at math
All I need is med math which is basically conversions
as my little brother says, It's not illegal if you don't get caught
By rules of the Bible or whatever longer hair = more power
I stayed til the end of office hours hehe
Ok I just opened my exam and I have to say, I'm fr dumb sometimes
But there's 2 MC that I'm fr confused, like I thought I answered correctly?
You have to use Lockdown tho
Fr annoying
oh what we dont have to in chem
I want to see what you put
I missed on multiple choice
You just tell me which one you missed
I missed the one asking about what happens when there’s a mutation in the promoter of a eukaryotic gene
Isn’t that an frq?
I don’t think that’s allowed
We're not allowed to upload questions that we've already answered?
I don’t know my friend had an issue with a question and screenshotted it and sent it to BADER and Bader was like you can’t do that
Like you can’t screenshot pictures
And this was after the exam
Well it's in Lockdown so how else am I supposed to do it?
I’d rather be on the safer side @nobelium19 don’t want anyone getting in trouble
I wish, I don't have a middle name actually
Yeah makes sense, just seems like a weird rule to me imo
I swear BIOL215 better be more clear cut and drier than this
It's drew again and Idk but it seems like it's difficult to get a B in CHEM105
You're right the reviews are horrible for the covid fall semester
They're actually better than BIOL214 tho, and I've gotta say Bader isn't that bad
Bruh how do all of my professors have horrible ratings
She has it setup that you only need to complete x number of quizzes/discussions/etc. out of the whole semester, but if you don't stay on top of things, then at the end, you'll have some problems
That math quiz
Find the volume after the the shit gets rotated fam
I’ll pay the inventor of calculus 50 dollars if I ever use that shit after college
The last one I just said fuck it here some work
Last one was the easiest
okay i need to change my math timing . how do i do that?
plus i heard that we dont have any hw
The professor for PHIL 222 is apparently a professor of philosophy, psychology, neurology/neuroscience
It's like an interdisciplinary class from what I've heard
rmp has some bad reviews so i didnt enrol
Really?
Oh I did see that class
yo this is a stupid question because i've hardly ever seen snow
Ron how cold is it in chicago
and this was several hours ago
i'm sure it's much deeper now
We don’t have any snow in our forecast
ok nevermind maybe not waist sorry i'm gonna act an fool when i step outside
i wish i were in texas
someone is gonna go cracc
they been serving them damn brussel sprouts
i only ate once from them these 2 days
pasta-
I-
can't download the app for some reason T_T
what phone u got?
1Phone 6
iphone
OMG
DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN
Guys there are not enough hours in a day
And why do chem problems take FOREVER to do
i feel like campus would be on some post apocalyptic shit because there's nobody there and a fuckton of snow
I really don’t wanna do sages rn but UGH I present tomorrow
OMG
I was shaky as fuck but he said he would grade them
isnt that his job?
so why would he ever say no, if he doesnt he gets complaints from above
I mean like I didn’t press submit so I didn’t know if he would
ah, does he have a strict no late work policy?
Not really he just wasn’t being responsive about whether he’d grade it or not
I’ve been embarrassing myself incessantly trying to get baders attention
We lost quite a lot of people during the breakout rooms lol
Bro no wonder my room was so fucking cold
He pronounces my name correctly though so am I still part of the club?💀
My mom left a damn window open n it’s 39 out
If you can’t pronounce noble I don’t even
Highly recommend napping at midnight if you need an energy boost
Quick someone how many days is this
And this was a lighter year because I wasn’t in the headspace to listen to music over summer wowzie
best buy is the worst tbh
there was a graphics card released today
that was supposed to be out at 9am EST
i sat there for an hour and a half refreshing oml
903 hours??!!
Last year I was at 1100 hours
ik someone at 1666 hours
Nah bro some of us can’t live without music lol
mines low tbh but thats cause i dont just listen thru apple
I’ll show the final actual end of the year numbers but I’ll probably be close to 1k by the 31st
listened to eminem for 350 hours .
ik my apple replay isnt too accurate thou
theres some artists missing
i wasnt kidding when i said im addicted to eminem
From last year??
I didn’t do this last year so I don’t have much to go off of
mine was 100 something last year now its 800
That sounds like Work
One would hope so, those things b expensive don’t they?
bruh ive seen people make their own computers but they dont game
if ur not gonna game then ig u get like the worst graphics card lmao
well, you dont even need a dedicated graphics card then
yup was like such a pain tbh
and im so tired
hopefully u didnt go to a scalper
uhhh havent completely settled on anything yet
doesnt it hurt your eyes?
do u need wifi or u got ethernet?
Wel how’d that happen
That’s like another 10?? hours
I swear I haven’t opened Spotify
also mag, then u will need wifi adapter
You gotta go thru the whole story
To the end
Okay calculator says 13 hours
i dont have the story
You don’t have this at the top?
@mag3is https://pcpartpicker.com/product/tTdqqs/gigabyte-wireless-network-card-gcwb867di add this bad boi
i dont
that might be cause i havent listened on spotify since april
and ron, over the break, i'd recommend getting a usb to ethernet adapter for ur laptop since ur gonna need it for ethernet connection
My dad already got one
shit i ate it
Oh shit I forgot about bringing a food item today lmaoooo
idk what happens after tho
I HAVE A FRUIT SNACC
FUCK ME
i already finished fuck me
oh fuck why am I eating this
I don't know how old it is
bruh I'm hungry
but not for stale watermelon hard candy
bruh i cant stop laughing
on camera
you won't
i just am laughing i sucked on a fruit snack for 5 mins
you are the worst
SORRY
it tasted horrible
I can't even move this jolly rancher to one side of my mouth cuz it gives me chipmunk cheeks
sorry i'm a smiley person
neel if you dont stop laughing i will bonk you
I turned my camera off too
Sorry I laugh easily
Literally if we were in in person class I would be dying
sorry i was just bantering
they'd want u to think that
I think i ddin't screw up too bad
Damn
Nope not me
nah i dont
nope
i dont think so no
Really?
Big rip for the both of us
Chocolate bad idea leaving melted chocolate in ur mouth for more than necessary is the opposite of meditation
I was slurping it like soup until I realized even without my camera on I looked stupid
i brought an apple and i really shouldn't have
cause now i'm committed to eating it even though i'm not that hungry
drew's final exam calculator saying I can bump up a letter grade if I get a 70
final exam calculator
I want to cry
after last exam I might have to try to get that score 👀
CUZ HE LECTURED
I don't rly understand how it works tho
Final can replace one of your topical exam scores
oh like with or without replacement
The with part is what your grade would be if your final replaced your lowest topical exam score
then my min fe score thing is a fat lie
I need a decently high grade to get an A in the class🤡
I don’t have an A in chem rn so I’m smol brain
how do you tell drew you want or don't want a replacement?
I need a pretty high grade on the final to get an A. I don’t know if it will happen
You don’t. He decides. Whichever grade is higher is the one you get
so if my final exam is my worst score, he'll just add it on instead of replacing my lowest topical exam with it?
I guess?
Hehehehehehehehehe this final exam score is spiking my anxiety
@_frostyyyyy_ you’ve done really well on his topical exams. Any advice on studying for the multiple choice?
Because somehow I miss the small details
I need a 91.4 kms
But I don’t trust this calculator
we're both gonna die
Like I need it
I want the brain
I go to a lot of SI sessions, do all of the active learning questions and I get ALEKS done early. I also review all of the quizzes/clickers and skim slides before exams.
If you don't trust the calculator then set up a linear equation for the grading = 90 or 80 or whatever grade you want and plug in the values that you know and solve for the unknown final exam variable to see the minimum score that you need to get
I’m just going to shoot for the highest grade possible. I’ve heard people do well on his final and I’ve been studying slowly but surely over the last week and a half or so
I’ve been religiously doing Drew’s practice problems but really need to get on to the active learnings
Richard Nixon lost the 1960 election partly because he campaigned in all 50 states. If I know that my grade is essentially fixed in one class regardless of how I do on the final exam, I'm going to triage it.
Agreed. Hence why I haven’t touched math at all yet
Unfortunately, I'm not doing as well in my other classes, I need 80-81 on two finals for As and around a 90 on one final
don't even know what that is
I don't know why, but chemistry was much easier than calculus imo and I'm a math/CS/physics person instead of chemistry/biology person
Drew told me that he'll recommend anybody with a B or better to be a peer tutor, but that SIs need As
Oh yeah I heard you ask that at office hours yesterday
You need to get an A in the class
Also girl go you I wish I were that smart
I have a 94 percent average in CSDS 132 right now but I'm extremely anxious about Project 5 and the final exam, I'm relying on all of my earlier grades to carry me over the finish line
Is there a possibility that this class is harder than last semester
what if u are foreigner u need something special to work???
It's 10 hours a week, here's the page for it: https://case.edu/studentsuccess/academic-resources/supplemental-instruction-si
It has to be, I don't think 40 percent of people are going to get As this time. It seems like most people aren't completing projects now.
40% of people got A;s last semester? or what do u mean
Not sure how it would work, but there should be one
CSDS 132 is weird, some things are really easy (pre-labs and labs) and other parts are quite difficult (projects). There just needs to be more TAs because they're overloaded constantly now by everyone trying to fix their projects
For the people who can't access it because they're not in CSDS 132, it was an earlier survey that wasn't the same as the course evaluation
Oh I did that but I didn't send a screenshot, am I fine?
That was through Canvas so Connamacher should be able to see if you did it
Now all that’s left are 3 finals
I still have three assignments left, and one of them is time-consuming 🙃
I still have to write an essay
the problem is that I don't even have a prompt, so I have to come up with something to write about
cant bs bs
I know my essay will be related to campaign finance reform, but I need to make a specific argument about it
it's only 3-4 pages though
my professor says he wants "quality over quantity"
i think my prof wants quality and quantity, cuz he was grading these tough
I don’t feel like I’m typing right if I don’t have it in standard MLA
I don’t feel like doing anything anymore
Ugh
All my finals are next week too
was next week supposed to be dedicated for study or something
cuz its not
Week after is finals week
My finals are next week
I said my finals were next week too
I don’t even know
I am enjoying probably my first and last college career finals that are open book
I wish Chem and bio were open note
And am very scared of karma
can't cheat on the MCAT
Can’t cheat on nclex either I’m sure, but I don’t think I’ve learned anything to even attempt to cheat on it anyway
All I kno are how cells work
Although cheating won't help me that much in bio anyways because most of the points I miss in Bader's class are because of poorly worded questions or questions that require upper level thinking that my smol brain can't handle
Hate short response questions
**Hate short response questions**
See I can’t even spell
Short response just isn’t it
wrong one
fax tho, its probably mostly the former for u tho since ur megabrain
sarah needs y's help
I just need to like get the poll to show up in the roles channel
if I cause trouble
I won't
I always wanted to see a fight between two people both with the dj role
Cameron i won't do such a thing
oh
u already got it
why didnt you just edit this 1?
I didnt.. know u could edit...
well I'd be a pretty bad influence
Did I do that math right?
I just realized I have a math quiz tomorrow
Did not do the math right
People still use Reddit
somebody posted something the other day that was essentially "guys help i need to decide if i want to transfer to cwru in <5 hours"
someone was asking about the attractiveness of guys on-campus
and apparently it was a serious factor in their consideration
LOL PROFESSOR STUDENT STUFF WTF
oh jesus there's a race component
i don't see the post
sorry
as a person from close to LA myself, i wouldn't be surprised tbh
so, prepare to want death
even more than u already do
not as bad as my friend at osu who got his reddit found by his porf
i mean i guess
oh
so like when he mentions a specific class and how he hates the professor, it's obviously him
rip that guy
bruh im getting 2nd hand
don't end up in here
im doing some sherlock holmes type shit
what school?
although there ARE a disproportionate amount of pricks in that school
is that a commentary on people's personality or the sex makeup of the school
aren't like half of uc students gonna be homeless
California as a whole has mass housing problems
so they go to msu instead
California housing is fucking messed up
oh yeahhhh
damn
which is the LAST part of California you want to be in
they dont have my major at ou though babs
so i couldn't
OU doesn't have meche ?
Seriously?
A literal unloveable shack in San Francisco sold for over a million
yeah for example UCSC doesn't even have an engineering department and the school has like 30k students
i don't wanna go to texas
i wanna leave the country
oh japan /
fuck moving to japan
but i'll never move there
fuck china
i don't like speaking mandarin either
don't care
i've got all of the shit I'll ever need on hard drive anyway in terms of entertainment
and people in New Zealand are apparently really friendly
is the wifi bad in nz?
it's pretty bad in oceania in general
Australia has real garbo internet
I ain't the only Guo in this area
Why is it so goddamn hard to make a cwru passphrase
Don't get an attitude with aidan 😤
@bravo5127 If they don't give you a pay raise I'll go contact the SI coordinator
isnt ta stuff volunteer work?
Dw I won’t judge lol
I just need help in getting through the class lol
Wish that were the case in chem for me
does registration end?
something wants to say the 16th, but its probably until a week or two before j term starts
snow already melting b sad
Have some snow left for when I come
You can still register for classes during the 1st 2 weeks of the semester
You can still add/drop
Agreed man I hate it
And don’t melt and make everything look ugly
You’re not wrong
but isnt that have a late fee
doesnt*
Bruh everyone do be pronouncing my name wrong
Sorry I didn't see that
I dont feel bad for those who got scammed like some of the emails were so badly written that you have to be THE MOST GULLIBLE PERSON ON THIS PLANET to even comply with their requests
I really didn't see that 😢 I'm so blind lol
you dont mean to say
someone fell for
if u fell for that
how are u this bad
Tbh I didn't notice that, I just saw "work" and I skipped the email
that ppl fell for
Rip @Deleted User
life is pain
All he said was “oh shoot wrong person LOL”
You’re good it could’ve been worse
Given what I was dming yeah it could have been much worse
I feel validated
if they want to
hopefully SI aint a rat
Joseph do be keeping me on my toes tho lol
I’m gonna miss them
just dont pass class
but one of them is leaving b/c SI spots or something
cuz smol brain dont got the power
Swear to god if this class has taught me anything it’s that I need to buy an iPad for next semester
I don't think they can
someone on Twitter got busted for saying something in DMs
so dont get clicked  on
Bruh mine's not graded yet
Sadly not for long for me since, chem lol
I’m most worried about chem
or just use a computer
i have a laptop rn but i can't draw on it
but like it do be tough still
dont
our math prof said that his surface kept overheating
if you are desperate to draw on a computer
i could just draw on my pc
get a laptop w/ a touchscreen
or get a drawing tablet
had one but it was for osu & broke
cuz then i have it anwhere i b
cuz paying <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Idea: What if I continue to use paper to write my notes but then scan them into OneNote using Office Lens? I like writing on paper but I don't like having to actually store/organize the paper
i have a bad track record of doodling instead of note taking and loosing notebooks within 5sec
was honestly considering this, but at the end of the day you'll still have a stack of paper
at the end of the year
cleanse urself from the work
I’m probably going to have to keep my notes rip
rip, how come
Oh Shitsorry
thats sick as fuck bro
Oh are there people transferring here for spring? didn’t know that was a thing but that’s cool af
Aren’t there only 2 currently lol
theres probably more that haven't joined
and more that haven't transferred yet
We out trying to make a living they taking Damn gap years
Might as well.take a Damn gap decade and fly to the moon wtf
damn
I want to die
Bye
Forgot the step where I had to convert from g/L to mol/L when calculating the Ksp
but it doesnt say the class
AP Chem me feels your pain
where do find that?
I requested one and sent two emails to her... she hasn't answer back
dont they have until like jan to make decisions
"you just want to get into the system rn"
What's that supposed to mean lmao
lmao idk
Yo I did not eat well at college, I actually lost about 15 pounds from 1st semester :/
Yo I did not eat well at college, I actually lost about *my ability to feel emotions* from 5th semester :/
I neither gained nor lost weight, which would be good were I a healthy weight
*fat*
I mean honestly for someone like me having to take agency to get myself food already decreases my food intake. Were I on campus I probably would have lost a decent amount of weight from just forgetting to eat.
i'm at home and i just kinda dont do anything so
cause i'm super cheap so i'll probably never buy snacks when i live on my own
as american, i can never lose
So now my chem exam is exactly 12 hours after the math one
I’m opting to take my math exam early in the day so I can get it done and over with and focus on chem for the rest of the day
I’m not crying you are
Holy shit
omg
Houston in the finals what ? 👀
Drew's computer generated quiz was broken and told us that our answers were wrong every time and then when we asked him about it, he said that we just got our math wrong
The acceptable answer was always really close to the answers that most of us were getting
@stuckinohiolads idk
Cause we won’t be able to leave in between
Is it the last day of classes that's why?
last day of sages yeah
I'm done with humanities/social sciences requirements after J-Term as well, but taking 5 math/CS/physics/engineering courses a semester sounds like hell, so I'm probably going to take one social science class each semester that I don't have SAGES
Has anyone gone for the meeting?
Meanwhile I’m still figuring out chem
I still don’t know wtf titration is
Though this last topic sucks
I only need one topic til I’m done
Ugh
This second one sucks
it took me a half hour to do that one @sprinkles2108
pain in the ass
And math
Drew just admitted that he was wrong on this one
He just needs to try
he needs to teach more than once a semester
Dude taught me so much chem in one office hours lol
That one ALEKS titration question about equilibria was the worst topic in all of ALEKS for me
Isn’t it a conjugate acid?
Oh
I got it wrong
Ugh
Apparently
I did this like 30 mins back and I never came across this type
No acid I don’t think left
Apparently row 2 is wrong though
WHY WTF
Wouldn’t HCN be left over?
Haven’t checked lol
no HCN left
BAHAHAHA DAMN
Shit
Team work
makes the dream work
I probably should be doing work but I have a dog laying between my legs
@anjalir519 am I on the wrong track
I shouldn’t be reacting the two right?
Oh
So you’d have OH-
Oh I leave out the Na then
Will still be present
i am stuck on this one too😔
I can help if need be!!!
Oh man memories
this took me a hot minute to figure out
Yo someone help me too. Imma fail
Somehow I got a 20/20 on my final Calculus II quiz even though I got one part obviously wrong
Lol you didn’t get it
we can review concepts on vc now if you want!
chem vc study sesh lol
nothing gets the blood flowing like excel spreadsheets
Got my first spam email✨ except this guy tried to hide themselves well. I was already sus since I wasnt taking sociology this semester but yeah
They don’t even try and hide it
damn there's really just a group of people copy and pasting these things everywhere wtf
it's really tempting to click on the links :)
Car wrap manager
There's only 56 people in the Java lecture now for a class of 250 people
Oh right, finals
anyway how short should i cut my hair tomorrow
isnt ur hair around your shoulders?
i also havent colored it in a while so
so now im running away
she just really likes my hair and keeps asking me and i keep saying no lol
finals week hits different
OMG
we will answer any and all questions you have about a school I still have not set foot on
@ctw1591 whatever Barbara Snyder says DONT believe it
i am so lost
But Cameron no I didn’t leave cause of that lol. Why would I.
Once finals get over we’ll have epic among us hours
I honestly don’t know though
I did meiosis but I don’t know what to connect it to
Because we didn’t really connect the two other than replication occurs in meiosis
Uh wtf how lol
I wrote a whole page of shit
OH just increasing genetic variability
S since
Just for me to miss opportunities to mention small connecting details
But it’s already so long
SUNSCREEN WTF
Oh well I’ll just remove it since I don’t know
I’m genuinely scared for this assignment
I wrote a lot but didn’t go into much detail like some of y’all did because like it’s a summary
I just need my one brain cell to learn enough mitosis to divide quickly
Yeah I think he doesn’t want any lengthy ones
Like mentioning specific details? I didn’t do that so yikes
I haven’t either he asked for a summary
So he technically won’t know if it’s over a page
You didn’t insert a document?
Probably doesn’t matter
Idk someone pinged me and said I can ask them stuff about case
you seem to have added urself to the prospective students role
Oh
I’m kinda disappointed no prospies joined
Like cmon we don’t bite 😂
I was in hella servers at this point last year
Oh I didn’t even see uR ping lmao @sprinkles2108
I still don’t know what campus looks like
People who can’t drive for shit
Everything on Euclid is open 24/7
no i said i won't send vids
casecash is a savior ngl
wish i signed up for more
and there is no casecash foe winter break
Just to fuck around, I am now a 2025 prospie 😍
Pls someone answer my burning questions about case
Is case a packing school?
What’s packing
Money laundering
911 yeah we need to arrest someone
I offer humor off of trauma from classes so if anyone needs it let me know
don't use 911 on campus
shouldn’t it be 216?
oh lala
During office hours
he then went “raunak” slowly
And wasn’t confident
it's ok raunak
people pronounce my name wrong all the time
Rip to us minorities
People fuck up my name too
And they still mess it up
POOR RAUNAK
I did not wish to offend anyone
@ctw1591 unfortunately I can’t do business with you due to your recent behaviour
Ah fuck I guess I’ll have to leave this server 😞
Prospie gonna leave
Y’all I’m not gonna apply for case anymore 😤
OH LALA?
It’s very short
Don’t watch it
Shit I gotta switch dorms then
i want die
Oh
Oh
I mean nevermind ig since deadline passed
It won’t matter that much
Guys I will cry because of chem
If I fail this final
I will cry
Laugh now cry later
DONT CRY NO
Sir the score I need on the final....... lmao
I wish I could “this” emote more than once
@anjalir519 IS GONNA GET A 100 ON THE FINAL I CAN FEEL IT
I’m currently dying in bio tho
Really exposing myself here
What are the maximum points on the exams though?
What I I don’t like canvas
At least it isnt schoolloop
I’d say so far 18/20 because you’re missing words
The only class that I'm feeling bad about is Calculus II, I have a feeling that that multiple-choice final is going to be difficult
Oh gross wth
She also had painting of a dead or horse
I’m dumb though
Everything leading to population growth cause people be horny
Alexa can grade p hard at times
Oh
She’s given me 18/20’s which was annoying
I only got a 20/20 on one homework
Back when I tried for this class and turned in my assignments
Then I realized
That im in college
Because I had a serious panic attack that I was gonna get a bad grade in bio
Because of that one stupid simbio
My parents getting emails after every grade ^^^
Also you can’t get higher than an A cz at my school we had H which was for honors classes
Fr and mIsSinG assignments
Oh
Bahaha I have been blessed with a brown mom that don’t give a shit ab my grades it’s wonderful
K-12 shit
oh, even then my parents didnt see grades
bad
I’m blessed with a chill dad who just wants me to do my best BUT my mom is strict on grades like the usual brown parent :(
chem bad
I don't talk to family about GPA much anymore since I'm going to get a maximum of 3.78 this semester which is worse than what I had in high school 🤡
RIPP I told my mom I might get a bad grade in bio and she shrugged and said and I quote “you’re dumb I’m not surprised just get over it and go for a run or something”
it will not be hard trust
Not my mom telling me to just fail all my classes cz maybe at least my hair would stop falling out
@anjalir519 I asked my mom if I looked better or worse in glasses and she went “well glasses make you look smarter” she didn’t even answer the question properly💀
BAHAHAHA OH NO FR
She never asks about my grades anymore
I agree I look awful in glasses and tbh awful in general but ayeeee we vibin🤪
Omg no you don’t bahaha
There's just very high expectations in my extended family so I really need to maintain a 3.5+. Most of my extended family expects me to go to a good graduate school, and I don't want to disappoint anybody
I only started wearing glasses like two years ago and now I can't read well without them 💀🤡🙃
Sadly yes
Contacts make me cry
I can’t even wear contacts
If I had to put contacts in under 5 minutes or watch my family die in front of me 

RIP my family cuz I ain’t built different
I don’t wear glasses or contacts 
But will do soon with the work we are gonna be given ✌🏼
I hate the way I look without my glasses
I just don't wear glasses :dab:
Damn I forgot I haven’t slept in 27 hours
I hate the way I look with my glasses
Can’t even spell ur name right
Rip to my zoom image
Go sleep raunak
It’s morning there though
But
Sleep hours
I also need to eat something or I’ll die
I’m blind without my glasses though I’ll fall
oh it is like 1 am in CLE, isn't it
You can go a week without eating
Damn you don’t care about clifford’s vision???
Why didn’t I think of that
Poor raunak
RIP what a man
Ye he’s rly short
One and a half month left till I’m officially in EST
I miss June
You forgot Dayton and Toledo
lmao i've never even been in the eastern US before
Do we really need to remember Toledo though?
Nope
damn
kkk is still there?
Why didn’t Obama ban it?
Oh shit mandalorian is out
Hasnt it been out?
oh
How does Raunak know it and some y’all don’t
Nah I just don’t watch much tv in general
Don’t hide
I never watch Indian tv
What’s so bad about Indian tv
It can’t be worse than current day Nickelodeon
Wtf
Don’t deny it
I can’t even argue with you
Leave it
Raunak you can’t let her bitch you around like this man smh
@nobelium19 sorry but this is the final username
Omg Cameron noooo it’s cringe
I’m not even gonna click that
I didn’t even click on the link
watch it
u won't regret it
I haven’t clicked on the link still
I don’t wanna click it
So I won’t
Pri it’s not cringey

It’s fucking hilarious
I’ve never watched anime
No I can’t
I just can’t
Pls keep your weeb shit outta here
@zackt7718 the editors do be hella bored
They had to have ripped a fat rail of white lightning before
I told you to keep that weeb shit out of here
If you haven’t watched Avatar we can’t be homies
Is anime actually bad lol
I don’t remember it so F
seriously
stop
smh
At my hs people looked at you weird if you watched anime and I felt bad for those who did
AOT highkey weird as fuck lmaoo
Imagine tryna explain it to someone
bruhh
don't put the horrible stuff
Ain’t no gore 👹👹
We scared them
They couldn’t handle the power of anime
yeah
never start with attack on titan
i started with detective conan kek
but i already watched multiple as a kid so dunno
detective conan has more episodes than one piece  though
Guys why am I still up and why am I not grinding out chem problems
Don’t pat yourself too hard there Pri I can feel your spine trembling under the sheer force
if u want
we can watch some dr.stone :))
jk
Jokes on you sitting in one place for 3 hours at a time already destroyed my upper body
Should I sleep or study
Staying up cramming and losing sleep won’t help you honey
About phone batteries
Is it bad for the device if you plug it in to charge when it’s already at 100% battery
Idk
I didn’t know what they were until I started looking for a biomaterial to write about
guess i'm not a civilized human being
oh lol i forgot hydrogels were a thing
He still going on
Damn
oh i paused for likr 45 seconds inbetween typing
Now it’s two people here who can’t spell their name 🐶🐶
damn what a roast
Zach isn’t
Zachary phonically makes sense. Zach doesn’t
zack and zach need #couples-therapy
Do I need to use double spaced and 12 sized font too
who doesn't mute this server?
If it makes you feel better I have every single discord chat I'm in muted
Every single channel in each of these servers is muted so that I don't get BUHDUP in the middle of what I'm doing at 900% volume
The existential threat of your ears being destroyed gets the blood flowing
It was legit pissing me off one day, I can't quite remember why
Ok I should sleep so I can study tomorrow lol
It wouldn't stop showing notifs during a test so I actually just uninstalled all of discord in the moment out of frustration
Sorry I'm not rich, I have to slum it over here with my acer
I’m not rich either
It was sick
I’ve EASILY used them for 1000 hours
Though mine are 3 years old now
Fuck them environments
And each one doesn’t even last an hour on zoom calls
Damn yours suck
Mine are about the same age and last longer than Ron Jeremy
Aren’t you a dem socialist?
Though
I use a pair of Sennheiser overear headphones because they have incredible sound, active noise cancelling, 20 hrs battery life, and they aren't small and I cannot lose them because I am stupid
They last 2-3 hours
But on zoom calls they lose charge fast I don’t even know how
It's always the damn ghosts
I signed up for her Homework Helper volunteer program or something like that
The drink water and don't be racist
I’m from suburban Ohio where there are a decent amount of Indians in each neighborhood yet people are still racist at times
But most are silently tolerant I don’t know
I wish it was like that snuggle commercial
Idk why but all the Indians in NC live right next to each other 

Atleast that’s what my friend shirish said
cant say ur wrong
This is one of many gems of racism from a classmate of mine who is now an  unsuccessful used car salesman
its so bad
Bruh wtf 💀💀
Oh no what even is that
As if the government doesn’t already know everything about you via the PATRIOT ACT and they don’t already track you through your GPS monitored phone
I’m still deciding whether the majority of my piece codes should be in the makemove method or inside the respective piece classes
Did you get your Project 3 grade yet? If you got a good grade for your hierarchy, don't change anything
For project 3 the TA told me to do the limitations(like pawn can’t go back, pawn promotion, and king castle) in the makemove method
Did I do it wrong?
But project 5 has a lot of this stuff so idk if I should write everything in the makemove method
Isn’t that a method stub tho
Damn wtf is a default method
what math 223 class u guys have
If I don't get permission for the 9 am class I would have to change all my subjects
Why tho
I did apply to the jan session and sent two emails, she just didn't let me in, without even replying any email
Ye she wont allow
Nah she wont allow
She said that she's keeping the class strictly to 35 :(((
prob mostly people who didnt pass? or second years
Nope 💀
I'm wondering who these upperclassmen taking calculus are
it'd be sad if only people not interested trying to pass
damn
calc 227 doesn't require nearly 10 hours a day, despite being a more advanced version of the class
does 223 require 10 hours day?
which seems like a crazy exaggeration
even then 10 hours a day seems like a bit much
considering I probably spent only about 5 hours a week on the class this semester
including class?
although to be fair I had a tendancy to do homework during class
not after this pig class
i didn't learn any english useful for writing academical paper or thesis
I became a sage on pork tho
... pig class?
its basically a pig class
pork bad, veggies good = granted 4.0
rober dont buy your meat for tyson foods
it really depends on the topic of the class
Also soooo many freaking writing assignments
Not really
what all did she say yesterday in the final class?
Nothing much lol
So some discussed silicon since we didn’t talk about it earlier
It wasn't the materials class, it was called "Silicon and its Applications" or something
The content was interesting, but we didn’t have many discussions. He just mostly lectured
i hate sages from the bottom of my heart
But it wasn’t very engaging from a seminar standpoint
Damn gold is used in medicine?
i wish our sages was cool
But hey at least we didnt write about cement
we had a lot of assignments tho
Apparently it’s hard to get an NA seminar so I got lucky with an FSNA
I got really anxious when I had to give my presentation during the last SAGES meeting
Yeah I don’t like it when classmates ask super hard questions
I feel bad about asking some of my classmates questions that they couldn't answer but "Preparedness" is a large part of my grade so...
wtf which one
Bruh 2025 class are getting admitted and I still don’t know where the campus is located 💀💀
Because if they didn't, their grade would fall off of a cliff. Attendance was mandatory and taken very seriously in my SAGES
I accidentally missed one SAGES presentation meeting towards the end and panicked for a moment until the professor said that it didn't matter because it was one time
yet several people when to those
about 6 people watching, I attended all of them, I got the feeling they liked us there, we cheerished them
Yea gold is shit in Minecraft apart from making golden apples
I don't know a single person in my SAGES who's getting an A and attendance is also mandatory.
that's awful
And measure angles wtf
Crazy shit
my prof was the previous provost of CWRU and his class was not intense at all
I couldn’t find anything about Baeslack
then i realized quick that he's so chill
I thought it was gonna be crap
i will miss this sages
it wasn't terribly difficult
This class is beyond yikes, it's wrecking my GPA. If it wasn't for SAGES then I would have a good shot at a 4 this semester
one B won't break your career tho! you still have the rest of your undergrad career to go
And some car stuff
True. I'm never taking another SAGES with a difficulty above 3 though
I have learned what a 4.4 difficulty rating looks like and you don't want to know what it's like
not me preaching that a B isn't bad as i sweat over my chem grade
what are the odds that the math department will let me become an SI for math 126
i had no idea math 125/126 had SI's
and we never had those this semester cuz 126 is typically a spring course and i took it in the fall
It's not just premeds that panic over Bs, I want to go to as good of a grad school as my parents did (they both went to a top 5 school) so a 3.78 in first semester isn't ideal
Wow. But one B truly won't hurt your cumulative GPA. If you have straight A's from here on out you'll likely end with a 3.9 by the time you apply, which is not bad at all
I want to defy regression to the mean
Fuck mornings
oh
Regression to the mean means that children of outlier parents are between the average and their parents almost all of the time
What’s wrong with that
I believe in you, but please don't pressure yourself too much. It's not healthy
Stress makes things worse
do it for yourself really, my fam is over the top that i was able to get to a us college, yet i'm aiming for a 3,7 gpa
pressure yourself but don't let too much other people pressure you
there's nothing wrong with aiming 4.0 or getting to grad but do it cause that's what u want, if u don't want it you'd do better on what u want always
The true end goal is whatever dream career you have, doesn’t matter how you get to it
and a paper due friday but not an exam
ew night exams
I have a big CS project due tomorrow, several paper revisions due on Monday, two finals on Tuesday, a final on Wednesday and then nothing for a week until the last final
simply, dont
And the one final that I get a week to study for isn't even the most difficult one for me, so my finals schedules are about the worst possible
which i had last week
and two of my classes didnt have finals
but the ones i have left are my harder classes so
Only Connamacher isn’t
y'all are lucky you have open note exams
LMAO yeah open note? never heard of her
and i also have a writing portfolio due for sages
Open book doesn’t help that much
fair
except this last essay
i just had to do that again but it was just a reflection on a class
but he said he wanted more detail so
i mean if you want more detail this time AND you give me the freedom of what to write about (still related to the class) im bound to go over the limit
but it wasn't much
i went over the limit by 1.5 pages double-spaced
I hate writing papers
so it truly wasn't much extra stuff
i don't mind them as long as the topic is somewhat intriguing
but i wish i was a better writer
Me too, ap just conditioned me to write really really fast and terribly so college writing has been difficult for me
Not to procrastinate and actually work
yoooo on my math final im allowed to bring 2 pages of notes front and back
wish i had this incentive in chem smh
damn
i struggled to not procrastinate on them rip
oh that's interesting to hear. I haven't really liked his teaching in calc 3 and I've just been really bored with the class overall.
idk maybe my expectations were too high after i had a really good HS math teacher for calc
i also had really good math teachers in hs
their classes were much more challenging tho
and was too scared to take 223
@sprinkles2108 when is the sages profile due?
Two is a lot Damn
I don't know anybody in my class who got an A on participation
professors that do bs where u have to do other stuff to get participation suck
but djjava has been open for so long
Interestingly, old CRT monitors had burn in and modern LCD monitors don't. Ironically, as we get more advanced display technology with the OLED display, we are facing the issue of burn in once again
Vote I’ve done ALEKS problems all day for chem and just reviewed some bio so should I sleep now and wake up early to continue studying or no
Do I power through for another hour despite being sleepy
Imma cry
Somehow I've gotten good grades on chemistry exams and I still feel like I have no idea how anything works when I look at the review sheets sent out by the SIs
i wish
I’ve been grinding out the ALEKS review problems today
Which class?
Math 126
In MATH 122 (Calculus II) the final is 50 multiple choice questions in three hours 💀🤡
or a decent portion of the exam
Yikes. I don’t know how many questions ours will be but my prof said he’s gonna make a 1.5-2 hour exam but we get the full 3 hours to take it
Plus we never had multiple choice
I find questions involving area/volume to be tricky, so I don't like polar area/fluid pressure questions. I find series to be very intuitive
For me math in general just naturally clicks with my brain
David I can send you like a cheat sheet for all the types of problems you will encounter in fluid pressure if you want it
No cheating though👀
I don't want to study much for this chemistry final, but I also don't want to get like a 65 and ruin my inertia
I wish I only needed a 68 to get an A in chem
Sigh
or is it just my internet
been stuck on this for at least 5 mins
class of 2025 already registering 🤡 🤡 🧚‍♂️ 🪄
oh
Yo someone should play me in xiangqi on my program I'm bored
Bruh I am worrying about it I'm procrastinating tho
I've been so busy this past week with the project I just need some down time
How? There haven't been any finals yet so how do you only have one?
I have the Java project due tonight, SAGES writing folder due tomorrow, two finals on Tuesday, one final on Wednesday, and then one last final one week after that
My writing portfolio is due Friday so guess what I’ll be doing right after the bio exam🤡
It's not just the finals schedules that's bad for me this semester, I also had six classes every Wednesday
do you know if the writing reflection thing is supposed to be like, 4-6 pages? or just a page
the assignment kinda went private so i wasn't able to check
iirc the reflection is supposed to be 2-3 pages long
it got taken down?
> Yo someone should play me in xiangqi on my program I'm bored
Imagine having a working program, couldnt b me
I won't play, but I'll write edge cases for you
Im already getting an F
pygame that shit
no, i want die
it doesnt do anything
oh
im gonna fail the chem exam
wrong
i need a 70 to end with a B but i want an A
i need to get a 91.4 minimum
if you want A's ur already big brained
the dumbest person can want A's
in this case in chem im trying to earn it
but idk if what im doing will pay off
imma cry
I applied for internships and got nothing and then got too busy with classes to keep applying
I've applied to about 20 probably, haven't heard anything yet for most of them
except for getting rejected from my dream job but we don't talk about that
So apparently my SAGES professor gave us the pre-made citations that she thought would be helpful and then I copied them, but then I got warned because the citations weren't in proper MLA format because the titles weren't italicized
Does anybody know how to cite an old book MLA style? I want to cite a book from the 17th century but I don't even know who the publisher was
I want to cite Thomas Hobbes' book Leviathan but I don't know how to cite it since it was published in the 1600s. I found a Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy that sums it up so I may just cite that instead
Unless you're working out of a copy from the 1600s there's a more modern publisher
There are some concepts from the book that I want to reference, but no I didn't read most of the book
IT SAYS JOLLY AND 8TWENTY6 ARE OPEN
Oh your phone isn’t updated
Yea I haven’t updated
Damn I need that emoji
Is it supposed to mean tears of joy or crying on the inside
Crying on the inside lol
Because it’s crying but smiling
@raunakwastaken so we're making a family now: you and I are married and we're adopting Nobel because we can't procreate ourselves
yo you didn’t get housing sorry
and this entire weekend I was like fuck
Idk
No longer a bebe
My torso hurts
I’m mentally dead
Hate grammar tho
We did it in middle school too
It actually wasn’t that bad I quite enjoyed French class
I don’t know why
Lmao apparently
No I didn’t 😉
Guys I’m about to cry for chem
I’m scared
Noo don’t cry
Crying helps sometimes
I feel better after crying lol
But rn I’m just dead
I was gonna guess Harry Potter
Screw jk Rowling though
No I already knew it I wanted you to know I knew the exact scene
Where’s that crying emoji priyanka
I don’t know I’m not on my phone right now
Happy crying !!!
I still have a freaking “?”
do you feel offended now
this is worse than sending a pic of google search
i die
you didn't see that
didnt i
FUCK YEAH
A delayed death for me
then studying for pharm
Rip
I spent my entire morning redoing all the take home quiz that I thought I finished 2 weeks ago
imagine being able to see the sun rn
Damn it sure is dark outside lol
oh
we never had those
oh
thats still an A tho in anatomy>??
that sucks
I guess that’s the disadvantage to rona, nicer on the work but higher grade ranges
i guess so
I can't see light because chem is a black hole of studying
studying all
Rip
Nursing final is open book but I’m sure that’ll do jack shit for me when the time comes
wtf
Benard said she doesn’t normally do them but we’re struggling ig
we didnt have extra credit for that class
On a lighter note, I saw this when I went to the CS TA office hours yesterday
Too bad that the TAs grade it instead of the professor
Idk
Who told me that it was a good idea to opt to take my math final at 8 am
Mam I’m taking my CS test from 2am to 5am
Shit wth
math is making me a little nervous idk
Omg I’m so nervous for calc 😭😭😭
30 mins to go bois
i need a 75% on the final to keep my grade in the class
and i calculated my projected final exam score
and currently im sitting at an 82% based on how i'd grade my exam
so im praying i didn't frick up
I finished my behavioral economics final earlier. I need a 24/30 to get an A and I'm feeling a bit uncertain about 2 points worth of questions 💀
I didn’t think it was terrible, but there were like 2 questions I couldn’t do, and 2 which I think I’ll get partial credit for. What sucks is that each question was worth so many points like I’m just nervous that I may be on the edge now :(
I don’t know
anyone else gonna just rush the math exam to study for chem
This is making me really nervous about being overconfident for chem, maybe I should start studying it now
I think I may have been overconfident for math, but I’m praying that I didn’t mess up terribly
I used RogerHub to determine what I needed on the final to keep an A in math and it said 75
I don’t know how accurate that is
Omg @raunakwastaken we’re in the same zoom 💀
Run while you still can
I’m so nervous for math now
I was vibing in that class
Now I don’t know how that final went
Being 100% deadass I haven’t studied a lick for my 121 final
I “studied” for my math final last night when I was making the notes we were allowed to bring
Ayyy you can watch me fail
I couldn’t even finish my notes because chem drained all my energy
If my math is right I need a 21 on the final to keep my A
I wouldn't study at all if I were you, I think you made the right choice
ig that's fair, i'm better at chem than bio (cuz im more of a math person) but my grade in that class is lower
I don't know what RogerHub is but determining the minimum final exam grade that you need for your desired grade is easy. Just solve the equation (percent of grade already done * grade so far) + (total percent of grade that is from final * final grade needed) = whatever grade you want
so i couldn't focus sm on chem
fax though
wanna do the math for me rn lol
tho i hope he doesn't throw a curveball at us
yeah, I'm just hoping his vocab usage is on point so we don't exactly have room to have different interpretations for questions
there aren't like, e4 appeals are there?
on that thought i still need to send in my e3 appeal, crap
like you said earlier, idk how he's gonna get to all those appeals
did you take the morning exam for dr tran's class?
i didn't and I regret it because of other finals
Omg same I thought it was cute but the postcard made me wanna angry cry
I haven’t even seen that yet
Bruh math test was too tiring
Study for your exams
that math exam wasn't that bad
uhh honestly it wasn't much of a mistake but more a stupid thing, he was trying to apply green's theorem to a boundary that was clockwise rather than counterclockwise
oh
the signs for my exam weren't visible
math professor moment
idk why it was doing that
Don't get covid cause they still can't keep it under control 😠
they don't wanna go home and infect their families
Well I don't think they *can*
> they ~~don't~~ wanna go home and not infect their families
cuz 100% there are ppl who are insistant on going home even if they got the rona
@nobelium19 Did Duolingo send you a year in review email? I got one and apparently I studied Chinese for 1700 minutes this year and was top in the top 4% of learners
It’s okay I fell asleep in the breakout rooms
i tried to nap today but my anxiety wouldn't let me so now im sitting here with a headache the night before chem
Im so lost with this chem stuff
like how am i supposed to study everything
when nothing has been taught
drew def will throw some screwballs cuz every chem test thus far he's done it
I’ve accepted my fate so I’m worried less
Yea I haven’t heard anything
isn't duolingo pretty bad with most non-european languages
Main problem with Duolingo Chinese is that it doesn't test handwriting, but I use another application (HelloChinese) for that. Another thing that I don't like is that it doesn't really teach grammar and expects you to infer the grammar as you build your vocabulary
I don't know if they made it easier to find on mobile
I’m gonna cry
But I’d be losing quality studying time though
Seriously take 10-15 minutes for yourself rn
As much as it seems like a waste of time, take breaks
Fair
@_frostyyyyy_ my brain is fried after this math finals lmfao
My brain's not fried but I don't have any time left to study for chemistry regardless
Damn y’all got classes still?
God damn I got off easy as shit this semester 😭
For all those taking the chem final, remember that this is the last test for this class for the semester so it is perfectly okay to swear at and flip off the camera when lockdown is active
Better believe at the end of 106 I’m doing this tho
but I'm still going to flip off the camera
Duolingo is terrible full stop. Nothing beats a good textbook and some native exposure
its differnt styles of learning, I learn literally nothing from textbooks (based on usual classes cuz I have no interest in foreign language)
it also says to insert the last disk of the multi-volume set
Only since Thanksgiving iirc
I’ve never seen it move until today, I honestly thought it was a nut with a Christmas hat
FUCK OFF
rip
Chem is in 4 hours I’m gonna cry
I don’t even know what to do anymore
Oh great, there's five different sections of the chemistry final which means I have to go through the process of starting a Lockdown test five times
If it helps I’m down with fever and can’t concentrate anymore
My chem test is gonna be shit
RIP
Oh no I’m sorry :(((
I'm done with chemistry forever in 7 hours 😎
but its still up in the air if i pass the class
I havent gotten above a 35% on these tests, and the grading says its min 50 to pass
I think that Drew is going to make the final easier than most of the previous exams, the grades on exam 2 of CHEM 111 were horrible and he made exam 3 easier/graded exam 3 more leniently as a result. It's not going to look good for him if the average grade in general chemistry is C
i dont think he cares all too much about looking good
he doesnt want to teach gen ed chem
so if grades r bad he wouldnt b teaching it
I’ve heard from people that the final exam is usually easier than the topical ones but who knows
I’m feeling so dizzy
I had a headache last night so I feel your pain
Can one take the final later if they’re down with fever and stuff?
I’m sure even with a fricken hospitalization and he won’t budge
Idk what to do
I can’t fucking keep my eyes open
cuz drew only looks at emails from them if at all
If it’s that bad then definitely email
i overheard my mom on a zoom call, "Oh I dont drink that much"
while having 18+ bottles of wine just behind the computer screen
rip
congratz  on the test tho
-8ball will I crush this chem exam
-8ball will I crush this chem exam
Wtf
-8ball will I fail chem
it was confirmed when i asked it if i was getting hot cocoa
it said yes
but dunkin was closed
If anyone wants to review/quiz each on chem concepts in vc lemme know
I don’t even know anymore
it all went ✨ poof ✨
i wish i used my a levels credits
if i applied
Chem would be fine if Drew Meyer didnt pull trick questions on the exam
Did you go to school in the UK? It's not common for people in the USA to have A-level credit
He can't fail all of us, if everyone gets a bad grade then he has to curve
Damn dont bring up the f word
the thing is
we have a lot of big brains who will not fail
Too many big brains in our class
I wish I was one of them
Does anybody here study until moments before the exam begins, or do they take a short break beforehand?
calc yesterday i got in the right mental but now im gonna study until the test starts
study
myabe even during the test
I study
But I dont
I am but I don’t know how likely it is
which is real pain
i wish i was smort
so it's still morning
Y’all are at office hours lmao
I don’t know ab that one
Didn't even know Case did interviews lol
other 13% of the time they aren’t scamming
the chem exam is over?
chem sucks
oh it was garbo
btw, can someone confirm whether i got the last part of the last question right?
jk y’all do whatever ur heart desires but we don’t condone it here.... i am looking away
I didn't put ut here at least
i don’t think there’s any snitches on here but u never know
I was typing it in when timer went
so i cant help u
jk i don’t even remember what it was
Mines still on the calculator
OH
i wish i got a 70, on the ones he messed up on i got 4 and 3, so if we continue the streak
on the whole test
crazy bc it’s a chemistry exam but u know
We didn’t learn that
Like wtf
Omg same
we didn’t do that in 105 at least
nothing on electron config
I feel like that’s probably more likely
But that’s so annoying
the lack of curving is also annoying
this entire chem class is annoying
chem is annoying
i wish chem was more easy less thinking
not when i have to teach myself college chem
time to work on sages i guess
Someone should email him
I just got jumpscared by a really bad zombie banner
cuz now  gotta study for more things
*imagine if u still had chem to do*
If you don’t look at the grade it can’t hurt you
RIP yall
I still have a writing portfolio to submit in my sages class
I really need to add more RAM to my laptop, I got too used to 16 GB on my desktop and now 8 GB isn't enough for 50+ chrome tabs, IntelliJ, Discord, and Anki to be open simultaneously
Have you tried this website: https://downloadmoreram.com/
bruh i tried downloading ram but nothing happened
@envoke can you upload the ram to google drive and share it with me; it seems as if I cannot download ram directly from the site
Chrome sucks so much
Firefox > Chrome > litterally anything else > internet explorer
it’s not that bad
I don’t really use the points
i remember firefox being really annoying when i used to use it :thonk:
my last two are on monday
I have achieved 93 and 100 on my finals
not yet 😦
idk why I was feeling like hot shit like it wasn't a big deal at all tbh
i was probably trying to justify my chem grade
maybe i just wanna work in virgina so I can constantly scream the lyrics of country roads take me home
why are all of the world's shittiest places just two and a half hours from each other smh
I mean tbh I can drive about an hour from seattle and see confederate flags so I guess everything just kinda sucks
"everything just kinda sucks"
u have a car right howdy
Omg project 4 correctness grade is just sad
raunak sad he got 99/10 instead of 100/100 smh
This one is really bad
Howdy you dumb fuck, he got an 89/100
Wtf
idk if someone says "it's really bad" it's always a bit below 90, it means that they care about their grades and won't get an A
other than that, us underacheiviers don't give enough shits to complain about academics
its really bad is when its a 20/100
it's a big fat ope when its a 20/100
which i got 10 above, so its only kinda bad
gotta do it over the satilite tho
Howdy and I did late night more code back in cle during the lockdown
howdy lived like, on the opposite end and one floor above that guy but still heard him
Ah shit
I was supposed to live there🥲
idk how many 2025 people we have so far
Ah shit I’ll have the boomer tag in that server
@raunakwastaken ikr I can’t believe time went by so fast
It feels like I was the one asking the class of 23’ers about case 😂
It feels like yesterday I was applying to colleges
@sprinkles2108 ik feels like yesterday
sometimes i wish we could just know where we'd end up and only have applied there
all that stress for nothing
Woah crazy how time keeps going
Hate to see it
i did not think
i was wondering *who* it was
smh my head
shaking smh my head
bio was the last one
i didn't mc was bad
honestly I feel like I did equally meh on both
im really scared for the frqs
cuz those are very subjective
sorry lemme rephrase that
ah shit now I feel even worse about it
Aww you guys are getting over with your finals
i shouldve said uhhh ik flamingos are eukaryotes but how else was i supposed to depict this smh
I prolly have to go and get my blood tested
Cause this fever ain’t leaving
are you still really sick?
oh no
Bader didn't wanna give me a 50/50 on the E for E simbio?
grades are due tomorrow for bader
rip
apparently
it's the best one apparently
The "grades due deadline" isn't a strict deadline. My grade in behavioral economics was due yesterday and I still don't know what score I got on the final
apparently grades for drew's class are due today
Wait how tf is he releasing the grades and I haven’t even taken it yet
I want my 2 points
Wait, is he you allowing you to take it at another time because you were sick during the normal exam time?
tho
Bruh im sick as shit
that exam wasnt terrible but watch me still not get the grade i need
imma cry
i got the flu just before the PSAT
fuck the PSAT
and missed the semi-finalist score by just a little
idk how u Asians do it
I hate being classified as Asian
no matter how many times i told my parents to SHUT UP before the exam they STILL talked during my exam
obv i didnt say shut up
"Mother, father, please would you be so kind as to shut the hell up while I fail this test? Danke"
Pri are you really that stupid?
they're not classified that way yet
cuz that's like saying latinx-americans aren't hispanic wtf?
In job applications and college applications you have “Indian Americans” while I have to go with “Asians” which lowers my chances
i dont recall there being an indian american option on the common app
or maybe there was idk
Priyanka is pretty but a dead giveaway lol
he could've left it at 45 and i would've vibed
why wouldn't you want more points
you need to revise one of your essays in which you got a 47/50 or below
nope 25 points are toward the quality of our revisions made
stupid
Oh shit
Don’t tell him
too late
the wall is broken
Oh lord
starting in October I could see you die a little inside every time she said it
Mam you yourself can’t pronounce my name correctly.
Too bad we won’t hear it again
@djsurti idk
You serious? 😂😂
i havent watched that
Neel brought dinosaur nuggets to your class ?
I never thought I would hear an adult say "dino nuggies" that many times in 2 minutes
Someone get that man some dino nuggies
u cut out
im single but go off
YOU CANT EVEN PRONOUNCE YOUR OWN NAME???
really?
i aint in any relationship
just wanted to know the situation back there
I got good grades and all that. But I just wanted to know my chances
its not a chance me , it's just as I'm an interantional with low efc and no test score, I'm just confused
a man after raunak's heart
I feel like college admissions is random though
Oh 100%
@ami_nizum8078 I read your “chance me,” you seem very accomplished! :)
i know some bengali tho
Especially now since finals are over I’ve got nothing to do so
sorry :/
I didn’t apply to those lol
i'm not even capping she is iced upp
Sure! I was just trying to compare myself with that specifc situation! Like i though 10k is low af
smh my head zhanda
@kaori_flute can you sponsor my college tuition?
also rip Barbara Snyder
i'm broke
sowwy
without queen
i don’t know how it would work for international students but even w my family contributing very little, local scholarships be saving my ass
Can't give you queen odds, that was stressful
Also last night I dreamt that I was in 3 consecutive plane crashes for some reason
last night i dreamed about a dragon
My dreams have been dark lately
The day before I dreamt that I was executed for cheating on an exam
i dreamed about *sleeping* thru the exam
im trying to find high qual so i can add it to the 2025 server
there’s no way julia doesn’t have that image
I don’t have it😭😭😭
I low key want nitro to use all my emotes :cocoyyell:
(PLEASE DONT)
@quintus_fabius_ we were in math 122
sorry my man I bad with names
install aoe 2 and I won't forget
area of effect seems cooler
oh no
i miss her :sadcat3:
I have a sages portfolio due at midnight and I work until 9 pm
I have. 5 page essay due at 5 om and I haven’t started
mine was due last night, i started typing at 9pm and didnt stop till 11:58
Oh my gosh that’s horrible :(((( I hope they get better!
My one hand is kind of comically larger than the other one and it’s kind of hilarious because it doesn’t really hurt? It’s just like an allergy to something
Some people have finals on Monday
Iirc grades are due December 18th
I doubt that I'm actually going to get my CS grade by then. Only 50 percent of my projects are actually graded and a lot of pre-labs and labs aren't either, and I find it difficult to believe that they will all be graded in a week
Me too. I’m really nervous about my chem and bio finals
Release the energy into the world which you want back 🧘‍♂️
Nah the bio frqs are probably gonna screw me over watch that happen
I do but the world usually doesn’t return the favor🥲
0: that sound sterrible. Either you ace or fail all at once if cri both ways lol
The labs are literally just a participation grade and I know I got all of the pre-labs right so the only real uncertainty left are my grades for Project 4 and 5 and the Final Exam. On the other hand, those three things make up half of my total grade 💀
But the alrdy completed part is missing about 35 credits lol
i just went through it
Plus what I self study
So it didn't overwhelm me
But honestly then I get too little of anything and I find it easier to self study math in general
I conjectured in one my papers last year they could out compute quantum computers
All in all the major doesn't have the depth to even touch anything close to "natural computing" or "digital physics" it's more a statement of purpose to whoever I'm applying to to work or study at next
Awww
I doubt it tho
@inexorablesalmon so what is a geospatial computer, or what is the aim of your major, it looks very interesting but it'd be awesome if you could pitch it, I don't understand it from your reqs
im still the owner
just not aesthetically cuz i dont wanna get @ constantly
you couldnt if you tried
fair
There isn’t a horny jail chat tho
shit
@quintus_fabius_ GSC is simply a quantum computer the computes against, or takes into account the underlying structure of the universe, it's "space" if you will.
AH SORRY
Lol idk what that os
I posit the universe is just one huge such computer
Oh err
uhhhh i am very lost
@inexorablesalmon ok that took me a hot minute to wrap my head around and i'm still pretty lost. I'm a quite confused about how you could understand the relationship between topology and information processing by studying chemical systems.
chemical systems are generally small scale and from what i understand, space time curvature isn't very influential at that scale
my explorer broke
In one school of digital physics (mine)
Alberto do you happen to know Michael ?
The best quantum systems to study
he doesnt like pings
tho he doesnt turn them off
So now im curious, what's the rationale behind your belief that this specific model is the correct one?
That in hand with issues I currently have with our standard model trying to fit to maths bc it's pretty or sophisticated instead of being motivated in all parts by physical intuition
I don't like the s.m. At all
I do know that information is increasingly more important in physics but damn man we're sooo far from using that type of thing for computing maybe these dudes at the lhc first need to understand more stuff
@howdy_. I want my role back
what anjali is doing is unforgivable tho
thanks king ❤️ but i wish
who wants to take chem 106
study for the proficiency exam w me
You’re trying to test out of 106?
106 got sm work
I NEED A GENIUS TO TEACH ME
I don’t know how I’m gonna get through another sem of drew
wt class did you SI for michael?
Yeah rip
Oh dang
Either that or biol 321
its so important tho!!
same michael can I still attend the SIs
@inexorablesalmon I've had random students attend my sessions pre-COVID because my vibes were good but post-COVID I can't really have that :(
rip
aw
damn
@anjalir519 shame
I will peer pressure anyone who doesn't have their camera on haha
what?? anjali I've never seen you look bad
Bahahahaa OMG WTH NO FALSE
@bravo5127 its cuz she doesnt wanna share cliff
Imma be real I just haven’t worn real clothes in like a month I just have only worn pjs
or still no no
Oh the research lab?
We’ll see lol I’m kinda scared cz it’s gonna just be me in isolation basically
Is that the exception you described? Because I couldn’t come up with anything
I DONT LIVE TOOOOO FAR
~~I didn’t get a chance to pick a lab because I left the bme profs on read~~ :((((((
I hate life sometimes
only since quarantine
RIP
OML IM NOT ALONE THEN PHEWWWW
I realized
I literally threw away research bro
I threw it away
I didn’t wanna do computational stuff
I compiled everything my professor wanted
I met someone at the research fair who like said he had a job and told me to reach out and I didn’t like his research or find it interesting so I just didn’t?
Still feel bad tho
I said I’d learn and do the work and he replied and then I never responded because something happened
Yeah I didn’t wanna do the computational stuff whatsoever
My friend went to the discussions booth and then she dipped cz I think she saw ryan and thought he looked intimidating
Agreed I just wanted to be in an actual lab
We don't talk about Ryan.
yeah I don't see it
Just appearance alone?
I didn’t bahahaha I was just scared cz there wasn’t any other freshmen
we can't force you
I didn’t even have to do any work for that recruitment
Cz I’m recruiting already
it's so much fun you don't even know
large time commitment tho
only sad part
Or yelling about the SUNSHINE LINE I WANTED TO KEEP
Yeah we just meet once a week basically and edit the papers we accepted, so you don’t have to edit alone
I don’t blame y’all
Really?
Oh no wth
nope
I hate arguments
It’s not serious or anything
Or someone else
Oh
Grace the math si is different
oh
Grace is an SI for math 121
I wanna be an SI for math 126
I don’t know though
I wanted to be a bio SI
IT LIKE DID THO? isn’t that the one we ended up keeping
Same though I don’t even know if I’ll get an A in bio this final is stressing me outttt
Becca had a really good argument and I didn't even count my own vote honestly, I just did for funsies
Because you need an A to be an SI
Oh yeah my A went out the window and even if I did get an A I wouldn’t be confident enough
I thought after the first test I could but that went downhill quickly
Still outvoted 🙂
I’d rather be a chem SI I love chem it’s just that Drew and Covid hate me
I suck at bio
I HATE CHEM lemme tell you
90% of my energy went into bio
I couldn’t focus so much on chem
And internally crying
HOW DID IT TAKE ME A WHOLE SEMESTER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STUDY
I had 450 pages in my notebook by the end of them sem
Idk
Not a single bit of it was useful either
Oh
My notes came in clutch when studying
I never drew diagrams
I wish I ingested them enough tbh
I wish I had that memory
Me but in chem girl. I wish we had a good textbook to reference
All I missed in chem were small details on the multiple choice
Yep realized that over break
I was like nope
Me reading this having taken 30 pages of notes for all my classes this semester 👁️👄👁️
Yeah, and most of them were for chemistry. I created a few text files on my computer for Java but I never looked at them again because the professor's lecture notes were better.
I realize that this strategy isn't going to work next semester though
I never took notes in math so bio balanced it out @_frostyyyyy_
There is just so much wrong with that video
Also don't buy gross 75/25 beef
Just don’t eat beef
anything with more fat and less meat is for stuff that needs more fats
who is woke :eyes2:
classical music haters won't join though
Won’t join what?
u still have compsci?
I didn’t take it
what do you call somebody with no body and just a nose
No body nose
no body nose
Eye sea
Jenin do you have a nose?
wootttt we don't have the brane emote
@anjalir519 do you have a nose?
@chandachan do you have a nose?
everyone has a nose except for voldemort
You can’t assume things like that
that we need
Voldemort here take this nose
Lmao how sad is it that we’ve reached the point where we’re talking about noses
Nose is underrated
Let us all be inclusive to nose
No(se)❤️
Anti maskers when you ask them to cover they nose
Rip
The number of times I’ve put in worst exam scores and just cried
Oh ur doing it wrong
I just learned that I can skip the essay portion and miss 10 questions on the psych final and get an A
Considering that it’s just a 101 class I don’t even care much if I got less than an A, I just don’t wanna do the essay lol
and still being able to get an a
Can't get anxiety if your professor doesn't bother to set up Canvas properly and the grading it shows is completely wack 😎
One of my professors this semester didn't even use Canvas to show grades at all
we didnt even have a canvas page
oh
lol didn’t think of out of 100
Oh gosh
The psychology professor is so bad with canvas that I almost wish she didn’t use it
i emailed my sages professor my final essay asking for revision suggestions and he was like nah looks good final grade A
i was like damn shawty ok 🥺
Anatomy prof gave us a box and whisker plot summary and boy that shit was depressing
She used to put bar graphs so you could see actual percentiles but I guess she stopped
oh
It’s great way to make someone super happy or super sad lol
Before Drew put a static midterm grade as the main grade in Canvas, he had to tell people to ignore the grade that Canvas was showing them because he set it up wrong and it was showing some people really low grades
I don’t see why profs wouldn’t want to use canvas, it seems p simple compared to non canvas options
What a weird college
How much you wanna bet it’s someone in this discord
Feel like I already said that
I have a feeling you know who it is
Nah I don’t use Instagram
I need antibodies
All ties should be cut after every major milestone in life
I need antibodies otherwise my mom won’t let me come
Sigh
Has science ruled out that you can’t get it again
As long as you have antibodies you can’t
Antibodies don’t last forever do they?
They don’t
U go and volunteer every few months in their positive ward
Tell her no one here gives a crap anymore
I will be shocked if I don’t contract covid
The long term effects are so terrifying that I refuse to be caught slipping
Aw :(
I’m dealing with being stupid
If Covid extends til next fall I will sue this whole country
It probably will tho lol
If I can’t go to campus
When my parents go out
I’m like PEACEFUL WORK TIMEEEEE
My door is broken so I can’t lock is lol
My parents both work full days so it’s not loud it’s just that the mindset I have at home just doesn’t work with learning
I’m not allowed to lock my door
If my bro were back at home I’d be getting negative work done
I don’t know why
Dunno why parents hate locked doors
I’m not allowed to have my door completely closed all the way either
Like I promise whatever u think is happening isn’t
I don’t even work in my room anymore
I work downstairs
Don’t have space to work in my room but I wish I did
Horrible boy :banhammer:
My parents never stop being sus of me
Parents are weird
The few times I’ve locked the door on them they had a Riot
I don’t have my own bathroom though
Not allowed to lock that either
Damn
If something happened
You don’t lock your bathroom??? Wth
They should be able to get in
Then no need to have the door always unlocked for emergencies
I just don’t
I mean I think a lot of houses you just need a paperclip to unlock the door
Yea inner house locks don’t need to be crazy secure
Don’t think I’m allowed to so no
Yeah I can’t lock the door because
What kind of thin scissors would you need for that??
Like kid my sister needs something from the cabinets
No doors without locks bit you can
Then she can’t get in
And she’d be pissed
I don’t know man my parents are mostly chill but have weird rules
I feel that
doesn't give them the right to violate your privacy like that
Bruh didnt you say your sister was taking precal and she out here needing a chair.to.reach the cabinet
To this day they still track my location
Apparently
But he never tells me
oh nvm
My dad tried location tracking but then he needed help setting it up lmao
Oh now I do
My parents trust me but they don’t trust me if you know what I mean
I don’t going out SO MUCH that it’s concerning
Though
That happened junior year lol
Wanted to go again two weeks later or so
just explain how you feel
I can talk to my parents for hours about my concerns and issues, get an ok, and then Nothing
You’re only allowed to go out once a month?? How are you supposed to even meet all your friends
When I told my parents how some of their rules was why I couldn’t have much fun in elementary/middle school they went “well we didn’t mind you hanging out with people it’s just that you didn’t have many friends”
I mean there’s only 3 of them so I don’t have to keep going out
Saves me money too
how are you supposed to make friends if you can't go out that much?
Idk lol
I didn’t have many friends in hs anyway because people sucked
Never heard of that method
Like you can’t call 15 of them together. You need to be able to go out multiple times
like my friends would come visit me when I was stuck working at Five Below
Dude I didn’t even have 10 friends lmaooooo
I was friendly with everybody in high school, but I didn't have many close friends
Damn you cold bruh
Damn we nobody to Ronnie 🥲🥲
I mean my friendships are low maintenance but I invest a lot in them, don’t have the time to do that with more than 10 people
Damn
Damn
It's a cold cold.world
Nah I’m used to it
Wel one isn’t even in here anymore lol
Oh the other left?
But we talk a shit ton
In school
Didn’t you go to a catholic school
Colouring books are sick
Nah those are too much work
I don’t have shit to do with my friends to be going out with them frequently
Sorry stockings
well unless your kid was a being a massive shit
he wanted anthrasite coal in paricular
My aunt asked what I wanted for Christmas and I was like ??? Money duh
I mean I already have everything I want
what else do I need really?
but they won't
Santa just isn’t smart enough for that unfortunately
Didn’t study economics in college
Santa doesn’t exist
Santa is not real sorry guys
He didn’t study economics
That everyone being able to pay necessities frees up money for the economy
my personal economic opinion is that Keysnian Economics isn't a theory
If only I studied economics in college 😔
Rip
I don’t know
So idk
i never learned econ :))
But also didn’t
we had budgeting classes in middle school
Close enough
never took an actual course on how to budget teehee
3 hours and 25 minutes to go
Or just leave it
Those junior achievement 1 day programs didn’t do anything but waste time
I don’t think so but yea there’s a chance
Oh they go to cwru?
Don’t make friends Bruh
We need to beat them up
Plus police won’t catch us we support Modi
Isn’t that right raunak!
look at Modi’s beard tho
I saw someone wear a blue lives flag cloth on their face today
Nothing wrong with the american flag
It’s almost like it never was about the flag
is it wrong that I don't see anything special about a flag?
Those people who be wearing them damn gaiters and the top half only goes up to the neck
But that doesn’t matter to them 😁
this isn't nationalism Ray GUo
Not them now crying about the election and wanting election reform. Guess they hate America now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Even the Supreme Court said dude you lost give up
even being dead can't save you from being a target of a conspiracy
This apparently is JFK JR
Trying to figure out their logic will physically hurt your body
fair enough

Oh
spoons is a terrible game
the rum is where you left it

@raunakwastaken you missed meeting one of KNOWER’s members on their discord server
and I'm gone
I can’t believe I’m being doubted when I’m real life angel
Not my fault you don’t see the evil in them
and we told u u aint
But u haven’t even asked my friends yet
Gdi I thought she was gone
nop, you can never get rid of them
Fuck
cyberpunk is polished yet
don't buy either
how bad they b?
y'all just saying, "where ever i go, its meme channel" would be a great idea, but don't think its approved yet
My man Joey Burrow isn't sus though. He's a pure man
He just doesn't have most of the ligaments in his leg right now
TL is extra cringe because he said "HIUBSEIODFUBSEOUFBOSEI LET uS pLaY" and then got covid immediately, was out for 2 weeks, and then Clemson lost because they're overrated af
I didn't like him
I never really liked Andy Dalton either
He just never could get it done
No he's shit he's got a real O line
JB doing it without an O line
Hate big ben
Hate Lamar Jackson
I would like him if he wasn't bad and didn't type like a cat stomping on a windings keyboard
Hate Tua
Derrick Henry might as well run through the gut every time and watt won't do anything
all these folks talking about flash dying. Imagine not having a spare old copy of firefox or internet explorer to play flash games with
Shazier was great before he got hurt
they got off the field issues though :/
Oh fuck how could I forget Michael Thomas
But Michael thomas isn't as good as megatron
and turned wide receiver
JT Barrett didn't go NFL
Haskins has an ungodly cannon of an arm but he just can't control where it goes
ya'll need to kiss my mfing ass and go to michigan
Dan Marino went to Pitt but go off
all i can really think of off the top of my head is steve jobs
obama was in harvard tho
guy fieri is from ohio case closed 🙄☝️
@apollo2116 sorry for pinging everyone
Oh
Don’t ever talk football
Okudah has struggled heavy. I put a lotta blame on the god awful scheme Detroit ran under Patricia. They be playing press man coverage but weren’t allowed to jam... which makes about as much sense as Zhanda typing
Nothing like waking up at 10:30 am with zero responsibilities😌
As long as I didn’t have to do that essay :naenae: :naenae:
If I get any B’s I will cry internally for a very long time
I’m so scared for bio and chem y’all don’t even know
For now though we dunno for sure
I need 6.9 GPA
I need that 4.20 GPA
I miss hs when my gpa was somewhere around there
But college doesn’t offer more weighted courses
Hard to tell wit how fucking stupid u be at times cuh
What if drew doesn’t reply to my email 💀💀
I think the syllabus is just wrong, it’s a low level bio class
I need that automatic A if he doesn’t reply
My sages prof made an annotation in my portfolio but I can’t find ittttt
I can fuck up more
I don’t prefer anything
Whereas someone else could have a 95+ GPA
Would hate for that option to disappear
I’m worried about my bio and chem grades because bio is on the edge and chem is mehhh but I studied really hard for that chem final
OH
Wow I forgot about sages
Then sages is the only class that I don’t know my final grade
Not my fault u can’t read
My sister is at school
But crap it’s already 11 am
Looks like I can take the final anytime on any day I want
Damn
I chose never
I wish then I’d give myself an A
Y’all need to stop deleting your texts
Please don’t let me down :(
Oh no
Stay in school don’t do drugs
*except caffeine*
Don’t follow Raunak’s advice
Not Anymore
No I don’t
He would never
Dhananjay I haven’t seen you in 2 weeks now. Come to India so we can catch up
He didn’t
Nope
I mean we’re all young so we can develop any accent we want
It’s hard to develop tho
Fair
I hate the American accent because wherever I go in the world people will assume I’m dumb
Because Europeans think Americans are stupid
Apparently Oxford is working with Russia for a combined vaccine
FAX THO
Chase Young was crazy yesterday though
Mad max steals the guitar and starts hitting people with it
Ok bois chem final in 12 hours 😢
Wtf
I deadass can’t tell when Zhanda is trolling or not
I've had enough of my Mac, I'm getting a new laptop. I wanna be able to play video games
if you want to play games you probably should get a windows computer with a graphics card
@samrobot but i need a new laptop tho
get new laptop and install Linux
which new laptop tho
yeah I want to avoid Dell too
Unless the laptop has a graphics card, it won't be able to run many modern games well
How does one know, if laptop has card
I don't really care too much for high-demand games, I just wanna be able to play Civ V lol
The one game I tried running on my ThinkPad was Civ VI and it ran at like 20 FPS on low settings and was hot and loud
I wouldn't recommend it if you want to game even occasionally
idk
I am now able to play on my own
hp I think is the only one that doesn't have the contract with intel
amd has been killing intel when it comes to laptop processors
No reason literally no reason I’m not even taking o chem for another semester
I just wanted to
Where’d you find the material?
OH
So I have lots of notes but they’re all boring powerpoints
My school never offered o chem🤪
And I wanted to see if I could make some study guides early
bruh i took my pharm final today and my prof is trying to get the grades out by tonight 💀
i took an only multiple choice exam last week and the grades still arent up 😭
I had a C average on exams 🙂
Our grade was just so boosted because it was the hardest class in school and so I ended up with a B in the end
I don’t think we can
Oh bruh
OH ME TOOO
no u dont get it
bc ochem for nurses is literally so stupid LMAOO
Yeah idk what it’s like to be smart
Oh
oooo scary numbers so scary
But how is it stupid
idk it was just
like ok ms professor if i walk up to any rn in the hospital and ask them to draw out the structure of lysine, they would not be able to do it
and she still was like memorize these for ur exam
Like if for some reason I forgot, I would just need to go get the resources fo figure it out?
Ugh
Couldn’t be me
are u taking a j term class
I'm taking a philosophy/neuroscience class. I'm going to test out of Calc 3
Like take the placement exam
Oh me too
I couldn't get into the Calculus 3 in January so I'll do it myself
I’m not scared
I finished my sophomore year of Hs and I wanted to teach but there was politics in our dojo and I couldn’t
NEVER
Wtf 😂😂
Am I wrong though
But I won’t bring a tennis racquet to fight her
Nothing
@_frostyyyyy_  u can do placement exams after first semester? for calc 3??
black belt? damn
brown belt? damn
that class will fuck you up if you're not careful
my dad taught me how to fight then I got in trouble for fighting so I never fought again
wish i had a sibling that i could fight
I won’t have to study chem ever again after 6 hours😌😌 @anjalir519
DAMN
HOW DO YOU FEEL RANOOK ROASTED
Anjali pls don’t cry when you lose
Not required for CS majors anymore
fuck that
Really
@_frostyyyyy_ that's great, u gotta email someone? also, if I don't pass I can just still take the class this spring right?
Why do you need chem then?
Yeah, if you don't pass then you have to take the class. Search CWRU math proficiency exam on Google to find it
We’ll see tho I don’t think I have space to take it
My current major or majors? Are so varied I don’t even know what I have to take anymore
oh boi I thought those exams were only for first semester
Dead you’re dead
Ehhh not so much anymore
Same I hate drama
lol nothing happened
damn just gunning right for me huh anjali
I sit on the sidelines and sip the tea but never make it you know
I mean I’m just wondering
Not that there will be any since I heard it’s pretty dead
I wanna know 110% of everything that’s going on on campus but don’t wanna be part of any of it
@zackt7718 browns suck
nope
Meh, I respect everyone’s views as long you don’t force it on me
ty <3 but that isn't most of CWRU
There are some views that I don’t respect sometimes
If you support Donald trump it’s fuck you. I stand by what I say
Like if you just hate me as a person I probably won’t respect that view you know?
Fair
Though I doubt michael is that
If you a Republican it’s whatever we disagree on political shit. But supporting trump? You don’t care about basic human rights
Oh nah
I don’t think that was fighting lmaoooo
I want popcorn now tho
Screw the Indian left
That dude can’t stop coughing bro
I don’t make the rules
Raunak mourns Nehru’s death everyday
Aight I’m going back to chem(which I’m taking for the last time @anjalir519 )
What do you have to study?
do you need a mod to ban you from this server to study?
I really have an 89.88 in a class
RIP
But I thought 111 exam was at same time as ours?
Which class?
OHHH YOU GOT SICK
I forgot whoops
Like deadass all the points we lost was cuz of them
This is the last week
Cuz grades are being put in
also, has anyone gotten any chem grades back yet?
doesn't matter
Nope, no grade back
and give you grades you barely don't deserve
doesnt count
Then no I got nothing
Drew doesn’t play that game though idt
other professors though 👀
It sucks, I'm only friends with professors out of my major 😦
someone who wants to go to grad school
Me crying about my bio grade yes is gpa whore behavior
Same though
I’m v scared
aren't they all doctors at the end of the day?
Med school is technically a form of grad school?
if your prefix is "doctor," it's grad school
Email has been sent Ima be Lowkey mad if .12 points stop me from getting all A’s bruh
Flex I wish I was that smart
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I don’t even know if I’ll have all A’s Kms
I didn’t cry I promise
All my classes are finalized except bio and chem
oh you were referring to your bio grade :/ sorry
Nah bio hasn’t been out in
Bio is taking FOREVER
Math 121
I am just ordinarily bad at math
sorry
I’m sorry :(((((
And him not giving partial credit made it worse
So rip to that gpa
Who wants to help plan the funeral
Though idt most cwru students have a 4.0 right?
funeral for your 4.0 or was it a genuinely bad grade
Most do or don’t?
no I would be very sad too about it
Most DONT
My nspire came in clutch on them exams. Like it was so nice for some problems just getting them out the way
@anjalir519 Are you taking MATH 122 or MATH 126 next semester?
Idk if I should feel better now
I’m very scared for chem
And I don’t have to take any other classes it’s a prerequisite for
@anjalir519 I completely understand though, getting a B when you're used to As and actually suffered through the semester sucks so much.
If I don’t get an A in chem then I’ll just have to suck it up and improve and show med schools I’m a hard worker and pull a Covid card
I've heard that grad schools usually care more about your last two years in college
Chem is not guaranteed at all and I don’t think bio is either
@chandachan Myles got hurt this game is over bra
pre med sucks, don't it?
oh
yo I'm on 4 1/2 hrs of sleep
I can't without destroying my sleeping schedule
need to stay up for at least 3 more hrs
I relate to that though
I don’t know what Michael looks like at all
I don’t follow you on there
doesn't he look like mowgli
She also says she is stupid
ITS CRYING FOR THERAPY
Seeing as she goes to CWRU ** **** *********** she isn’t dumb
Why won’t asterisks go more than four wtf
I don’t have an 88 rn I wish
i'm still waiting on that final score

I failed the second exam
Not a hurt b fail
I need a 91.4 to get an A🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I did worse on E3
I need a 68 on the final to get an A but I'm not feeling great about it
but he replaces your lowest exam score
OUCH
Goodbye 4.0
I’m so stupid
To figure out how to study
@sprinkles2108 what’s ur major tho
Oh ok idk Med school haha
Doubt 1st sem freshman year COVID Bs r relevant tho
There’s a whole gpa they ask for that accounts for your science and math courses
Idk
it sucks
Bio chem math physics
nothing on final recorder sheet
oh grad schools don’t really look at whole GPA idk about Med school
I need an 80 on the CS final tomorrow to get an A. Just watch me get a 77 🤡
wrong zack
I’m gonna pull a Covid card if I have to
Chase Claypool bout ugly as shit
I wish med schools were like that
Covid card is getting it for me
My boy Juju cold
i mean, how tf you gon get a professor reference without doing research with them?
Nah JuJu a bitch tho
I have like 14 wtf
I have nothing to post and I don't like showing my face
I mean I will have to take them for my other major but not like hard hard ones again?
So you won't say the same about cam newton
I’m trying to spread them out a lot
but you out here telling juju to grow the fuck up ?
Cam Newton got drip. JuJu and Claypool got nothing
shame on you
I have like 22 STEM classes still required in 7 semesters so I need to do 3 classes every semester minimum
JuJu dont got drip like that don’t speak on Cam’s name
That gif tho
Omg

Since you.arrived
Cough is gone bitch boy
Why? What do you want to skip ahead to?
Going home from work
Oh
Or an SI for MATH 126
For math
Cause they don’t do shit
I was considering trying to become a TA for CS until I realized that it would be a nightmare
I think I wanna be an SI for math 126 but dunno if they’re hiring
your math professor
I haven’t talked to him much
The MATH 122 TAs didn't know how to solve a lot of the problems I asked them
The TAs in math are nice but I didn't learn much from them
I would regularly talk to one of them for like an hour each week for several weeks
Nah ud just cry about how dumb  u r
I tutor people in math
i feel like priyanka is one of them kumon people
I’ve never been to a kumon-like service
Don’t work for corporate companies
Same though
Seeing "stonks" reminds me that I've actually lost money since I started trading stocks...
Or has theirs gone down too
I tried to play with leveraged and inverse ETFs and leveraged inverse ETFs during the beginning of the pandemic and got burned
Since then, I've just put everything into a NASDAQ 100 ETF
PS: coffee didn’t help me stay awake
I only trade ETFs though
I just saw that fuck
Sorry David
I don't trade options like some people I know
Holy shit
You lost dem stacks
I don’t even have $2k in my account LOLLL
I’m a broke college kid
Because I don’t have a life
I invest most of my money
Use that parent's money 💸
I want to invest when the economy is better
I worked for a solid year and could either buy a car or a stage piano
They make me spend their money when I want to spend mine
I ended up saving so much money by buying it used that I was able to get another workstation keyboard as well
Don’t spend it and keep working
I haven’t earned a single penny in my life
David, don’t pressure yourself too much
David I don't think you need a graduate degree in economics to navigate the stock market so you got it bro
David Ricardo didn't even go to college and he made BANK
Yeah due to birthday money and money from family visitors. I know Indian culture man
You didn’t get it. Smh
No he still has money
Oh no

LMAOOOO yessss though I’d die of cringe
There’s like 5 cut shots
Where can we find some pirated Indian drama
You didn’t know durkio????
anyone wants to play tetris?
i'll have to defean myself tho
i'm horrible at it hehe
bruh
still
can't
alright my wrist hurts
i watched u play once and u were bad
ur pissed
nothing much
It’s too early to be up
isnt it over today/?/
too slow
If yes then that vpn sucks
Aren't the last finals today?
People on campus
Have they turned on the heating in your rooms?
still hard af
What class?
ok not that hard
never take it
don't do it
unless you want to spend ~20hrs/week modeling
I don't regret taking it but lordy lord don't take it
scary
I got another grade today
When someone said their final exam score went up by 17 points I died a little on the inside
I just got my last grades in SAGES and I hope that I'm doing my calculations correctly because it looks like a miracle
Oh rip I had mine go up by 18
I think it’s 3 questions tho
No no you don’t understand
I just genuinely don’t know
Things are then looking really bad for me
I can't believe I'm actually going to get a 4.0 after panicking for the entire semester
I feel really mentally paralyzed right now
Imma cry
So what's the situation with the bio exam
Which is terrible news for me
Nope
That’s what happened with most people
Well if I could I would but I can't
Getting 5 on both seems unlikely to me
It can happen
But this exam was the worst too
This was my worst exam yet
you can't change it
As long as your grades aren’t objectively awful it’s NBD
I really feel like some med schools really won’t give an f
They’ll be like ok people were dying but did you get an A in bio and chem? No? Lol sorry
it's not by biden iirc, it's the school presidents
Call me an optimist but I don’t think med schools are gonna punish you that harshly for a couple B’s your first semester where almost everything was remote due to a pandemic ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i'm still waiting on drew
drew, release the fucking grades
Oh you’d be surprised
To use a chem analogy, the residency spots is the limiting factor, they kinda need to guarantee that you can get into a residency program after you graduate med school
Otherwise you wasted 8 years for nothing
They can increase med school seats but if there aren't any residency spots that's not going to work
I’m bored and anxious rn and it’s not a good combo
Which doesn’t get much funding
So by rejecting so many people the med schools are actually potentially saving them from wasting their time and money and not being able to get a residency?
I guess so
They really do
I don’t know if that many people struggled tho
Bruh that language tho
Don't think 4.0 is possible after freshman year, just sayin
If you only had one bad semester
Then the Covid card will work
I would put significant money that the average and median GPA was lower this semester than most semesters
If I explained to you what happened just now in bio you’d know
And I’ll just start crying
Fair. I can bet people have cheated on the bio exams
It was 3 hours, no?
Which I don't
I don’t trust anyone enough to collaborate during exams
I haven't been to Whataburger in probably a year
I don't go to restaurants anymore
Covid-19 and I don't have enough time
It's kinda hard to write the exact same lines of code
someone that is interested in coding but still wants to study, say, classics
Advanced anti-cheating software catches this. Some professors use software that checks bytecode/machine code instead of Java code that doesn't care what your variable names are
But that requires Connamacher to compile it which he clearly isn't
even if he wanted to
he couldnt
Well he grades on the code because I bet half of our code didn't even compile for the midterm
im slow, thats why
Because of maybe a missing semicolon or syntax error or what not
my code couldnt compile even if i wanted it to
But if the same missing semicolon shows up in another person's thing and they have the same idiosyncrasies then it's pretty clear they cheated
don't speculate
I don’t want to speculate
heck, i've just been building my game for the last two days
School creeps back into my head
And sends me down a hole of internally freaking out about my exam
*exams
Sorry Michael
OMG THATS ME BUT WITH BECOMING A DOCTOR AWWWW
Unfortunately, no
Just stupid stuff like clean and organize
Imagine cleaning
My room has looked like a complete mess for months 🤡
My floor’s clean
There’s a mountain of clothes on my footboard though
I’m a neat-freak so I don’t
Don’t get me wrong
But I’m stuck at home
Oh, you didn't get housing?
I didn’t opt into the waitlist
well if ya didn't apply
I didn’t bother to knowing my parents would talk me into staying at home
Can't get denied for housing if you didn't apply 😎
You never applied?
Really?
oh yeah, i wanna go back to melt
I’ll be too sad over my self-destruction to visit methinks
I need so much room
I work in my dining room lol
I couldn’t even handle my study
Oh
I will take the chem exam for you in exchange
i don't
For sages tho?
Mines not that either
Oh
Nope not even
An English class?
Cuz I was the only student in the class
i did it last semester
I can't fit it tho :(
Cuz class gives me a boner :( and idw leave college w.o certain 1s
I took 18 credits this semester and it was hell at some points, I can't imagine 19+ every semester
So really 16
Exam
Alberto I had a really smol brain moment in bio today man I can’t test out of 106
What happened
You had class??
Ugh it’s too hard to explain
Well when applied to maths specifically
Japanese, Racquetball, Creative Writing, Diff EQ, Game Design, Discrete Math, and Sages
Game design can be killer tho
Esp of youve never used unity b4
I can’t stop laughing
i've LOOKED at unity before
I'm also taking Discrete Math next semester
Couldn’t be me
Damn. Cool!
Uh so what happened was that basically as TA’s grade an FRQ or 2 and save the grade our grade updates (but isn’t finalized). I got an email saying my grade changed today, but it only went up by 10 points, so I thought only one question was graded (because each question is worth 10 points) BUT EVERYONE ELSE’S WENT UP BY MORE THAN 10
Only thai insurance commercials and spirited away
I don’t think so
Aw :(
Guess what I didn’t do
Why does he hate us
no school survey is anonymous
Howdy why is it that while I don't think you have a 4.0
You deserve 1 so bad
I would need to b big brained
This is why I’m never brutally honest
It’s just gonna accurately describe from my pov why this class needs to have its structure changed
The way he acted this sem was not fair on exams and someone should know that
Oh
Still might be
If you didn't log in randos cld j troll
You need to log in because the system needs to see what classes you took
Fair
But the professors can't see who submitted what evaluation
Well it doesn't neeed to you cld j let students pick
Then people would evaluate classes they didn't take
I struggled in this class partially because of Bader’s inconsistent grading
His TA’s are so slow
I can’t lol
Oh
Bahahaha my mom is great but I used to ask her to teach me things and it would turn into a whole lot of crying
Has he released a curve yet?
Oh no my heart
The class is precurved
It’s already a curved class
Oh
If I wreck my A in bio I will simply pass away
I need to get an A
I’m so close
I don’t know
Nope
Damn
Ouch pripri
Sorry sir
8 ball nvr hate me
Time to die
I have not fully yet considered the moral implications of this
All I need is 20
Something about howdys hat makes me want to give him 23 points tho
I NEED IT
I NEED THE POINTS
If 2 frqs got graded already I don’t stand a chance
I'm saying they probably each got 98's in the class
NO WONDER YOUR FIANCÉ FELL FOR YOU ALBERTO😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nope
have they turned on heating in storrs?
*zhanda I need stability*
i'm flying back tomorrow
Aww lolllll
Can I lean on you oh tower of stability
jenin, why dont u go and check
It ain't even cold
my ass finna be on a plane back to TEXAS where it's NOT FUCKING SNOWING
still far too warm
*when* do they turn on heating inside the rooms smhhhhh :sadcat3:
Who is still on campus?
*sorry but i ain't going to texas*
Imagine being on campus still lmaoooooooooooo
I thought that student housing is already empty
Alberto can fly 1st class all he wants
Alberto write my rec letter for med school man
oh lala?
Fuck no
If med school doesn’t work out🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
maybeeee
not actual hopes though
do doctors study for 15 years :thonk:
I think raunak said he wanted a masters and not a PhD
PhDs almost always take longer than 3 years
My family doctor: "A doctor's learning never stops"
Only benefit of a PhD is being able to call yourself a Dr
i mean, whichever field u take, u'll keep studying
Times.the working hours
Why the expanse rated so good but so bad
Apparently
You don't need to start paying student debt
While your in school
Just study forever forehead
The expanse* is terrible
but u dont have any debt :thonk:
Yet
This bio exam might xhange that
OH F
Bader collects hard
pri has ||redacted|| for school
Pri has school ***** **** ***
nothing
I can't live anymore
cuz tv is overrated
Hate it
Home alone 2
I don't hv time 4 those :( 2 long
Idk lol
Oh

Fuck Israel

we simply want human rights 😌
oh lalaaaa
Damn gigi hadid

Apparently I sound “black” which I don’t know what the fuck that means
Damn all my selfies are from when I’m T’d up LMAO
Has zack stopped making English for anyone else
Holy shit I'm quitting English. Today.
I don’t really have an accent
Ohioians don’t usually have an accent
Except for “Ope”
I WANT ME CAWFEE
I WANT WA UH
trust me, asians in texas don't surprise me in the slightest
Asians from california don;'t surprise me either
Why do you have MIT alerts still
But still
i never really moved
You willingly wanted to play with Zhanda
I don’t know maybe
He would’ve murdered you in cold blood
But do we really want to count Toledo
My dad hates Toledo
is toledo worse or is cleveland worse?
Toledo not even close
oh sandusky
Cleveland isn’t that bad besides uhhhh East Cleveland
RIP
So like 2 hours away
Oh.
Skyline Chili is shit
We almost got a restraining order on us by the end tho
Even worse that Alberto’s ex is from there YUCKKKKKK
What went down
I dont drink tho
We won’t snitchhhhh
Oh
oh lala
I’d pulled up to chat T’d up we don’t judge
Is she still there
Nope
Nope
Alberto what happened in cbusssss
WE DONT SNITCH
It happened mostly in Nevada
no it doesn't
It wasn't in Vegas in any case
noo-ho it doesn't
I won’t judge
That shld not be taken out of context
Bruh unless you like emotionally or physically abused them we won’t judge you bruh
You got scared to get clipped?!? Lmao
Either spill it or stop teasing it cuz
Bitch I didn't even tease!!
Maybe in person 1 day tho
So you ate some raspberries ?
Rip bankroll mannnn 😞😞
no becaue you told us that you were shivering uncontrollably while registering for classes, which means you need to do wrap up
Man we really didn’t get the story out of Alberto
Who We got our money on
Why y'all bullying me damn
Nah I got a fresh start again after leave
But nothing shady went on
End
Not that or the other 1 either
So then it ended
So then the title 9 office was like y'all terrible influences on each other and they wanted to file for a restraining somethin something on who knows who's behalf
Fuck you
omg bruh stop teasing
That's the sexuall harassment office ppl
So you were having relationship problems?
Oh
Omg
rip cancer
That never happened
And then the title 9 office got involved
Damn that was a *cancerous* relationship
But it was tho
Idk
Sorry that happened to you
Nothing to be ashamed of brother
But you never said it was emotionally bad
A toxic relationship is different then emotionally abusing someone bruh
I’m sorry for sending you down memory lane
Cuz u brought it up???
Okay fair point
Tbh @sprinkles2108 it's not hard to talk about
Fair but like he didn’t do anything egregious
I wasn’t reading the above messages so I wouldn’t know
Math sheep
Pri so smol smart brain she can't score lower than a 97
Would you kill Raunak
Don't look at me
would you kill me?
I’d air out this whole discord server ong
yeah someone farted and it stinks
This choppa holds nothing back
what class?
Nah air that class out
I’m having another heart attack
I’m sowwy I gotchu tho we’re in this together
It’s okkkk I’m just trying to not nearly cry again
I don’t wanna ruin him I just want him to know he’s gotta do better
tbh it wasn't even the content, it was how he tested us on the content
I probably missed this but why do we have a bot
I get that this is college
When I saw this my heart rate went to 130 BPM
Only to find out that the chemistry grades weren't released 🤣
so we can't email him to try and round up
... I didn't get any notifications 🤡
Nope
imagine having notifications turned on
i did not and i didnt go both mean no tho
head hurty
this conversation is too englishy 
i don't understand :)
The problem with answering "Yes" or "No" to "Didn't you go to the cinema?" is that it's ambiguous what either one means
really ?
it died before people could agree or disagree?
bio exams graded😳
but the idea of the specific words yes and no as single word answers didn't really exist
i just got a canvas notif saying “assignment bio final graded” but i’m too scared to look👍👍
Babe no you didn’t
How many points though
Can’t be worse than mine
We don’t even know how many frqs are done
I’m gonna cry
no clue why they didn't take the momentum and grade all 7 in one night doe 😔
You probably still got a better score than me though
Ugh
He didn’t even tell us what’s happening with that
apparently chem is in
Oh trust me I did
My chem exam is not graded
Oh
But the grades aren't posted 🤡🤣
OH CRAP HE JUST MADE AN ASSIGNMENT
Oh
That's just for tabulating purposes, that's just your exam 2 grade
-8ball will I die of a heart attack tonight
im an iphone 6s pleb so is that like a new feature
Oh
Except for the final 🤣🤡
Guys I’m getting so worried rn
I don’t even know what I currently have
WHY CANT HE USE CANVAS
He hates it
Also, every grade is posted for me EXCEPT for anything to do with the final
You should meet my SAGES professor, she doesn't put grades on Canvas at all
I just got my chem final exam grade!
omg
oh ya my bad
thats so sick
omg so jelly
u wish u were me
Guys our grades are gone
I got an A++++++ so suck it
My midterm grade isn’t showing up now
omg
guys i got a P in my pass or fail class
fuck yea
i know u failed that pass or fail class julia
These notifications are killing me
So fuck you
I'm on the phone with Ben now and I'm FREAKING out
Chemistry is now my highest grade because of the curve, but CS will probably surpass it once my final gets graded
i fucking go
Like final exam sections?
Ugh
and nothing else was graded
idk if hes gonna change it or smth
Sorry ill stop now
i’m curious tho, for like every exam he said that “grades were pretty consistent with previous years” but then his email was like “we curved 5% to match previous semesters where it wasn’t online”
I don’t even know bro
i’m sure it isn’t
i’m being harassed rn i don’t even know aidan
I’m still having heart attacks about bio
Brag all you want queen
You want the Hub? The Tube? Videos? Hamster?
Freaking out for nothing
I’m just hoping I didn’t mess up bio because of chem
I’ll be sad
I’d congratulate you but you were freaking out about nothing
I’m praying for those last 20 points
SAME THO
And yet you did it!!!
Though
I didn’t get an A on the final Lmaoo
I’d rather have loyalty than love cuz love really don’t mean jack
All they skits fye they legit cannot miss
Yesss I got 20 points on the bio exam
I just hope I didn’t jeopardize my bio grade because I focused so much on chem
I focused too much on bio but still big dumb
I still haven’t received 20 points in bio :’)
I want their Venmo’s
Damn go off make bank
Couldn't be me
i’m going back to work next week i can’t wait to make money🥲🥲
pri do u save or spend ur work money
Though
My boss keeps forgetting to pay me
So I haven’t been paid since august ahahaha
at least it’s gonna be a fat bag when u do get paid
oh aww
I mean she’s forgetting but the hours are racking up man
And I get it though
do u work thru the school year pri
Damn you killed that class
cuz we calculate 200% instead of 100% 🥰
case doesnt have + or -
Sometimes I wish we had +\-
Time to die
You can theoretically apply it to any class
But it doesn't let you get to a 4.33 idt
Is the final score already curved?
KILL MEEE
Oh my :(
Damn
If it makes you feel better I ruined my condition for this class
Bad
No you didn’t
Really really bad
I can’t afford to get a B for med school though
Saddeningly yes me too except for in history
somehow w/ rona, im gonna say they will want doctos
Ok ok ok. Relax. Think about it. You. Were. Sick. SO SICK
I guess
Because how else do you think I missed the psat threshold
I can’t say I got a B cause I was ill when I go for job interviews
no they dont lmao
They literally don’t pri
They actually don’t
It matters more for grad school
as long as you have the slip of paper that says, you did it
As long as you have a 3+ GPA, your GPA shouldn't prevent you from getting hired basically anywhere
Raunak wants to go to grad school though
ew, more school
Ok fair
ontop of school
Raunak one B won’t kill you
One B won’t kill you I got a b in calc
Hahahahahahahahahaha I’m very scared for bio right now
I'm sitting here w/ all C's *and a failure in java, but we dont talk about that*, and im still a student like u are
I mean not so much anymore lol
I don’t wanna take another chem class
B isn’t bad either
Ok think about this. Chem isn’t related to cs. It’s just a req bro. So at least you don’t have a B in Java where that class matters more
Fair
Still not related to cs though
Getting As in your math/CS/stats classes matters the most for graduate school
Yeah but life goes on after med school too
Fair
Think ab college
Med school is a whole other battle
A in math classes lmao
Should I lose all hope already? 💀
nahhh i just took too difficult of math classes too soon i think
Why are y’all awake? School is over. Go sleep
What are the difficult ones that should be avoided early?
You go sleep
i took math 305 my first semester and then linear my second and then analysis this semester
ended up dropping analysis
I'm a CS major who is planning to take around 8-9 math classes by the end of my career
linear wasn’t that bad but i kinda burned myself out of math tbh
Nah my mom is shouting at me to fix my sleeping schedule
Ok raunak just don’t fret
never heard of 'er
or dont
Raunak is tryna go to grad school though
I'm not going to take analysis unless I decide that I want to do either a PhD in either math/econ which is very unlikely
if case wants him for grad school
I’m taking Psychics and Math 122 next year 🤪🤪🤪🤪
Damn pri got big hopes and dreams
Not yet. Bio is still up in the air
Math 121
I am registered for math 223 and phys 122
tbh gpa isn’t gonna matter too much after you have like 2 internships that can vouch for you
imagine having a big brain, couldnt b me
Some of us want to go to grad school though instead of going straight into the workforce
lmao grad school might need it more
co-op u get paid tho
and money >>>>>>>>>>
Oh
Anjali still snagged a high A in chem though
a lot of ppl need experience before grad school too
I didn't get a 97 though
Still very solid
i wont need an internship lmao im a nursing student
clinicals are essencially internship tho
i guess
I don't know why since I didn't even read the textbook and I don't particularly care about chemistry
I grinded so hard for chem
And I let drew destroy me in office hours for 2 weeks straight
I didn't have to take chem
Problem is im international and like 80/90% companies don’t hire international interns
I think most of us wish we could have skipped it, so good for you
Someone marry me pls
drew has been marked as a 1/10 and has now left the premises
Hate to break it to you but someone has to like you in order for that to happen brother
Wow I can feel the romance
Guys my arm is SO SORE
What happen
I mean, I sat in bed for 6 hours straight then?
I’m not wrong though
I wish a guy said this
Sorry I doubted you
Oh
Rip
Guo doesn’t hold back
I didn't hold back on an 8 year old at local tournaments
I did not want to think ab that
Nun wrong wit giving the ole meat a tug every once in a while
Lmao then don’t
It was yugioh at my last locals

ya honestly i didnt really feel weird about it all
but like i didnt feel weird inherently
terms of service
terms of service
i still not sure wt that means
oh
The age difference is fine. Just think 23 and 18 might be kinda young to marry but I don’t know the deets so can’t really judge 🤷🏽‍♂️
terms of service
theyre fucking long
You didn’t read a god damn word of that shit
howdy even though you're *most likely* to read the tos I seriously doubt you do
is tru tho were not even in a nsfw channel
Honestly a lotta shit flies in general
SOMEONE EXPLAIN ME WHAT HAPPENED THAT COULDVE SHUT THIS DOWN RN please and thanks
`Terms of service, didnt read`
Oh
zacks on the money
yk if you don't read it it doesn't exist
Someone marry me and promptly divorce
if alberto said he was dating his fiance when he was 19 and she was still undersage
I didn't read what my chem grades were so I can't fail it
I need that green card
you can mark urself as independent on fafsa w/ out marrige, you just have to formally cut urself off from parents
Also, I don’t think I can marry before 21 😔
do you need us to arrange you a marraige?
I think I can get married but I have no one to marry because I’m single forever❤️
It’s to end child marriage in India
*hint, its probs not working*
err.. cuz she was 28
actually we broke up the day i was going to
Oh my :(
isnt that a beer
no it doesn't, we will come
i wasnt gonna go to college at the time
Ah another phrase we need to teach you
the cities are so clean in japan
and she happened to be moving to kyoto to teach english after
Why aren’t my stories like this
and i happened to have a job there
Wtf
Wtf
She ain’t lie
Alberto this question wasn't directed to me, but that shit sounds dangerous if you're in the US 😂
You don’t see brown people shooting up schools 🤐
yh dont go in the us
hostels and hospitality arent a thing in this country so
Damn imagine having low melanin levels
Must suck
Couldn’t be me
Your fiancé doesn’t need to know
Who the train getting ran on Raunak
Ugh
Too tired to explain just google
those arent self exclusive
RAUNAK WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BECOME BODHISATTVAS TOGETHER
If you ever catch me talking like this to try and get a girl just fucking put me down like an old dying dog
That is an existence of hell I pray I’m never down bad enough to do
Nope
cause baby i got bad blood
damn
Yo wtf
Sorry but I can’t marry you Zhanda
Ok just stay single I guess
Eminem a mumble rapper cry about it
Wow what kind of toxic rellationship is this i can't even have my own opinions :/

Raunak said they be goalies in soccer that don’t mean you can’t score still 😈😈😈😈
dont judge me everyone
this orange smells real good, but is a pain to peel
Meek never dropped The GOAT
Alberto, I really don’t mean to be mean, but you move really fast. Not saying it’s a bad thing. Just an observation
Bro I don’t even know what I wanna eat most nights n this man know a girl the one after a day

what happened?
Sonya if you hurt Alberto I will COME FOR YOU
^^without consent

Pulling up all black Gucci, Balaclava n a Drako to hit a lick on girl if she hurt Alberto
i want kids so badddd
I feel bad for my parents for spending money on me
Ugh
and sad
Sad!
dont you think they wanted to?
They don’t mind, but I just feel guilty if they spend money on me for stuff not related to my absolute needs
lol i think i only want 3
also ouch.
She didn’t give me a birthday present 😔
Ummm for secret Santa? Yeah. I never really had a friend like that
I do have friends from hs but I don’t know I feel distanced from them
you spend so many hours on this useless discord app
Mag doesn’t mess around
my math class has a discord server lmfao
cuz i wasnt religious enuf
math 304
I'd rather have loyalty than love
Cuz love really don't mean jack 
See love is just a feeling
You can love somebody and still stab them in the back 
It don't take much to love
You can love somebody just by being attached 
See loyalty is a action
You can love or hate me and still have my back
that class so bad it deserves cheating tbh
just lurking tho
Oh crap
didn't the scores come out
Same though
No not yet
this is like 4th time today. you need a spa
wtf spotify can do this

I’m glad Ted Bundy wasn’t alive today

He’d put up 100 kills easily with how stupid society is today
Sorry Albert
@spartan010 I’m sorry on Zhanda’s behalf
corpse is all like choke me like you hate me
oh
@spartan010 sorry 😦 i think you're chinese so let a brother slip
If I ever get into someone’s car and they playing Corpse I’m walking to wherever I need to go
like why do u want to be a ded body
i want to
Corpse called himself that because he used to read like scary deep web stories
"scary web storys"
He’s been making horrifyingly bad music for a while now
and if thats scary
im so sorry for u
@chandachan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5d4SJv2d6M pretty bad

Girls be simping over his voice when it literally causes him physical and emotional pain everyday but OMG voice is so deep 😍😍😍
Don’t have to imagine it
Except Polo 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Oh
OH
oh no
no wrong answer or marks
I can’t man I may have jeopardized my bio grade just for chem
He didn’t leave me a comment
hey yknow the future that doesnt exist now going away isnt the end of the present
I studied so hard for chem that I didn’t focus so much on bio so
It’s almost 2 am I’d wake someone up
You need some bud
Can’t take your life seriously if you don’t have one
Wouldn’t you be sad?
It’s gone
Y’all need to sleep
if it doesnt go down im more shocked
yes but we are of the different philosophy in that i bet you think being sad is something to avoid and that its bad
School is over
or ur gonna miss out on like half of life
Fair
Since I got him p much yeah
^_^ c you still got stuff to celebrate too
my midterm grade in baders class was an f
and it was an f 2 weeks before finals too
DAMN
cuz he felt bad
Well I didn’t get 100 lol
I’m so scared I didn’t even get the minimum score for bio though
r u passing java tho?
Which is REALLY bad
so worst case
it doesnt show up on ur transcript and u j retake the class
EVERYSINGLE CLASS
I learned omega sm everytime he didnt lecture
oh
aw 😦
im used to it
but still
dont place too much importance on something that doesnt and might not exist
Dec 4th was the last day to drop
I am v close to an A in 145 but I don’t think I’ll pull it out
idk him
Dude I went from a really low B almost C to an A
in anyclass, java is the only confim fail
Oh without curve I barely got an A
unlikely, but until government funding money dissapears next yr im still here
You don’t know who Ted Bundy is???
do you think your gonna have to go thru all the probation stuffs?
dunno
if funding is cut, im out of here
im poor pri
Oh what they can’t do that to you
they can do whatever they want
its their school
Why would funding go down though
but i thought it didnt apply to government merit?
government is need

*how did u know i was awake* :zoomeyes:
@kaori_flute sorry it appears on tag
I want to get out of bed but I cannot
I want to go eat but there is a doggo stuck between my legs
Awwww
I woke up to snow and it abruptyl stopped
I c you damn Christmas elves
6 inches an hour god damn
Same, I don’t think it snowed as hard for us but I have huge almost floor to ceiling windows in my room and the view outside is so pretty
My mom is literally full-on trying to convince me to stay home
And that I’ll hate it there
Living alone and stuff
well frankly is anyone actually doing anything except sitting in their dorms in the spring?
everyone has to stay alone at some point
I can’t even get in contact with my dad for 20 more minutes UGHHHH
Because I think he’d want me to go
honestly I'm not willing to spend so much money and like $17 per meal for no benefit
He felt really bad for me when I didn’t get housing
Like quality of life won’t be great
sigh
I wish the vaccine came out earlier :(
i wish that guy didnt eat the bat
first off wasn't it a pangolin?
I hope they don’t initiate the shelter in place
i cant stay at home any longer
I just can’t
I need a fucking change of environment
My mom is just afraid that half of her nest will be empty when I’m gone
So she’ll be even more lonely🥺
Attachments are hard to break from but necessary
She’s a neat freak and doesn’t like so much maintainence
I don’t know
sad
He felt really bad when I couldn’t go this year
So he wants me to have the same experience
same with me. my mom  still isnt convinced that i should to to campus
I don’t blame moms tho
Plus it’s NEVER quiet when my sister is home
Or worse
When my WHOLE family’s home
my mom really carried me in her womb for 9 months that's wild
I guess that I'm lucky then since my home environment is very conducive to studying
Yeah mine isn’t all the time
I feel blessed when it’s quiet
I just stay in my quiet room all day and I easily focus on my work as a result
Just not good for studying
My dad travels for work
my house is never quiet with the two devil dogs I have
The time zone issue is too bad
Can’t even join clubs wtf
I mean even on campus too it’s a but hard
i cant get involved
I wanted to join hackCWRU
Wtf
omg
dhnanjay we need to be on campus. this shit is annoying
I don’t know about me
I NEED TO SEE PEOPLE
But I still need to see people
I’m just tryna not relive k-12 man I WANT FRIENDS
The last HackCWRU meeting I went to was interesting; it was a lecture about how to calculate factorials in Python without using recursion
I’m jealous now
i wish i could attend
Apparently, you can use lambda functions instead
Actually I did that in math club so jokes on you
math club?
He’s in math club and he showed it
So he gave the same presentation at the math club?
wth is the math club?
Math club smh
I wanted to go to the math club this semester but I was always busy on Fridays, unfortunately
I joined a club, and then they never did anything
Didn’t attend a few
And some didn’t do anything
That presentation alone made me want to take PLC
Also bad stuff can happen
bruh i dont drink so i wont be able to join most of them
OH
I read your text wrong
nothing...
The perks of having a sister at Case was that she told me what frats were good and which were bad
Really narrowed down the options
Beta is dope. They suck at among us tho
I will gladly be anti-social if it means I won’t get alcohol poisoning
i sent the wrong gif
i dont
Apparently you since you sent that gif
I've never watched any anime
That puts you in the wrong
so youre also wrong then?
Raunak don’t lie
you dont?
He said I’m not committed yet so
ahhhh damn nice!!
i abt died when i saw my chem grade come back lol - i was panicking so hard so i get the feels
yeahhhhh i feel that
Yep :( I’m gonna cry
i actually didn't take Bio 214 this past sem, is it worse than chem? @anjalir519 @sprinkles2108
And I spent wayyyyy more time studying in bio than in chem
Because the content was a) dense and b) he makes his exams unnecessarily hard and wack
i heard u have to do test appeals and shit for points back, how bad are the questions then 💀
And the TA’s don’t have mercy
oh lord
I hope so too, I just need my parents to let me go
My mom is trying to convince me that it won’t be worth it
I need to gtfo
Yeah I get that stuck feeling
Ugh
I want friends
Day in day out like the same room it’s so tiring I need to go places
I want to GO to college
Sadly it's p empty even on campus
Yes I saw. It was sad :(
Did you guys get snow tho?
I mean yeah I’m definitely going to other places to study but here I don’t even have the option to do that
dude u won't, i promise lol @sprinkles2108
I mean well you know ppl on campus alrdy don't you?
I NEED A QUIET PLACE TO STUDY
ahhhhhh yeah i feel that @anjalir519
Then you probably won't regret it
And it’s also lonely? It’s weird having friends but also not really having friends cz ive never met any of them
School is my priority
I didn’t socialize
So I focused on school
honestly i'm like that too- but even my studying sometimes was with other ppl @sprinkles2108
Ah.. my entire middle school and hs school
Yeah that’s fair
u can invite ppl to study with u at the library - tha's what i do
Yeah that’s fair
I prefer studying with other people
It's usually super distracting for me but it helps not feel lonely which is usually a net positive for productivity xD
It keeps me more focused and I felt so drifty this last semester and unmotivated
I mean you gotta find people that don’t devolve into talking lol
I feel like I made the wrong study friend s
Because I need silence
I haven’t been there
i go there all the time to study
Couldn’t be me
My mom wants me to get the vaccine and go next fall :((((
That’s still a year to go :(
how there's an orange-ish building there with a revolving door
you go in that and go up the stairs away from the security guard
I’ll be stuck in my dorm yes but ughhhhh
Being at home isn’t great either
only thing is that it closes early so u can't stay till like 8 pm
The law school library?
I don’t trust being at the library at night so
@lookingforthegoldenlight someone thought Priyanka wasn’t my name on here lol
i just realized i paid $100 for a textbook i didnt use a single time
Which class?
naw our sages class is tight
My behavioral economics class didn't use a textbook either
I think we were supposed to do readings
But I took the class in HS so
The professor said that we could read a graduate-level book but it was optional and everything on the exams was just from the lectures
What happened with the women's suffrage book?
Nope
Even though CWRU told us that our SAGES professors would talk about it
Mine mentioned it once and then never said a word about it again
if it isnt required, its highly unlikely im doing it
not required, not extra credit = don't do it
depends on the mood i guess
That’s jenin’s thing you can’t say that
Go off I guess
y u bored?
idk
o i meant it like y r u bored
-8ball can you forgive me for insulting you for the past 2 months
fair enough
I won’t say what it’s about
i feel like ive heard of it
I also think that "Burning" is one of the best movies that I've seen and it's on Netflix but a lot of people think it's too slow and boring
It seems like most people here recommend Nightcrawler
orrrr meg u could talk to me cause i’m bored 🥺
meg, u cant blame her, it must b hard to keep bouncing between grindr and discord
i want to do something but
Yes but I had to do some other things so I couldn't make much progress
6th grade vibes though
you didnt
But wasn’t active lately
Exactly how sad were you
I don't want to give my data to Facebook
I don’t use Facebook regularly
Facebook aint even that bad guus
I actually started watching but thought it got too slow and boring
I don’t even know what that is but ok
Maybe I do and I forgot
I just didn't say anything before
@mag3is he doesnt
idk
theres other people in your situation tho lol
That awkward and terrible moment
But discover 4 /6 of the solutions are wrong
And you miss your plane cuz you had to email him all night
I’ve had all my finals not like most of my classes haven’t actually reported grades yet
I still only have 3 classes with grades on SIS
Chemistry is not on SIS even though I know my grade and Java hasn't been graded yet
I can’t use it
“Oh you’re a CS major? Can you fix my iPad?”
oh sorry u don't undrstand weeb language
Howdy how to right click on your phone?
oh lala?
cuz sarah used to for the pumpkin
What’s that even supposed to be?
i don't :AngrySmoosh:
havent payed for it once
maybe but i have nitro and u dont
damn roman next level simp :eyes2:
@sonya5493 back off Alberto is mine
XD idk if shell get that ping haha but I figured since y'all wanted to meet her
Don't be jealous :P
Oof you right she likely won’t
He can’t compete dw
Guys I got my last grade back!! ^_^
What happened?
I’m still waiting on bio🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I passed w a 90.06
OMG
DONT SEARCH SCRE
Holy fuck I just searched it
Couldn’t be me
I dunno either man
I’m so scared FACK
Connamacher is also still prolly grading too
"I have 15 minutes to finish, I'm going to assign everyone an B by default, and A if I think they deserved one", but like w.o tallying anything cuz he took too long to grade
Cause you won’t be in campus
I’m beyond scared man🥲🥲🥲
He allowed you to submit missing work?
Dude he didn’t give a single crap about whether your work was late or not
He prolly got last minute plows
But he made the class as such that your couldn’t move on to the next topic until you finished the previous one
I don’t know if they’ll be lenient though lol
All of math Euler
Ik math majors who don't know the king of maths
Euler still today makes everyone in anything look incompetent at everything
There’s like a 70% chance Euler was a time traveller that went back and got everything in math named after him
RIP the professor of math that died on Wednesday
The Daily sent me an email with the headline that Professor Elizabeth Meckes died, it's the first email I remember seeing about a professor dying
In a few weeks?
It also means you probably lost the game
0 for 30 is worse than 0 for 9 in a multi-armed bandit problem because it shows a greater record of failure
shut the fuck up @toomanyzs
@howdy_. you buffoon, we dont have a bots channel
yall ever had grades on exams go to 3 decimal points
Meg the difference between 59.001 and 59.002 doesn’t matter if you fail anyways
Don't think med schools care unfortunately
Is that really an accomplishment
stalin has the highest k/d, you cant hope to beat that
we can never kno
Isn't Skyrim still playable even if there are a lot of bugs? Cyberpunk had to be pulled from the PS Store because it's unplayable
Last game that was removed from online stores was Arkham Knight on PC and that was also unplayable for a while
discord.py is pretty clean from what I've heard
The discord bot needs improvement but the scraper is ok
fair, fair
(though im gonna be real a great deal of them aren't that accurate)
Oh yes that wouldn't *particularly hard*
I'd have to update the scraper tho since that's not being scraped atm
Rn I'm trying to get the number of ratings, would take again percentage and department
But atm I'm trying to implement searching for multiple professors
Ahh i see, that'll be pretty sick
Also idk why I’m awake rn
isnt it like 9 am there
normal time to be awake ain't it?
Cold
Too cold
also can't help but notice the air quality
air quality on my phone isn't even at the top of my screen like yours is
~~yet~~
im sleepy but don't wanna sleep
I have work and I should be but I’m not
I wanna sleep but I’m not sleepy
i also have work tomorrow so f
Don’t hate it
Just lay perfectly still for 10 minutes
sorry i only have dollars and not rupees
Mam I lay perfectly still the entire day
Fair enough
YALL DONT EVEN KNOW
IT FEELS GREAT TO DO NOTHING
I did nothing even when the semester was going on
that was me at some points too then my grades started crying for help
oml you don't know all those insane indian money transfer websites that constantly advertise themselves
THEY DONT AIR THEIR ADS IN INDIA
I’m an ohioan and I have never seen such ads
I have never felt something more true
ARENT we all
In a good way or bad?
Yea the pic was taken a while back
But I don’t think I look too old from that pic
I be short
When COVID goes away we can all hangout in my "sex dungeon room"
We do be short
there’s so many of us that we need to be smaller to accommodate everyone
There’s only so much land
it's really not that weird
Imagine meeting someone at the college you go to
Rip in the chat for priyanka
won't hurt cuz im numb to the pain
Why do I just never receive this information
Money so tall Yao.ming
Nothing
“Nothing”
Can’t believe it wasn’t anything fun smh
i wont be offended
ive endured worse remarks im sure
Don’t tell her Anjali
Yikes I’m keeping my mouth shut on this one sorry pri
was it really that bad?
i mean since groupme logs who joins and leave it would seem pretty random...
They never said that
tho idk if i'll experience that 😳
By fun 

You mean fucking awful
Only time this shit finna be worth it is when we chasing bags on blood
I enjoyed the math problems
Oh my gosh💀💀
It's not just premeds, I'm trying to self-study Calculus 3 right now 🤡
I work hard not because I enjoy it but because of the fear of a bad GPA
Although the report sucked ass to write tho
I didn’t know it meant I got a room
I didn’t fully read it
I still need to talk to my parents
Shit I only have a day to decide
I don’t know if it’s worth it though
I really don’t know if I should go
But sometimes my sister drives me nuts, I’ve been home for 9 months now, and I want a little more social interaction
He doesn’t wanna come lol
And tbh I don’t think I should either
Ok don’t come
I guess I’ll suffer for another semester
Since campus won’t be any better
Lolol didn't help his case that he was blind for most of his life
Gauss was p accomplished, but no where near as prolific. We haven't even finished archiving Euler he wrote on avg 800 published pages per year of his life. Gauss had 5-6 great manuscripts
Ramanujan was incredibly smart but sadly he only really got a couple years to do anything b4 dying of I think tb so
True but that means that there’s a greater risk of being sent home in the middle of the semester which I don’t need
Yeah, so I don’t think I’m gonna come :(
But Gauss wasnt solely restricted to mathematics
the downside of everything being online, I cant burn everything at the end of the semester
cuz its all 0 n 1s
Set fire to computer :Stonks:
which would b a shame
Never played a Nintendo game 😎
Ehhh Einstein didn't use much of his work and for the most part they were contemporaries. I doubt they met
Tbh idet Einstein Cld understand his work
But I don't buy into it
I’m sorry 😔😔
I only play RPG/strategy/simulation games and almost nothing else
He would be so disappointed
I still haven't been able to play the newest one
I'm trying to decide whether I should play MGSV or RDR2 next
Dang I haven’t had pancakes in a WHILE
I’ve been doing the algebra problems tho 😇
HERE I AM TRYING TO NOT EAT TOO MUCH
Even though I had bibibop for lunch
Couldn’t be me
Okay but you got an A in his class so stop complaining
I can feel myself fattening
You didn’t have to follow the restrictions
We aren’t serious
Chris Butler taught my high school math teacher
Your high school math teacher is a CWRU alum?
YOURE RIGHT NOPE IM TOTALLY SERIOUS
I’m sorry
I’m not taking his class next sem tho
Chris Butler said that the guy who taught him Calculus 3 is still a professor at CWRU 👀
I can’t deal with the online shit anymore
Y’all should’ve taken Calc 2
We aren’t as smart as you
You would’ve gotten a semester’s break of math if you wanted to
I retook Calc 2 smh so I ain’t smort either
Either
Neuro majors have to take up to Calc 2 and then stat 312 for math
Oh gross
My major requires MATH 121, 122, 223, 201/307, 304, and then 380 satisfies stats requirements and that's just the minimum
Jesus Christ I can’t
I could literally never y’all are insane
^^ I love math but I’m dumb
We have a lot of math req
you better let her study if she wants raunak
Raunak I stg if you hurt her anjali and I will bonk you
I want living and dead
damn it's 4 am over there what are you doing up
oh no
No evidence that it increases severity or mortality tho luckily
Although seems like it's more of a Europe problem atm
I remember doing it but I didn't really pay attention
In hindsight I really should've
I sincerely thought they gave the times for each sages class when we picked prefs
Nope they didn’t
It wasn’t bad because we didn’t have to talk in our sages
for what tho
are u trying to make an autoclicker
Nahhh I was just trying to find the word
bad idea, we hate it here
As a nursing major I also hate it here lol
The grass is always greener but also never
we need some green grass
Isn't nursing here good?
But it’s hard
Nope
Don’t need that extra
Work
i looked if there was something for major, but im not doing a class to take class, thats hell
Yea they ofc didn’t put any nursing classes up so there was no point
and I got the classes I wanted for normal term
Oh turns out the person who sent the email typoed? Fucked up? And switched the dates even tho on SIS it was how I wanted
I mean since I can enroll in classes earlier I was fully prepared to fuck over another student
I do what I need to do :glock:
will there be a time where your priority screws you tho, like w/ grad students, would u get stuck w/ seniors still
Yea I think senior year I wouldn’t be able to enroll earlier
By then I wouldn’t really need it, hopefully I would just be doing the bare minimum
Do all the work now to do nothing my last 2 years🤞
It’s what I did highschool and I lived my best life senior year doing nearly nothing
fair enough, by senior year i was wearing pjs during stagecraft, so my effort to care was out the window
Not this year tho 😔
last year it was a pot we took from outside
the present drop off aint half bad of an idea tho, aslong as everyones following regulations n stuff
Yea it’s never longer than 2 minutes
I think zoom is going to perm stuck having a second meaning after this lol
A lot of what we have in America isn’t even the original one
hopefully it dont
We aren’t technically hospital workers
But we also work in them sometimes
i think case is gonna start w/ profs that are in most need b4 students tho
well when you become a full on nurse, you wont even need to doctor :P
Ew med school
I barely have the money for normal college
I need phone case suggestions
you have iphone or android
iPhone
My only real requirement is that I need to be able to fit my driver’s license under the case, so if it fits too tight that’s an L
like damn
How much protection does one need for it to be that expensive??
so they arent mass producing it
I don’t think I drop my phone thaaat much
what iphone version u got?
I'm still using an S8
ever want a dry and wet phone at same time lol
Oh gosh
looks like a bunch of broken glass
Like it’s already been broken lol
but worse
Ugh the semester just ended but the Thinking never stops
To continue the conversation from #memes😂  , my earliest class next semester is 9:30 Eastern so no more waking up at 7:00 for me 😎
I just walked outside for the first time in weeks and I'm soooo outta shape
walking takes work
There were some weeks during the semester when I got almost no exercise because of my workload
I was gonna say it’s too cold to do that then realized it’s 42 lol
Yeah it's tooo cold
I also thought this and now I feel dumb
pools during rona seem v sus
I didn’t swim in hs but gosh I miss it so much
Anyone else hate the outdoors?
I prefer to stay inside
Not tryin to die ~~before~~ if I become a doctor
you wont die
I didn’t get it at first lol
I know it's brutal, but didn't you get a 4 GPA this semester?
I don't even know what I want to do
I don't get the joke
Oh
I mean if I wasn't doing pre med and just majoring BA in comp sci that might actually be possible
Hmm I mean I didn't make it up, I just heard it from somewhere
With the degrees I’m pursuing I can’t graduate in 3 years
I wish
What’s wrong with a BS anyway? Research req?
Yeah fair
Idk but if I'm doing a double major Imma have a hard time with BS
But neuro isn’t too loaded actually
Yeah I've looked into it but idk
I’m double majoring with a BA in psych soooo💀💀💀
Yeah fair cs is not
Well idk if it's easy but CS doesn't that much overlap
Well that’s because you want to go to grad school
Some of them don't require a departmental seminar
It’s hard to make a conclusion then
There are a few premeds in my SAGES and they were about to lose it
In the end it wasn't even close, you earned solid As in all of your classes. I was also worried that I would get like a 3.2 this semester but my lowest grade turned out to be 92%
I was constructing worse case scenarios where I got Bs in everything except chem
Even after the chem final I was trying to convince myself that I probably got a 60 percent on it 🤡
I knew I didn’t do bad on chem but I was afraid I was gonna fall just short of an A
Bio was scaring me. I thought I’d lose my A
But I guess the TA’s were lenient
A lot of us always want to underestimate ourselves by saying things like "What if I get a D on the final even though I got Bs or As on the previous tests?"
And I really thought I got a worse grade than that since the free responses were wack
Possibly, I would need to do 16 credits a semester for that
Cwru school of medicine doesn’t have letter grades at all though. They have their own weird grading system
Med schools are very competitive so this is supposed to help
But med school is veryyyyy hard so
Fair
But if you barely graduated med school then wouldn't you have trouble getting a residency?
Yeah ig pass/no pass isn't the solution, but it would really help if I didn't have to worry about my GPA
It would help, but then people getting C’s in all their pre med classes are at the same level as nearly straight-A students which isn’t completely fair
Ugh this is too complicated
Ugh
Yeah fair
What hours? Volunteer hours for med school?
A: Humongous brain
B: No offense but I don't consider Econ to be that hard of a major, correct me if I'm wrong
C: That's still not a 4.0 lol
Honestly that'd be so frustrating tho
CCEL hours are very broad
It's not just volunteering, e.g. working at the polls was considered hours
And it's like 20 hours this year which is ridiculous
Oh
I just checked, the registration for CCEL Scholars are closed until August 🤡
I wasn't initially interested in CCEL but then I think one of my orientation leaders brought it up
I didn't really learn anything very useful in orientation
Looks like someone else is also developing a Discord bot 👀
seems more like a spam macro
Something is wrong, my computer is saying out loud what you are saying @chandachan
nothing is wrong, its a feature of discord
It's literally just Zhanda tho
i can though
Oh
does this work
OMG I fixed my sleeping schedule
raunak needs his bueaty sleep
time to suck up to AA even more
*Asians leave the chat*
*almost like discrimination bad or something huh*
Sarah sad cause her server is dying
Scared waiting for admissions decisions
Because I would feel bad leaving lol
Sarah u starting a war
i wish ron ... i wish
I want it :sadcat:
This server isn’t thatttt dead
It's not dead but there are maybe 2 or 3 dozen people regularly talking which isn't that many
Missed the fun bus then rip
I don’t talk as much because there’s not much to talk about now
Are the 2021-2023 servers dead?
2023 is kinda dead yeah
they wont
We don’t need to be there lol
Not even the 2024 people want to stay on the 2024 server 🤡 I don't know why some of us moved to the 2025 one instead
i still cast heavy doubt on the rfid implant
Granted I don't have one
rip
Why would u need an implant of that
you dont rlly
idk this guy on 2025 said he had one of those chips in his hand
and he wanted to know if he could program it to open his dorm
Won’t he be like, 16 or something
I don't think you can because the keys are secured so you can't access the info on them
the keys arent secured well tho
Hence why I can't emulate NFC-based hotel room keys with my phone
but you didnt hear that from me
its not that bad
daven kinda got the answers tho
It's not much different than microchipping a pet, except it's a programmable NFC tag that can be used to say, unlock a house by tapping your hand against a smart lock
Their score isn’t even low by case standards
i feel slight toxicity from that server
These kids though
I’ve just been eating popcorn waiting for someone to post something really messed up in the nsfw channel that really shouldn’t exist
Can you fuck off?
realized it’s called cake
I still have some unfrosted cupcakes
But I didn’t frost all of them
i want cupcakes :nkolost:
Are you trying to make a discord bot?
nah idek what a computer is
no im tryna unfuck someone else's code
but i dont know js
Then don’t help them lol
If it’s logic stuff I might be able to help
Your opinion literally doesn’t matter
that shit SLAPPED
That comeback was awful ngl
WHO HERE HAS AN IPHONE
i would if it wasn’t bedtime
I’m v sleepy too
Or another day when more iPhone users are available
I cancelled myself rip
zhanda, have you heard of the theory tho
Worst moment of my life was getting a smarties flurry in London
I’m so sleepy
but those aint smarties
Cadbury though🥰👀
I wanted that chalky sugary goodness
no bad
Ohhhh I wish they did
I don’t
Seems like a setup for something illegal
But I do need that chalky goodness
We don’t have smarties here
it could be that the smarties that we had are bad
My mom probably hasn’t had smarties in over a decade, so she probably wouldn’t know either
I miss Halloween
It hasn’t even snowed enough to feel like winter
Let alone Christmas
it's raining here
3 weeks ago was dope tho
i just want a white christmas, but globabl warming just keeps saying nou
apparently this js is a mess so bug=not fixed
oh i dont understnad the code either
I cant help y'all fix it
basically when you download the svg it doesn't end in .svg which is annoying so you have to do it manually
thats annoying
I was like "this can't be that hard to fix." But then I realized I also dont know js so
why would u need desmos to b an svg
if i want to laser engrave desmos...
that was how i made math sheep
but tbh grease monkey is a super cool firefox extention, I'm sure it could be used for so much more useful shit
math sheep b useful
I'll mail you math sheep
do they still accept packages when we are off campus
idk I'm ready to dox
take away their breathing perms?
Hi sorry my connection got lost. Will join for the next game.
oh we're doing jackbox rn but you can hop in
@kaori_flute why are you still awake?
Time zone diff do be killing
Is not sleeping basically like waking up really early for the next next day
Jenin what do you even do so early?
I used to sleep late cause of the time diff
I simply to not have the strength to stay up past 3 am unless I either a) drank coffee or b) took a nap earlier in the day
I don't understand why so many people here are awake at 5 AM
Couldn't be me
and they want it to be a public server?
What happened?
They need Jesus that’s all
you forgot clarke tower, its a nightmare
@raunakwastaken YOURE WRONG
they really are not
isnt
I'm not on campus so I don't have a clue
AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE ADDRESSED BY DR.
i was supposed to live there :')
fair, but quality of life is better at home
i heard cutler isn't good
haven't lived in any other buildings so I have no frame of comparison
but this time i didn't check 🤡
i really hope he doesn't care that much
or that i don't get bashed
Ohhh rip
excuse me while i go cry
ugh
And bader said he didn’t care really
I still called him Professor Butler 🤡
He doesn’t care in the slightest
In that case he probably doesn’t care
a hs school student sending a letter to their teacher
anyone wants to watch?
Oo what’s the short?
dog and cat
The moment when I got the email from Scott Cowen telling me that January classes would be available, I knew I had to take one. I don't know why but I like taking classes just for the sake of taking classes
does anyone know if you need a rec letter to become an OL
i don't think so
i didn't realize apps opened up
They need Jesus
they need jesus allah, moses,
they need me
and i don't plan on being there
its not supposed to be good
its supposed to set u up for the year
I don't have people skills so
There isn't a calc 5 but I do plan to eventually take Calc 4 (Diff Eq)
Also I don't know what to do on campus either
David Chen: How I Find my Motivation to Study Calc III During the Winter Among Other Things
How did I never know that
@chandachan Are you still planning to take the January Session Calculus III? Won't that be very difficult?
No there hasn't been an email sent out
Damn that makes me even more motivated
david never stay unmotivated because you're motivating me so if you're no longer motivated i won't be motivated, so keep being mmotivated because that's really motivating me
Bruh Java needs to hurry up
I need to request overloading on credits and I can't if I don't have all my grades
Even though I'm no longer trying to overload
Yo don't we have the same navigator
Just watch me get a B in Calculus III because I'll stupidly take it in a 3 week session and then kill any hopes of getting into a half decent graduate program 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
one B won't ruin your chances i promise you
getting a 4.0 here is really hard
If I get a B in Calculus III then it'll be entirely because I took it in 3 weeks and I'll feel like an idiot
and plus i don't need calc 3 at all
i got so bored i logged into aleks and realized i forgot chem
Michael you look like the baby from ice age sorry it's a compliment
When I originally couldn't get into the January Calculus III I was frustrated. The moment that I registered for it I suddenly felt the fear of underperforming given the shortness of the session. The grass is always greener on the other side, I guess.
That's why I chose not to sign up for STAT 312. I mean, it was already filled up but before then I myself decided against it since I heard it was hard
I'm trying to convince myself that since I'm doing a lot of studying before Christmas that it's really like five weeks instead of three 🥲 🤡
since you have the means and the courage it wouldn't hurt to try. you know yourself best lol
I'm finding the differentiation aspect of multivariable functions to be quite doable (gradients, partial derivatives, directional derivatives) but I'm worried that I'm going to hit a wall when I get to multiple integration
How do you know what that is if you haven't studied it yet? 👀 Are you already preparing?
I registered for the January Calculus III class
So you’re not taking the test anymore?
No, since the test is on the 6th and the class starts on the 8th
I'm still preparing though
Because starting from scratch and doing Calc 3 in 3 weeks is GPA suicide
Didn’t you say you didn’t get into the class
Originally, but I got a spot in it after someone dropped it
Oh
@nobelium19 idk why but I’m up
Oh
but idk if chem counts
Don't understate your future achievements; even if there's a lot of overlap, if you satisfied the requirements, you EARNED it
thanks, i'm trying to find a lot of overlap with neuro and psych, and i can't find some of the overlapping courses in SIS from previous semesters
idek if some of them are offered anymore
SAGES throws a wrench into some of my plans for a double major
dont 4get pe
fml
just dont be a double major
why do we have to do pe omg
cuz i want to
When I see that @nobelium19 liked a message says that double majoring is a bad idea 👀
he's double-majoring himself tho
idk but psych is 30 so
Nobel is triple majoring in neuroscience, ba CS, and BS spplied math
Sigh
HA I wish
DO IT WE CAN DIE TOGETHER
CS BS would kill me
Tbh I don't have everything planned out tho
im trying to rn and its rough
@_frostyyyyy_ do you want to major in gender studies like me?
i hate biology
when do you parents wake uip ?
aren't you a bio major...?
thomas is pre med and bmke though
and he didn't die
I've heard that most BME premeds realize that the engineering curriculum destroys their GPA and stop trying to be premeds
im way too dumb for bme holy crap
@everyone is big brain except me
The problem is that it takes just a few Bs to really hurt your chances at med school
really ?
Even if you go to a med school like university of houston
as an indian i feel your pain
2 overall isn't bad but i don't want a single B
what class
I would guess Linear Algebra
She just said “2 Bs are bad” and “I’m smol brain”.
i said not bad
I CANT
Nope, I replaced Calculus III during the main part of the semester with Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus
my dad said linear algebra was the one of the roughest classes he took in college
I heard that Intermediate Micro isn't too bad, here's the rating
The linear algebra I took was not too bad, but it wasn't the proof-based class
If I get a B in Calculus III then I'm going to get ready for a truly horrible semester 🤡
then take things slow.
Because I want to challenge myself and prove to grad school admissions committees that I would be a good addition
fair
idk anything about grad school admissions lol
i only know med school admissions and that too a very small amount so cut me some slack
Ah, I guess that rule is fair then
and she's a genius and still thinks cmu is really hard
Wrong
i want to die old and happy so i want to make the most of my life
raunak is in india tho
Bruh y’all need to chill
I don’t think I’ve even been serious about a joke but whatever
Problem is that a lot of people aren't joking about that type of thing
Question: if I get to the last day of class in Calculus III and I think I won't get an A, should I just drop it via freshman forgiveness?
I don’t think so
if it won't show up on your transcript then yeah
grad schools won't know you took the course in 3 weeks. just saying
unless you want to accept it
I should stop worrying so much 🤡 and actually study to ensure I get an A
yes! work toward your goal. manifest it.
Breaking Bad
i have never seen that show
MATH BETA MATH
ITS PRONOUNCED MATH
My j term class is about happiness.
still haven't gotten into med school so
really ?
apparently
i feel the urge to start prepping for the mcat now since i regret waiting til junior year of hs to study for the ACT and SAT
is that for grad school?
im contemplating prepping for mcat starting now LOLLLLLLLL 🤡
Isn't basically all the premed courses a form of preparation for MCAT?
sorry that its the only way some of us will be able to make better money 😭
meg is going to become a nurse practitioner and work at university hospitals
adam spitting them bars last night 👀
If anyone wants support for not going to grad school and feeling excluded HMU
I don't plan on going to grad school
lmao i considered med school for a while last year when rethinking nursing lmfao
i want to do a crna program tho
I’ve concluded that the longer the acronym is to describe your job, the smarter you are.
im like what the fuck is that
I will never forgive him
oh shit the groupme was going nuts
that happened with my ochem class bc the grades were curved but not recognized by sis
and someone said 'I HOPE YOU HAD THE WORST FJUCKING BIRTHAY COVAULT'
i think it wouldve been in the students favor tho like getting assigned a lower grade but actually getting a higher one
Groupme is just there to make me feel bad for not studying 25 hours a day
our nursing groupme is awful. they be worrying about stuff on like friday nights im like please go outside
and she took his class?
Glennis was in my SAGES class
She didn't talk that much so I don't know
she was doing a study abroad in england
I'm worrying about stuff even though it's the winter break
Anyone here not studying rn??
Do you need validation?
not me even tho i tried to
ive been doing jack shit ever since finals ended and i could not be more satisfied
warzone bad zone
Y’all don’t know?
i've never played fortnite i'm not even lying
didn't find it addicting
THAT WAS MIDDLE SCHOOL
Prove me wrong
damn they already made a run 4 ?
oh 🤡
that shit didn't teach any math
Oh
will kill me
Well not yet
Fucc it hates me
Oh
Plz fix
and no offense I don't think RMP likes me
I sent them an email and they never responded back
Once everything is working perfectly, They are prolly gonna change their front end just to fuck with you
Well a lot of my stuff is queries (back end) so if they change the front end it won't be that hard to fix
So it can't be run atm
Couldn’t be me
To be honest there's probably a bot that already does that
sorry i’ll never be good enough for u adam
Yeah there's an API at least so I don't have to rewrite it
google not hard tho smh
it’s not hard i just feel like i have to give adam purpose
I wouldn’t survive without google
sad
You don’t cause you don’t know how to google it
Delete this shit
sad
Do you want it back
no we threw it away bc it was dead
oh
oh facts
thnx i need it
The real buddies get $6 tho so i gotchu
@everyone who is in the dental school so I can get some teeth cleaning
I stopped the bot because there's a problem lol
Tbh I probably could do that but I don't know how to do it, also mods are watching me 👀

It’s lame

Pls leave cleopatra
Oh rip that person

Sorry howdy
even if i doubt they'll b online, dont ping em
*tho, once again, big brains to nobel litterly creating it in like an hour*
we need jackbox
rip raunak
weather
why are we still here
I guess the same doesn't go for the '23 server
Lol bringing a dead server to life? Difficulty level impossible
Fair
Which is sad
In order to bring a server back to life you must acknowledge that it’s dead
Damn which server did you see die
Must be sad
And most of my group chats die
Can't relate
You need to be in a gc in the first place to see em die
Aw
There are so many dead group chats in my phone they’re taking up storage 🥲
One of them my friend forgot I was in it despite me talking in it the night before🤡
I could never
She didn’t, but when I spoke in it the next day she went “I forgot you were in this group chat”
Aw I hope you recovered from them
Fair
Honestly gc suck
I feel like it’s the most genuine of all
@djsurti you missed out on the fun last night man
I think some were on their phone
Cause my discord desktops vc sucks for some reason
So I’ll probs hop on on my phone
Ye on my laptop
Oh gotcha
I miss playing ping pong
I could play ping pong for hours
Now it sucks I can't go to table tennis club since I'm remote
Shit
Can’t remember
Idk if I’ve played
Aw all classes online the reason?
Higher risk of getting sent home earlier
So I don’t want that
Yeah it’s not a bad drive
2 hours
Gotcha not bad
Yeah not bad at all
Takes me 8-10 hours to get to casw
By plane🤡
Freaking sux
That we can’t go
Ugh I hope I can go next fall
I’ll be really sad if I can’t
And that will help me through college
I feel like if we survive this there’s nothing that can stop us
After midterms: work ethic gone
I hope I can improve my work ethic next semester I need it lol
My first semester was god awful
I still have Gen chem 2 and all of ochem
I could never handle sciences
Honestly Chem ain’t that bad
That I couldn’t focus on chem
Because I heard it’s hard
It’s really tough in the beginning
Oooo naming is kinda hard too
Since you were complaining
Nope it’s a fact
I couldn’t focus on chem because of bio
So I wasn’t doing well
I fell like there’s too much to remember
i haven't done bio yet but I still like it based on whatever i've learned from HS lmao
214 doesn’t even cover all of AP bio so you should be fine
Don’t know if the rest of AP bio will be in 215
@sprinkles2108 i thought they covered it over 3? isn't 216 all the biological systems stuff?
Bader just added history stuff cz he wanted to
yee idk for sure, but i feel like they would do that
I was never offered o chem at my hs so
But we didn’t learn much physiological stuff in AP bio
That was a separate class at my hs
But idk what 216 class is named
Idk
Me who’s never taken ochem looking at that like 👁👄👁
we don't rly have ochem at my hs but i did a little in soph year b/c they taught some in our chem class
o fuck
i'm scared for ochem but also physics
My hs didn’t teach ochem stuff in our chem classes
Oh same
I’m more worried for physics than o chem
I didn’t learn a single thing in AP chem so in chem 105 it was me and honors chem against the world
I didn’t take AP physics
I just didn’t pay attention in AP physics because of college apps
it’s impossible to dislike physics without hating math
ahh rip
I like math a lot but struggled in physics because I didn’t pay attention to it
Possibly, but I didn’t take AP physics C and mechanics in hs😳
idk?
when u don’t, it’s bad
RIP us in 121
I don’t think there’ll be a difficulty difference b/w 121 and 115 tho
Cause they can ask really hard algebra based qs too
I heard 121 is easier when not taken in the fall
And 122 is easier when not taken in the spring
Watch me fail 115✨
Watch me fail MATH 307 ✨
How guilty should I feel for eating food with someone else’s name on it
at work
ron, its like you dont kno proper sibling ediquitte, screw them cuz they'll do the same
Not anymore
Cant thonk right rip howdy
Lmaoo sorry
We FaceTime each other for literal hours now that we’re away
OH
OH?
but it bad
v bad
I haven't played Fallout 76 but I heard 4 is much better than 76
Have you already learned organic chemistry?
Is there anything that you don't know? 🧠
@addat frats are still on-campus
ope, did most never leave campus?
I actually don't know
did people leave the frats when thanksgiving started?
depends on if their house is owned by someone else or the school
@here who wants to have their life span shortened in half ?
how early on do you learn SN1/2 and E1/2? like, 2-3 weeks in?
our professor taught us the basics of SN1/2 and told us to memorize it so i'm considering reviewing if it's early enough on
Trump spittin wtf
@samrobot would you still want me if I am me
although i dont listen to them much rn
listened to them almost too much last year
and also the rule about respecting the mods goes above no hate speech lmaooooooo
good moderators don't need that rule, it comes naturally
it's weird to think that we're no longer the youngest class anymore for uni
now that there's a class of '25
60,000 doesn't need a party but we should do something at 75k
oh yeah sorry
Hey I didn’t make that rule
I feel old
Lemme hop on my flight
brb gonna go on a 6 hour drive to campus
There's actually benches outside so it's not a bad idea
i'm still not over the fact that i'm in college, like it's there but it also still feels weird @sprinkles2108
Yeah I still don’t think I’m in college
maybe it's cos of covid + shit lmao
I feel like I’m in summer camp
College is just not a real thing yet for me
I’m still in hs guys
even tho i was on campus ._.
COVID LEAVE YOUR RENT IS OVERDUE SO JUST LEAVE
oh shit-
Oh oof
awwww
oh dang BALLPOINT??? This is getting intense
I still use pencils
i feel tbh
I’m dumb and don’t trust myself so I use pencil lol
oh fucc
i just dislike the feeling of pencil on paper
I don’t have many smooth pens
i just dislike the feeling of writing
Anyway I’m moving away from actual utensils. iPad and Apple Pencil gang rise up
Could never give up the feel of pen or paper but it’s a lot more convenient
I still like my pencils❤️
She’s just a big brain so no need to erase
You don’t. You gotta do the exam all over again
My parents surprised me with them right before finals
Awww
I felt bad about it initially :(
Because they spent money on me LOL idk why I’m like this
Awww guys🥺🥺
Oh ew what
no you don’t
I asked my parents b/c I was like "i don't want to be lugging around notebooks irl" so they were like "ok"
It never let me do it on my computer
i did it on my comp and my drawing tablet kept dying on me or not working
Is anyone just so paranoid on making sure their pencil battery life doesn’t deteriorate fast? I keep mine separate unless it needs to be charged lol
I guess I overthink everything
I don’t even know anymore
Bahaha I’ve played around with the brushes but I didn’t have a ton of time
I just can't colour or shade for shit
aww
awwww
IDK my brain is absolutely mush. I've done 14 hours of MCAT in the past 2 days
Me but with chem for 2 weeks
don't burn out bro
I tried but the textbook is blehhhghh
I don’t wanna
ahh rip
I was talking about finals though
I studied so hard for chem
aww
I spent today trying to catalogue everything from bio
To the point where I was in physical pain
I have a break in 3 weeks scheduled
oh damn man
Yeah my neck went bye bye
I had a headache for 3+ days while studying for finals, but it was so bad that 2 advils, 1 extra strength tylenol and a nap wouldn't help
rip my liver
Oh my
ur poor kidneys and liver
Though
awww
Chem also gave me constant panik attacks in the 2 weeks leading up to the final
Oh no i'm sry :c @sprinkles2108
I'm happy tho b/c everything worked out ok in the end but god that was so bad
Oh noo
I'm just scared for bio? Like i started just looking thru the book a little and i'm already like 🥴
oh fuck
If you want I can share the drive with you
adv orgo is its own thing isnt it?
Maybe I’m wrong
Chem 321 does not exist anymore
Hasn't been taught in years
oh; well, thats a shame 😦
I heard reg is better but I don’t know
Well 421 is a grad class, so I don't know why I'd take it considering my masters is in public health
oh fr
Chem 323 isn’t intro
Who is the orgo teacher we want?
But my bio si said take 323 even if you don’t know orgo
Oh rip
Well knowing me I’m dumb and slow so I’ll take 223
Med schools won’t care that I took intro right?
So just study orgo in advance and take 323?
Because she's worried about her gpa
So just jump into reg? Rip
Does med school have GPA?
@toomanyzs how bad is orgo at case?
Like they don’t have A B C D
Do they have pass fail?
Not bad. Just don't be lazy or defeatist
Hard and bad are different
i mean to say, how hard was it @toomanyzs
It was a lot of work but doable
Would you say 323 is worse than 106?
Oh rip
Office hours really came in clutch for me though
fr fr - i'd sit there even if i didn't have questions
every time he had a bad day i assumed his kids didn't want to eat his baked goods
Is it bad that I miss drew lowkey Im so afloat rn
I have nothing to do
@anjalir519 that chem 105/106 stress keeps you on your toes
I did clean up on my MCAT full length though
I miss Drew too lowkey
I got above the average score people get w studying without studying
Yeah damn nice job
*harvard med school wants to know ur location*
I'm going to go to med school in antarctica
scary
I haven't left the house in 3 days
OH RIPPPP
do u normally leave the house
couldnt b me
I tried to walk outside today
It was so cold
Zach go to med school marry me
Nah I just got really cold cz I wasn’t wearing proper cold weather gear
you're not wrong  @toomanyzs
They seem so eager and undepressed by college
Ah fack only 2.5 weeks til j term
fuck
But now there’s a whole server
They do not want to talk to me
2024 is about as far as it goes
Now you know I’m scared of y’all
Why not 25 though
@anjalir519 scared of who?
Lots of them entering college makes me feel old
We have yet to get to RD
zach keeps lurking
I didn’t even join this server until after the semester started
Then Jenin pushes zhanda out of the tree to his death and nae naes over the body
I was in the server for a while and then left b/c i wasn't rly active at the time
IDK the concerns of mice and men
Oh to be sitting in a tree with someone whose eyes would pierce into the depths of my soul
I just wasn't rly active
Jenin really being simped after
Raunak sorry but jenin’s out of your league
Jenin when I first saw you in the chem recitation I couldn’t concentrate on the quiz
@toomanyzs how do u feel that ur own floor child didnt know u were pre med
The Palestinian sky folds its wings over you, carrying you, away to God's arms with its punctual, mysterious courtesy
RANAUK SIMPIN DAMN

Guys ok real talk I suck at initiation like i can’t even hit the follow button on Instagram

@anjalir519 he ended up being my BF for 14 months
Bruh you need to do this, slide into the DMs like we said
I went to shawnee in Lima
My stepdad literally drives to your town every day for work
@anjalir519 nah nah nah, i kept flirting with him but he was too stupid to get it so i had to be like "i like you"
I have a bad memory
worst thing they can say is that they're not interested
Girl I can’t even hit the follow button
NOOOOO I CANT
Is it bad that I thought you were referring to the Student Information System instead of "sis"
Another girl liked the person I dated eventually, and she came after me but he ended up dating me instead and now I regret it everyday so maybe being forward ISNT always the right move anyways
I just don’t wanna be awkward
Even if I lose the person
Pri aren't you already a mod?
Oh man I didn’t have to hide my bf from my mom I just kinda said be okay with okay ily and she was?
I'm white and both of the Desi girls I've dated had fathers who were -100000% happy that I was their daughter's boyfriend
After we ended it
oh my parents have got no idea period
My moms v young tho so I think that kinda helped
@toomanyzs oof rip
Bruh it's 11PM already? Too late I need to go get my sleep
Oh nah not rude at all

Go to #pets🐶😺 if you want your day 2 be improved 👍🏽

warriors lost to the nets
You’re no longer Indian
@sprinkles2108 damn am i not indian either then
What is he now if he’s no longer indian
On my phone
That’s so sad
Also I’m genuinely convinced that raunak actually hates me
People be out here losing indian but I have girls fathers hating me because I cannot become indian
@anjalir519 I'm sorry but Deepika Padukone, Kajol, like come on
oh gotcha
Kajol isn’t pretty imo
We already got rid of him
Idk if you know Sridevi
I was talking to a guy in Taft house one night at like 3 am, we were both working in the common room, and he showed me this sick indian rapper who I can't remember but his stuff was fire
Wrong one
Did I stutter? You so stupid you count twice
Damn
entammede jimikki kammal tho
i haven't watched it but the wardrobe 😻 @anjalir519
Don't watch Chinese tv
I don’t watch Indian tv
@sprinkles2108 girl i'm south indian, my parents don't do hindi movies
Internet explorer
@sprinkles2108 yee i don't understand hindi
Do Hindi’s and Muslims actually hate each other or this that just a Pakistan vs. India thing that’s way overblown
It’s a bad issue in India
This reminds me of you and pri dating last night
am bad with tone online
Don’t come 2 my city
I'm still caught on the 2025s because that makes me feel like an old old man
I’m confused does raunak genuinely hate my guts now
Oh I wasn’t there
come to the airport next time 🤡
Bruh who goes to Charlotte's airport
@chandachan will you come to pick me up from the airport when i arrive at cleveland?
He’s basically a middle schooler. This means one of two things 

He has a crush on you 

He actually hates you
I think he actually hates me LOLLLLLLL
Nahhh ranuak you wanna confirm you don’t hate pri
Lol he doesn’t have a crush on me
They haven’t let us pick them yet
Matthew’s? That’s about 20-30 away from me
that chat does need to be revived
People often hate their crush to repress the emotions they feel towards them girl
@sprinkles2108 oh no :c
Damn
Rip to all the kdrama male leads then 💀
is the RTA that bad?
arent the public transportation good in america?
public transit is terrible here
its cuz we underfunded it
due to lobbying from the car companies
clean the seat before you sit down and stay in that same seat for the rest of the transit
Also most people have a car so public transportation isn't as necessary
i cant drive tho
the reason so many ppl have cars is due to this lobbying as well
Cuz the house behind me has one
We need an "ope" emoji
roblox head
Actually I didn't know this but we do have an off emoji: :OOF:

Oh f
Why did you wake up so early smh
Six hours of sleep here 🤡
Just got the worst dorm at case
I GOT A SINGLE ROOM. FML
@kaori_flute is Hitchcock that bad?
But it’s worse than cutter I think
Cutter is the best isn’t it
so its gonna b worse
A missed opportunity
I’m sad rn
I don’t know much about Hitchcock
Idk if I should come now. Zazh told me Hitchcock is worse than death
Oh suites
my guess tho
never been inside
Size is different tho
@raunakwastaken you got a single room because everyone is living alone
cuz you might get lucky and have a double room
jenin you told me size doesnt matter 😔
What’s wrong with a single though
Everyone’s living alone
Oh f
@raunakwastaken it’s just one semester though
Oh what
Ugh
But I heard they’re still better
it isnt
Or not. I could be wrong
sigh
It’s not a corner room so it likely is a double but I guess not according to raunak
cause it says so
You don’t really need that much space anyway lol
Double turned single fam
Cause
it says single here
EVERYTHING IS SINGLE DUE TO RONA
HOLY SHIT
YOU'RE IN THE SAME ROOM I WAS IN LAST YEAR
really?
the one up, one med is a leftover from when they tried roomates during rona
Is full sized the thicker twin or the longer twin
raunak did since he wasnt on campus last semester
magnolia kinda bad tbh
I saw that it’s awful
Doubt it. It’s really limited
worst they can do is say no
they cant give you somewhere worse, cuz ur already there lmao
the amount of bullshit that happened in the first three weeks in hitchcock was incredible
I HAD CUTTER AND I THREW IT AWAY😐😭
flashbacks from room selection in july :eyes2:
Wow rip cutter 307
RIP
29 for me then
cuz it was 6 am or 7 am for me
Missed all the fun I guess
There are suitemates tho
Mine says double
Can have up to 7 suitemates tho
@raunakwastaken guo was in ur room last year, and said it was double
He had that room last year
Damn
suites arent different from dorms
so its still near same room number
due to rona
It is 12:05 pm and I have not left my bed
bruh im still having that headache
aren't we all
i think case doesnt like me
it was 58 inside my room b4 heating
its 45 inside
we dont have heating
Oh
welcome 2 being broke
isn't there a heating unit inside ur room?
yea, my laptop, with its fans spinning at the speed of sound
apparently
we can manually turn on heating inside our rooms
did not know that
Meanwhile im never on campus🤡
Oh
unfortunately :sadcat3:
If you want friends
Oh
since everything is single now
omg
i can't imagine sharing these bathroom with 19 more people
jenin didnt u do that during the semester anyways :thonk:
rip
pri: RIP cutter dorm, i wish i came
also pri: it was wise not coming, y'all r disgusting, yummy homemade food, teehee
I wouldn’t feel as bad
fair point
*Stochastic has left the chat*
cuz it's the first and last one
Jenin I can’t compete
raunak
u make people hate u
Unless y’all hate me🥲
sad
case why do you hate me?
you didnt bribe them enough
he got switched from good dorm to bad dorm
i got the worst housing
Is this said “worst” housing?
Haven’t spoken to him in a while though
Oh kush too?
cutler and hitchcock are considered the worst housings
KUSH DOESNT DESERVE THAT
RIP KUSH
Why is Hitchcock supposed to be bad?
hitchcock just has same problems as other dorms, but more of them
I can’t remember if he is
Oh
idk and idc
no wonder hitchcock sucks :D
`Henry Lawrence Hitchcock (1813-1873). He graduated from Yale College`
lmao got fax wrong
Wait no I was on google maps just now I couldn’t find the housing tho
I wont i promise
I would never 😤
Eye—👁👄👁
Fair
one time they were talking really loudly, and I could hear they were upset about being put in quarantine
I WANT FOOOOOOD
Damn that’s so Ohio
it really is
Idk
all the fast food u could need at 1am
BUT GUESS WHAT
FRICKIN' DEN IS CLOSED NOW
Crap im caught in the middle
But dunno if he will
He’s on this server don’t know if I should ping him. Anyway his name is Sam. He went to school in India actually
i would not be alive without case food
I dont know if i got his last name right
it is still edible
would have had stomach problems 24/7 :D
that is what happens when u dont got food
Not sm anymore :(
I don’t know that
Sir you don’t know him
the kitchens are closed
@raunakwastaken At least you told me you don’t him
He first told me he didn’t
be alone in thekitchen
WHEN I FIRST MENTIONED HIM TO YOU YOU WERE LIKE IDK HIM
i personally dont like that style of living
no they arent
isn't quad corridor
Wtf I’m so confused now lmao
See @raunakwastaken Hitchcock aint that bad
spoilers, you dont use groupme, ez
How do washrooms work now?
washrooms work the same they did
@howdy_. you had it wrong
Isnt Clarke like super small tho
Looks super high tech tho
clarke was the party tower last semester
somehow meg was able to escape
cuz room n board is a huge part of their money making scheme
yeah but being tied w a lease also means that u dont have to pay extra to stat over the summer if u have a job or research opportunity
meg out here working the big leauges
is ksl still open?
break in and find out ;)
mayhaps
too far tho :nkolost:
last time i checked they were like closed bc person w covid
u can apply to live off campus for soph yr if covid is still around :)
like all i did was fill out a form and be like im not living on campus bc covid makes me feel unsafe
Oh, so sophomores this year got permission to live off campus
I mean for those who don’t have a place in Cleveland?
under normal circumstances u have to live on campus for 2 years, then u can leave or stay on campus
you bunk w/ someone who does
50miles tho is alot
i know someone that commutes from pittsburgh so
Sorry I’m poor
not 50 miles away but shes a nurse
for 12 MONTHS
Fair, @_frostyyyyy_
If plenty of people are broke to begin with
This is so sad
i'd do it if it wasn't for that stupid 2 years of on campus housing requirement
Sorry why is this a requirement to begin with?
probably because money
What if u just don’t lol
Do u get expelled or do they withhold your fucking degree HAHAHAH
like my suite was emptied bc of the not letting sophomores on campus so it was basically just gonna be me and they were gonna put me w ppl i didnt know or trust to be safe outside so i was like. no
Are there consequences if you don’t fulfil this requirement I mean
i thought it was just you have to spend 2 years on on campus housing, doesn't need to be the first two
you can probably find a place off campus
but if you don't fulfill it by the last semeter
but i still don't know if the 2 years on campus housing is still a req
i dont think so lol
guo pls marry me i want the green card
Another thing is that it says that the university will grant exceptions if the student makes an argument for why it would be in their interest
now i can go abroad next year if i don't go back to campus this semester
oh
gg
ksl is closed
good thing i did not go :nkolost:
When they didn’t let me in🥲🥲
Girl I’m wide awake as if I got 8 hours of sleep
Then went back to sleep
Don’t quote me on that💀
There are actual virtual pe classes but a) they are consent only so I'd assume it's for seniors who can't come to campus and need the pe requirement
The 2025 situation is just wack and the 2025 server is going to be a lot deader than this one as a result, unfortunately
I mean we actually have a lot of members here but there aren't that many active unfortunately
Btw my projects got put in so I can actually calculate what I need on the exam
Lemme guess a 20%
Nah everyone needs to get at least a 50 to pass regardless of everything else
I need a 65%, which means I need 28 more points than i last saw my grade on the final
> Nah everyone needs to get at least a 50 to pass regardless of everything else
sadly qq
That means that you got around a 100% on everything before the final... 🧠
Lol it doesn't matter tho, it's not like I'm getting a 4.3 or something smh
So with AP you probably have that many credits
cuz u are a big brane
What does kaori mean? I searched for it on Google and apparently it's a Japanese name, but I'm assuming that there's some context I'm missing @kaori_flute
Oh god yes I’ve met these people, please don’t lump me in with them
I don’t plan to graduate early and I’m not a big brain either lemme be a freshmen
Lol I don’t have enough credits to be a sophomore
Bruh I'm not a sophomore, at least I don't think so
i don’t understand how the 25 server was bad enough to start over
500 people👍 i mean we aren’t all active but still
yeah i honestly didn't submit any of my credits for case
ya i mean i didnt know they had randos joining the server
ik our server never had that problem
I’ve gone to some extra curricular meetings
omg i didn’t know random ppl were joining that’s weird
i hate that bs
i dont care
They just want validation✨🤡
Oh I’m scarred from k-12 so I’ve become emotionally mature I think
@anjalir519 @sprinkles2108 he rly tried to mansplain to me on day one
wtf?
ugh ew
Oh boyyyyy
You’re a BAD ASS GO OFF BOSS B
he took credit for stuff i said and then refused to admit he was wrong when he ended up messing up a problem by saying 48/44 was less than 1
so is there any 25 server left?
so i wonder where those college level credits went for him to go up to the next level @sprinkles2108
@sprinkles2108 mans too scared of ruining his gpa... and it's better for him to get his ego stroked
He fished so hard to have his ego stroked
I wasn't in Chem105 this sem but I will be in 106 next sem
oh gotchu, we can suffer tgth @nobelium19
I wish
he was in my math recitation too @anjalir519
Fingers crossed that there’s enough people I’ll never have to speak to him
Omg bad luck gotchu
Since most were in 105
he had such a weird expression on his face when he saw me standing outside the classroom waiting for a friend @anjalir519
yeah idk why he was creeping in the groupme @anjalir519
He left the chem groupme
Also idk if we should dox here
Oh is he the one who said that the exam was easy
Someone told me about that
You already have an award named after you, so i wouldn't be surprised
I saw this and thought ICE chart damn
i already forgot 75% of 105
Y’all need to stop talking about chemistry
Can’t buddy we’re taking 106 next semester and still have ochem to tackle
Trust me you don’t wanna
i'm sorry
Why did you delete everything tho. Tf
I haven't had paneer in a while
zachary you need to come to chennai one day
Oh shit I played some cricket with a resident
All Indian men are hardcore cricket fans prove me wrong
You can’t
And you won’t
You don’t wanna know why
Also apparently Andrew Yang's running for mayor of NYC?
I remember his MATH hats
I want a MATH hat
Fuck MSNBC while we’re at it
Won’t happen because this country needs help✨
Vc. Now. If y’all want

@addat oh man i'm so sorry, thoughts and prayers ❤️
Oh my goodness @addat I’m really sorry to hear that. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers as well💙
~11 hours of sleep✨
:( sorry man
I just read the chat
I'm really sorry to hear about that that @addat wishing peace, you have thoughts and prayers. It is hard for you, but it's easier for it. It will not suffer anymore :blobcrigif:  we're here if you want to talk
@addat I’m sorry I’m late but just know we’re thinking about you and everything will end up okay
It’s so faint here ugh
FINAL EXAM
Not in SIS yet unfortunately
But that does mean I'll end up with >100% in the class
Sorry for not responding earlier, I was exercising
My final grade in the class is 98.7%
Imagine doing physical activity, couldn't be me
Ah damn rip my grade
What happened?
You still got an A in the class though, right?
So you didn’t fail at all
It isn’t
For us elites it still is
Ugh perfection
ITS REALLY FUNNY IM SORRY
Cause she has a sense of humour
Half hour???????
Y’all couldn’t have picked a whole number?
Do y’all even know how time zones work? We can’t “pick” it
Case closed
CASE closed
Hell, I didn’t read that book
That quotes from animal farm tho
I didn’t read that either
We never read Animal Farm
We didn’t read 1984
I think we were allowed to choose and I didn’t wanna
RIP Snowball, that's all I have to say
1984 was boring but again I only read 10 pages of it
Still don’t know how I finessed that unit in 9th grade
Animal farm was the book that made me realize that communism would work if not for human nature and that some human will always want power
But I want my freedom to live how I want
wasn't the author a socialist though
I almost got wacked in the face by a cow’s tail last time I was in India
I guess 1/3 of them aren't educated smh
1/3 were killed unfortunately
They won’t give me visa tho
Raunak’s never on the chem groupme tho
This seems more plausible
I don’t have Amazon prime though so f
If Raunak says yes then don't watch it
Howdy do be lowkey stalking us tho
Yeah this seems believable
Can someone stream it on zoom
I can’t cause Amazon will bonk me
Can we stream on zoom though?
Will zoom streaming not work either?
I guess not
I could do that tho
Umm you sent like titration notes and also the math word problems that I couldn’t attend. Remember??
I’m so bored
Hi so bored, im howdy
Idk
Cause trump
tru, but the 1st one is still a classic
I haven’t watched either
We did talk for 8 hours before
Bruh it used to work so well 2 years ago
Please accept me to med school pls
I’m begging u fbi don’t flag me
We need a minecraft server
Daytime my family will not leave me alone
dunno how popular it is
Oh so about 3 hours
I bet Nobelium was taken smh
I really suck at this
I miss Minecraft
Forgot my login info though
I did too but luckily there's forgot my password
Idk how minecraft servers work in the slightest
It’s my brothers account but I’ve logged in on my computer before just to mess around
Worst case scenario I buy it again with my own money lol
Bruh he's not German tho
Awww F
Bruh we should all play minecraft tho, I heard they added dolphins or something
lowkey want to major, but there's 32 credit hours
With any engineering major that’s hard
Switch to neuro, it’s bme but without the engineering🤡
BME, and I can't fit more than 1 frch course in each semester's courseload
I mean I don't
What does neuro have to do w being big brain though😭
You gotta be big brain to study it
Watch me die🤡
I want to, but I have to load up every semester🤡
Yes I feel this as sad as that is
5/19, if you couldn't tell from my username
Don't worry, my birthday present is my last final exam 🤡
I checked my final exam schedule already
Oddly enough BIOL215 is missing from the schedule
I took 19 this semester and I’m taking 21 next sem
Nah not really they’re all fairly easyish classes
Idk man
214 wasn't the worst thing in the world
That class stole my mental health and soul
Drew sounded so much worse from what I was hearing
Nah chem was way less work imo
Nowhere near chem
Bio was just so much work
Bruh really? Imo BIOL214 wasn't that much work, but I slacked off as much as possible
My Sociology class tho
I mean it's a lot of work
I’ve never taken sociology
Anyways I'm STILL downloading Minecraft smh
And we seem to have lost everyone else
ik ppl that had a bad prof and it sucked
i had belkin but unfortunately i do not think he teaches anymore
Oh
Oh bruh
I mean it's a lot of work but I don't consider it a hard class
Compared to bio how hard is it? And how much work?
It's much easier, provided that you don't get behind in work, a lot more work in terms of assignments and stuff, but they're mostly graded by completion and/or have multiple attempts on quizzes and stuff
i didnt
i only had 4 exams and that was it
I didn't either
Oh great that doesn’t sound too bad
It isn't that bad
How hard were the exams?
And did they require a camera because the camera gives me anxiety
Not very hard, don't mean to brag but I didn't study much but got 100% on both of the first 2 exams
So I slacked off on the 3rd exam and probably got a D 🤡
But it doesn't matter at that point
Also don't buy any textbooks
I didn’t lol
If I can’t access what she has I’ll reach out to you
Bruh I really wanted to play Minecraft today but if this continues I won't be able to smh
Idk
you arent running a server
Oh I don't have to download it?
big brains just cant do smol brain activities smh
OMG I'm so STUPID
u dont need it to join server
didn't even know this video existed till now
anyone want to play jackbox or something?
I can’t play today. I’m out
@addat merry christmas adam, I feel as if a part of me has also been torn upon hearing the news about your dog. If you need to confide in someone, I will always be there for you and your family, to whose politeness I am greatly indebted for the gift you handcrafted and sent me
damn
feels like -12
And it’s SO COLD
Any tips on dealing with the cold

lol Fresno so cold brrrrrr
RIP

Imma die
I’m used to Indian weather
Feb isnt as bad
But it’s highly probable that I don’t come to campus.
My parents now don’t want me to go
Really?
Raunak we can't perform WAP 😦
mmmm
like
wear double masks on the plane
face shield if necessary
Cold rejection
This new Carti might be the worst album I ever listened to
God damn
He’s so ass man. I feel bad for his fans. Not only is their taste shit they waited 3 years for this shit
rip
My expectations were low but HOLY fuck
Never seen such a collective agreement
https://twitter.com/lysssaaajackson/status/1342344691820482560?s=21

It took him THREE YEARS to make this shit???????
Oh That’s Bad
carti went off in magnolia and wokeuplikethis

Apparently second half of the album was actually decent but
Bro I made it to like 4 songs and just couldn’t go anymore

Then it Broke
sorry for being nosy
I was about to open up my laptop but it’s only been 3 minutes
I don’t like that steam tracks how many hours of playtime
I saw that I had 90 hours for the past 2 weeks
70 of those hours have been in the last week
I can come up with the shitty excuse of being sick but I’m sure even once I feel better I’d rack up the same hours :smile_bruh:
Omg storm wallpaper is back
My laptop is Alive
I will give up if it didn’t autosave
Oh god it didn’t save anything I did for the past hour :sadcat3:
firewatch tho
The last hour was mostly me going through the tutorial
Which is the get money code
It started me off with 20k simoleans but I feel like that won’t be much when I actually start remodeling
Just wanted to more formally thank everyone for the support i received today, it really means a lot to me. The procedure happened in the morning, so since then I've just been sleeping because time doesn't exist when you pull an all nighter. Felling a bit better now though, and I can't wait to get the fuck out of 2020 and see a lot of you in a few weeks on campus. Again, thanks so much, and I hope that everyone has a merry xmas.
@addat fake plastic trees be hitting hard
rip i don't have spotify, but I will listen to it for you
Parents won’t let me drive in the snow :P
Yeah fair
Also idk why I’m up so early
I crashed last night

I’m very scared about what I’ll remember saying  this cah pack
I checked some and didn’t find anything I said
i took 1 thing from all quotes, so theres somethings that r urs in there :P

well im wrong, cuz the folder says 316 items
My cleaning achievement
u sure it aint
sleepy
i wish cah would have image cards
cuz then all the emotes would b in there
omfg that would be sick
Hey guys, I want to wish you all a merry Christmas. Discord is full of copypasted Christmas messages, that people don't even read and just forward to other servers. I don't like that. I like to write what I deeply wish and what comes from my heart. Our friendships, from the most deep ones to the most virtual ones are very important and will never be represented by a simple message copied from elsewhere. This being said I would like to thank all of you. You are the best hockey team I've ever played with. A big hug, Sarah.
so, DnD - dungeons n dragons, DND - do not disturb, so my head was borked there for a mo
and forgot to change the dnd part
Without dnd
why is twitter spazzing over the fact that cashiers in the US don't get to sit
Missing the last special ingredient I guess
oh yeahhhh
i never knew aldi had that policy til i saw the post
yeah i'd like to sit at work smh
Bc fuck that
Why do u need chair in mall store?
Oh ye
im either sitting or walking about
oh i think just decoration ig
idk
When I don’t work
work while sitting
I think we should go back to trading, money makes no sense
They just have that immigrant money sense
Rip
i haven't had dinner yet
Christmas isn’t over for you guys?
Est kinda slow ngl
ope, i forgot most ppl do it tonite
@chandachan my mom sometimes fasts for 11 weeks straight
idk why
that seems
for 11 weeks
Internet finally working
she's purely vegetarian for 11 weeks
idk what's the meaning behind it
Some can’t eat during daylight
Nah it still counts
isnt fast like no food
I mean nowadays it doesn’t mean completely no eating
she ate fruits today np
but she also can't have certain veggies
Ahh ok sorry for being bosy
GUYS ONE WEEK TIL 2021
Oh really?
@nobelium19, @chandachan and I want to adopt you
I’m at work sorry :(
rip
Odds Pri gets rona from work?
P low rn it’s so slow today
How sad do you have to be to shop the day after Christmas
The amount of people who don’t know how to properly wear masks is ✨concerning✨ but since this is America it ain’t surprising at all
Someone walked in
ahhhh that happened to me at the den :D
They do know how to properly wear them. They’re just selfish assholes who don’t want to do so because it is an inconvenience to them
If I don’t get Covid (symptomatic or not) I will be shocked
Not that I want it. Heaven forbid
But still
ehhh, I don't like it that much lol
Dawg that shit kicked my fuckin ass
I’m sure it did :( someone from my hs graduating class got it and his mom would post updates and talk about how he would complain that it felt like there were glass pieces in his throat
So scary
But anyway, people don’t take this seriously and I hope they do one day smh
Deadass I didn’t get out of bed for like 3 days except to use the bathroom. I was in the torture chamber 

Worst part was my dogs couldn’t be near me because pets can get it too
oh damn
though still enjoyable
It’s already off to a bad start
Never mind that shit was fake carry on 🙏🏽
Can we just skip to the part where Covid is gone
I don’t care what year it is
But she felt sad one day 😦
she was really really really really sad:SniffSneezeTears:
Yeah poor girl :( she has it real bad guys
Still don’t get how her and Charlie got famous but go off everyone
I think it was due to Charli’s dancing, and she’s a genuinely talented girl but the entire family just profited off of it 💀
They are decent looking women and the internet is full of simps
I’d hate to be famous at this age
Not so much though I haven’t been too active lately
When it’s 1:53 and you haven’t stolen a dance from a BIPOC yet
Oh
Stupid ass
I could NEVER survive under that kind of pressure
I couldn’t either😭 I’m very introverted at times and I’d crack
And the hype never lasts so long to be sustainable
Have you seen them cry on the internet?
Have you seen the house they cry in?
But once they lose the hype
The money dies down
Fuck a stable job gimme them M’s
Who reviews toys and shit
Sadly I’m not hype-material
Nah I don’t know him
@raunakwastaken sir just because I didn’t tell you about my experience doesn’t mean I never was depressed
Bad look Raunak
I don’t know I can’t remember
With Christmas 364 days away, people who already have their decorations up, why?
Despite the fact that I am nor Christian not do I believe in Jesus, I am wearing Christmas pajamas and sitting next to my Christmas tree 364 days from Christmas and I will never be able to explain to you why
It’s kind of a tiny tree because we used to live in an apartment up until 6 months ago so it doesn’t really fit the size of the new house
Oh
Christmas came early for me
But it’s really softtt
Should’ve probably gotten a bigger size though
Not me with my airpods that are 4 years old still
No same though
I’m shocked mine still work
I don’t have a case
Well I didn’t my friend bought it for me but adorable nonetheless
I clean my AirPods like every 2 days because I get so paranoid
Why is this so true tho
I don’t trust the keychain
I just carry them lose
I don’t hang it on things, I just put it on the inside of my backpack
Not that I had AirPods when I went to school
I know someone who lost her AirPods SO many times
“GUYS LOST MY AIRPODS IM GETTING NEW ONES”
I get scared when I forget I am charging them and can’t find them
My dad has lost his AirPod twice
If I lost my AirPods my parents would teach me a lesson and simply not buy me new ones for a while
No I didn’t
This girl has gone through 10+ pairs of airpods
Yooo that’s scary
Well I don’t know to be exact
She flexed her richness in middle school and beginning of hs
But idk if she still flexes lol
I don’t know her addy
Unpopular opinion: I don't use AirPods or any Apple products because I want to avoid walled gardens as much as possible.
Apple tries to prevent you from downloading software outside of their App Store. Android and Windows don't
For most people this doesn't really matter
Yeah it doesn’t
Since most apps are available on both platforms
Mac is a little better, but for iPad and iPhone it's a lot more restrictive
I think an iPad/tablet is v convenient in college
I still don't use the Windows Store on Windows 10 🤡
so i kinda need to use windows
I mean for my phone I don’t do anything except like, text people, so Apple is easiest for me
Only my phone is Apple
i do a ton of stuff on my phone
Close enough
not really something that an Iphone is used for
My laptop is windows Bc I want steam and windows is just easier imo
Yea see tech wizard shit
Steam do be used on my laptop
I don’t require much
I like that my laptop does The Flip
phone is for on-the-go emulation
my laptop is for the heavy duty stuff
So I don’t mind mac
It's about freedom, I guess. Anybody that wants to have an app that has purchases needs to pay Apple a massive 30 percent cut or get their app removed from the App Store and then no Apple hardware users can download their software.  I am glad to hear that they are reducing their cut to 15 percent for most developers soon
Dang  rip Priyanka
I don’t care really
It’s also p fast and *COUGH* DOESNT ERASE CHEM LAB REPORTS
I don’t pay for my apps lol
I won’t ever use them lol
you can't really do that on apple
I don’t use many apps on my laptop
I don’t even have games
I use it for communication and work
Cant steam on phone?
Welp don’t need that either
And faster than any other windows computer I’ve interacted with
For phone I want Simple
For laptop i want games and Flip
I don’t have the patience for Apple ecosystem or wtv
Do you mean that your laptop is a two-in-one that can become a tablet?
I don’t need a touchscreen for my laptop
*even though I recently got an iPad but shhhh*
Oh my laptop is always plugged in idc abt battery life
Ye laptop came w stylus
Typing notes works horribly for a lot of things in math and science so for those I sometimes have to write on paper
My laptop was basically the price of apple laptop I think
But my priorities turned to windows
an equivalent apple laptop?
Apple laptops don’t flip
I actually liked it a lot when studying for my chem and bio finals
because an apple laptop would have cost almost one and a half times as much as my current laptop would have with the same specs
Nope
And probably never will
Oh so like if I got a custom Mac w the same specs?
i've also got touchscreen, but i don't like it
I didn’t want a touchscreen for my laptop because sometimes I try to point at stuff and physically touch the screen on my mom‘s laptop which is a Windows and would mess things up￼
Cant live without it
Not really a laptop thing for me￼
Ah I only use phone or laptop
I don’t bother w a tablet since I have laptop
I use phone, tablet, and laptop
Since it’s touchscreen and it flips it’s basically a tablet
In apple that’s basically the iPad Pro but you have to buy a keyboard separately to turn it into a flip laptop LOL
I get that most people probs don’t want touchscreen but it should still b an option smh
Rip
Fair
Idk how to work text to speech
But Apple wants to stay quirky
Goodness it’s so cold
Rip
Why r ur fingers so cold
Because I was sitting in a car that was turned off in 25-degree weather for like 15 minutes
aw dang, spending time w/ fam made me miss the lovely why pc is better than mac in allways convo
Isn’t boots gray
Sorry
Leaving your mum alone to do errands smhhhhh
I was too tired lol
Plus it wasn’t much
anyone want to play jackbox?
I can’t play
oh crap lol
didn't realize you guys were playing
Still playing jackbox?
sorry how do you join
I thought it was ok but a ton of people seem to hate it
They normally call them TVs tho
I was weak and sacrificed MCAT time for fAmIlY cHrIsTmAs TiMe yesterday and I've been going for 9 hours today
However I did get a nasty piece of news today that both of the March MCAT dates are completely full so I have notis in if one opens up or 1. I'm going MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE and taking it on Jan 25 with 5 weeks of studying or 2. I'm going to just have to take it early april
i would take it early april...
didn't you say you were planning on taking a gap year?
rushing the mcat and taking it in january isn't a good idea. this isn't the ACT
I would think ppl would wanna get this shit done
ik someone who's now at upenn med school say you shouldn't rush the mcat
lol no this isn't hs
It does not unfortunately
if you take the mcat more than twice in a year it doesn't look good
Oh yikes
cuz your mcat scores expire after 3 years
and 7.5 hours long
meanwhile im exhausted after one semester of freshman bio and chem :cri:
Wait how many questions would you have to miss to.score above a 510
for those who don't know:
MCAT is broken into 4 sections:
1. Biology and Biochemistry
2. Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS)
3. Chemical and Physical Basis of Biological Sciences
4. Psychology and Sociology
Each section has 58 ish questions and is then converted from raw score to a score from 118-132
Your total score is then from 472-528, with a 500 being 50th percentile, 508 being Average DO matriculant, 512-513 for MD matriculant, 515-519 is the "Turns heads Zone" 
520-524 is the "God Mode Zone"
525-528 is the "Harvard would like to know your location Zone"
You can't
My diagnostic was 500-501, and after 24 hours of just Bio study I moved to a 504
i can't tell just from the section names alone
oh fat rip
In that class
I don’t understand it but if you’re making money go for it beepers and boopers
after hearing about what my parents do in the IT industry i was way too bored by cs
ugh
that's so boring
ugh
Nun wrong wit having an OF tbqh
Incels called iDubbz a Simp because his girl had an OnlyFans was the funniest shit I seen in 2020 man LMFAO

Yeah couldn’t be me
I mean idubbz isn't a simp since he's not the one paying for it (I hope)
Neuro is scary and hard no thanks
I did unfortunately miss my goal this week

Mandatory Chinese history (all 5000 years of that shit) ptsd
Last day of 2020
Holy shit
I can't believe it, because it deletes shit so quickly it makes ghost pings even more effective
Fuck howdy ia going to mute me
y'all this is getting annoying :cat_gun:
Bro it's fine ping everyone and ask howdy to ban you, then it will be impossible because spartan bot says that can't happen
Big brain that shit
I was once stuck in Medina when a band of native meccans decided to launch a raid on my caravan
the end.
does @'ing everyone even work for anyone unless they're a mod? I thought they sealed the last few holes in that net
What happened
I don’t think so
Oh 💀💀
fuck
ping someone innocent like jenin, she'll do it
RIP Adam, we will not forget you
@howdy_. don't ban adam please
I'm not scared y'all should be thanking me for exposing spartan bot
if gater was still on this server it would be a disaster
gater is still on here
bruh you again pinged someone
Sorry Howdy
just want to test it out
15 hours left of 2020 on the west coast!
12 hours :cb_evil_panda:
I love how we all pretend that 2020’s problems will just magically go away because the year changed
so annoying, it's affecting meme culture too so sad
Big F for all the flash games, so sad, I had so many memories with those games, I even played with little cousins and kids I gave classes to  😦
It’s 2021 and all of the problems are still there
OMG
Coolmathgames was ran by the cartel
less than 6 hours till rip
7 hours
thats still est
Hey @ stochastic sorry for pinging you yesterday I thought you wrote the bot and not nobel but there are too many big cs brains here to keet track of
Yeah I just got rid of the command entirely, there's really nothing I can do about those pings, I mean I can configure the bot to mute after a couple of pings but I don't think anyone wants that and also that'd be a lot of more work for me
David isn't a CS big brain per se, he's in his own league
Also the timer in #deleted-channel is a little buggy but it's because I'm pushing the rate limit of Discord's API apparently
Nothing I can do about that
Be careful what you wish for or your 10:30AM Drew Meyer announcements may turn into your 7:30AM Drew Meyer announcements
Nothing better than waking up at 730 to hear how to make home made snickers bars when you don't like snickers
Imagine still being in 2020
no, I prefer the protein ones cause then you feel like you are eating a balanced meal. They are more moist and less crumbly
Oh didn't know there were nature valley protein bars
I’ve never had those
it has to be the peanut butter chocolate type tho, the salted caramel type is sus
I'll take you to rite aid and show you everything you've been missing out on
that's a lie but if I was very bored I'd do that
so you only "practically" do it in Thwing? That's a shame
as im new i dont rlly go out all that far
Howdy's job is to make the internet go brrrr
yea zhanda, i need that IOLab hookup
cuz scummy bizness go brrr
nintendo released a "snes" that was a raspi w/ roms taken from the internet for a few hundo
so doesnt surprise me others do similar things
I feel like they should open source the iOlab
Watch nobel leave phys lab at the end of the year, having invented iOLab 3.0
Y’all I’m sleepy and it’s not even 11
I’ve had enough coffee today though
I’m single though
I’m single but go off chief
I will gladly stay single as long as I need to
howdy please mute them in all channels except #couples-therapy
sorry, i was getting hungry
@sprinkles2108 dont judge you've never eaten leutner
oh shit
I hope I never do
I thought of cameron's dish earlier
Pork isn’t any better
isn't that a nice thing in india tho, to call someone a cow?
No I don’t think so....?
Oh
I mean all my problems are still here so...
Bruh if y'all are Zhandaya I'm going to ping the wrong person
Nobel I have my notifications off you can ping me as much as you want
If I get lost
Zhanda if I ever get lost I’ll call you to let you know I’m lost
Lol I could but I'm telling you Ohio aint got any hurricanes and amber alerts wouldn't be applicable if you weren't in the area
Oh it’s Raunak
40 minutes left and then yes
I’m just waiting for Covid to magically go away
Scrolling through my snap stories I’m disappointed but not surprised
I say those who were highly irresponsible during this pandemic be dead last in line to receive the vaccine
ha, *dead last*
*says that even though GOP senators have already received the vaccine*
oh shit howdy hivemind
I just want him out
Wish Polio woulda finished its job frfr
26 minutes til Covid goes away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Heroin, corn, and poor white people
> Heroin, corn, and poor ~~white~~ people

Fuck 2020
Anyone want to play jackbox?
Nah I want to sleep but neighbors keep setting off fireworks

It Hurts to be one this year

How does it feel to have never stepped into est
We’re not surrounded by polluted air
I'm surrounded by trees n shit
And at least our farmers aren't protesting
damn when was the last time I had corn
Shit will get political
Indian politics isn’t taken seriously here
The US media protects us from international crap
Cows block the streets in India though, Adam
Were both wrong it's ranauk he's a cow
omg where's khadija
imma ghenghis kahn that shit and whoop ur stupid mughal empire in the ass and pull up with the mongol empire
I’m not even kidding
Sorry Ron someone mentioned geography

Bonk him urself fuck it
discord says I'm transmitting audio at the correct volume
Jenin, you got ur wish
we tried to edit it but it was taken down after 30 secs
Adobe Flash Player, 24, Software, Early form of internet images, videos and games throughout the 2000s
we were not big brained enough to switch it to live view until it was too late
Basically anyone with connections. I've talked to some random ass people, like people I met on planes, people through my lobbying group, just about all of our family friends. This was all last summer, and I got an internship through someone my uncle went to business school with back in the 90's. It went well but it was very random.
sick
Wow getting upset at sparkles
Jenin, you've got to let go, pings aren't a thing anymore. Not since... the accident
OH MY
I DIDNT KNOW YOU HAD THAT ROLE
SORRY
IM REALLY SORRY
beck is annoying
i've been awake
for a few hours
julia and i are gonna go to eurowafel without beck so
I keep saying I will go to eurowafel but then get too tired to leave to go
Charlotte hornets NBA finals?
I like how case did everything to say it wasn’t med and nursing school students who would get vaccinated
Just realized that residents would get vaccinated thru their hospitals so it rlly is jus nursing students
Would anyone actually be upset if they found out they wouldn’t be first in line?
raunak isnt allowed the vaccine, i cant believe the email would single him out like that
They’re vaccinated thru their hospitals
In terms of the case demographic tho
but the execs working from home w/ their thousands in school funded equipment need to first so they can party
would any students be actually upset finding out they weren’t first among students at case
We don't even go outside anyways
plus like... haven't the nursing majors already had outbreaks 👀
To get into the hospital you have to be sick
But it’s working at least
Like all single rooms, dining hall is closed for eating inside unless u reserve, dining hall only serving takeaway, technically not being able to go to other ppls dorms
I mean we aren’t allowed, it’s a punishable offense, but ppl will still do it anyway
damn
the power of nerd school
Isn't rit also... nerd school?
It was the only college I toured where the guides gave off severe weeb vibes
how bad?
O fuck
That’s bad bad
I’m at work right
Idk if it was actually him though
pri working after christmas and new year :eyesmagik:
How sad do you have to be to go to the mall on the second day of the year
looks like people are more sad on the second day of the year than they are on the day after christmas
Holy crap
Tbh I can’t remember
It doesn't seem like the world has gotten more terrible in 2021 yet
Its debatable whether 2002-2007 actually happened
Although it’s automatically worse on covid cases alone
this time last year
killing people
Around this time last year we were memeing about WW3
@zackt7718 alabama finna do some illegal shit to osu
Oh
its not even 10 pm and im v sleepy
but i must get through this psych lecture rip
You didn’t ask me Zhanda
adam i want to apologize for tagging everyone in that server
Lmao I still can’t believe that worked
Idk why me saying I’d betray my religion for that random guy didn’t tick them off
i will say, now y'all see why a nsfw chat in a disc is a bad idea, esp for a school one, it attracts ppl like that
then they kinda just left
many months ago
if you scroll up far enough in #bruh-chain its probably there
I hate those ads
Oh and @addat did you see what I posted before I left?
partly cause its a political statement but still
Oh I mean my very very last post
Oh dammit I guess the image didn’t load before I left
Oh sorry deleted it from phone, Adam do it plz
What would you do if they pulled up at your door raunak
might have been ja tho
bruh i feel so bad for making fun of mormons when I have a mormon friend
I also feel bad for making fun of mormons, but my lies have gotten too deep for me to dig out of them
dont you feel bad for them tho
They’ve stopped you in the street?
bruh imagine if we went to BYU
but ive had some awk convos with mormons at my state school campus
fuck the mariners
If we went to BYU and dropped the f-bomb :cursed_flushed:
this is actually not true, for a while we had some of the worst covid rates for any university cause parties
I know someone who goes there
Idk about you guys
My mom would open the door
They’d leave
When did this happen?
Living in an apartment is rlly the moves it seems
Several years ago then it stopped one year
Plus we stopped answering the door to them
Damn
Yeah low key it was annoying
But oh well at least it’s stopped
But it stopped way earlier than that
Oh that was howdy
So yeah you get stopped in the street
I don’t know why or how
8ball always says the opposite about me tho :D
but dunkin was closed
It doesn’t lie
don't spam
we've found, as long as she keeps :simp: ing, she has nitro
Oop that’s bad news for raunak
Poor guy
rip him
Don't mind me I"m just being dumb 🤡
Wow random thought but idk if this ever happened to y’all when you were in English class and for whatever reason the Bible was mentioned (Bcz I guess we only read classic Christian/European works cz apparently that’s the only work that ✨matters ✨)
And like I didn’t know wtf was goin on cz I had literally never read the Bible? Cz I’m not Hindu
even in my sages class
But then my white ass teacher would shame me for not knowing
And I was like miss maam I don’t shame you for not knowing anything ab my religion plz cool it
I hate where this is going already
I feel like when in doubt u just believe what the colonized country's viewpoint is,
after all they were the recipients of the damage caused by the colonizing country, and my teacher goes "see? there's bias on both sides! The indians and brits were both exaggerating!!"
I feel like that’s just contradictory
hypocritical really
Heyyyy Drew isnt thaaaaat bad
If I’m gonna have white male teachers that’s the vibe I want
i feel like he was a little rude sometimes tho
Office hours especially
Oh yes fs if he was in a bad mood he’s very much rude
He gets giddy near exam times when we’re ab to fail
I just asked him during office hours how many multiple choice and short answers there would be
But normal office hours he tends to be kinda cranky and moody
Which sadly for a bunch of hyperactive nerds
Everytime he's in a bad mood I assume his kids didn't want to consume his baked goods that day @anjalir519 @djsurti
At the end of the day he just wants the best for our education
Because although him not answering questions really annoyed me sometimes if I didn’t have the answers
I kind of get what he was trying to do
I honestly feel like we  taught ourselves the material
I do wish he walked us through more stuff yeah
awwww
He didn’t care if we laughed, he laughed and that’s what mattered
awww
I didnt do anything i promise🥺
when you've done so many equilibrium problems that you automatically draw equilibrium arrows instead of the normal ones for the rxn
Guys I’ve already forgotten so much material from chem 105
Can't forget Chem 105 if you didn't take it
I logged into ALEKS 2 weeks ago to see how much chem I remembered for the giggles
And I remembered nothing
Can't get rejected from medical school if you don't apply
Can’t fail the mcat if you don’t take it
Wait I just realized 100IQ isn't that much is it
ok yeet study time
Oh 😬
Thwing Tuesday is when they introduce a different school organization each week
It was moved online last semester it was like kahoots and prizes
how does one access a 2.5x2.5x3 ft secret room? Seems weird
but yeah I need something to put there
holy shit
IM BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A RAP GOD
sorry gater
sorry eminem
THERES VOMIT ON HIS SWEATER ALREADY
Goodbye
BUT HE KEEPS ON FORGETTING
THE WHOLE CROWN GOES SO LOUD
Don’t have it sorry :(
Oh cmon
BUT THE WORDS WONT COME OUT
Also I don't know no gater
Quit the Eminem crap
oh shit
Fuck is that gated

I smell cap though
we bullied him/her into leaving

@Deleted User it's been 9 months

Howdy be fuming cause we’re not in #bruh-chain
you need to do that
i didnt say anthing daddy
Stupid bot
Bad bot
Fuck u
Fuck bots !
Im communist blood
wtf
Fuck automod
it feels like we raiding our own server
If you invade a country for oil but don’t announce the raid in a discord server 

Does it even count?
it doesnt
If a tree falls all alone in the woods does it make a sound
If Ray rice knocks his wife out in an elevator but no camera records it 

Did it even happen?
anjali pls dont cut trees. its not good for the environment
If I kill a person and wipe off the knife did I really kill someone
Some of y’all need your acceptances rescinded
Oh that bob
Someone woke up and chose violence today
I’m Hindu so I’ll never choose violence❤️
clearly you dont know shit about Hinduism so can you stfu?
youre so stupid
I’m sorry what did you get in that one class?
HE HASNT EVEN MET ME IRL
Raunak u just gonna let her call u stupid
No I won’t cheat like Dream did
He’s called me worse things I could care less
So you let him call you worse things without fighting back??
ive decided not to deal with toxic people in my life anymore
It never is
I’m sorry the only thing toxic in your life is the air you breathe
I ONLY CALLED OUT THE AIR
Air pollution go cough cough
As far as I’m concerned you still follow me on insta and we’re still friends on discord so idk what your version of “rEmOvInG tOxIcItY fRoM mY lIfE” is
I ain’t seen an as whooping like this since Clemson-OSU
Damn Raunak took an ass whooping in a roast battle then unfollowed her socials because he got beat so bad 

This is the most down bad I ever seen
In this school, there is sometimes a culture of people applying to undergrad, getting in, and within weeks hours they are already stressed about a perfect med/grad school GPA and mcat scores. If that's your thing, it's not my place to judge, but I promise you that at the very least you won't have fun and that you will have very high chances of burnout by the middle of sem1.

With that being said, remember to go make friends. Go outside. Make sure to drink water, too, cause someone on my floor didn't and ended up in the hospital within his first few weeks of college. You will also find, if you try hard enough through networking and reaching out to others, that being collaborative  and will get you so much farther here, no matter what your major is (both socially and academically). It's 100% possible, and I recommend it. Just please don't stress about med school right now, it contribues to the culture of said toxicity and won't be worth it. Thanks ❤️
Lol if IM toxic in raunak’s life think about how many awful people he’s surrounded by
"I’m sorry what did you get in that one class?" i think texts like this should not be sent
couldnt tell if that was a joke or not lol
If you talk shit but can’t time it back don’t talk shit lol
I would never rub that in someone’s face as a joke
Grades are grades they don’t define you
shit we need to listen to WAP after this heated discussion
What on earth is wrong with you
I don’t speak Japanese
I don’t know what that mf saying but it goes brazy
It’s so fucking stupid it’s good
I'm joking I don't know the singer
I’m civil it’s raunak that’ll beat the crap out of me one day
Yes rip indira Ghandi
Gandhi highkey was a piece of shit
I will accept an apology though for him starting this mess
Holy crap
While nickie was still a babi on Disney channel
LMFAO DEAD
I know, that’s why I don’t tape up my webcam 😉
I feel like I have to clarify that I’m kidding
someone is very annoying 🤡
my bad
u guys are leaving me alone?
the section it says tho :kitty_slam:
boosts gone
She’s doesn’t have nitro anymore
Holy crap drew just answered my email I sent on November 12th
We lost half of our emotes cause jenin doesn’t have nitro anymore
Cause we don’t have the emotes anymore
Not anymore
I wonder if these were the responses barbara Snyder got while she tried to bring in donations
i only emailed drew once in my lifetime and he replied weeks later (today) but thankfully it wasn't an urgent matter so
I just went into office hours
i went to office hours more frequently toward the end of the semester
He legit didn’t
At least when I was there he didn’t
Ugh drew
how stupid are you
So idk why he
drew will be getting frequent visits from me during office hours
sorry drew but i don't want to suffer
And that’s scary
I WAS ALONE WITH HIM ONCE TOO BUT THANKFULLY HIS CAMERA WAS OFF
if you're alone
Cant talk
you need weed first adam
cuz
@anjalir519 pls leave the #quotes channel
u leave i will never stop
but you dont have a room either
so case doesnt care about u
since they cant get housing money from u
But I don’t think they sent out the registration form
Sigh
i haven't but im taking it this upcoming semester. i got some insight about the class from rate my professor
safely tho i assume? :)
there may be one for fall 2020 but idk
idk how to find it tho
cuz idk any freshmen that skipped 214
I’m gonna check but I am away from my computer currently
Yeahh idk if it’s possible?
idk tho
I don’t think the AP credit covered it
i think just check cwru's ap credit policy but i could be remembering things wrong
oh really? then that must be it
but ap won't cover 214 if you're a pre med or a bio/neuro/biochem major
You can't skip 214; AP doesn't give you 214 it gets you 200-TR
what is 200-TR tho?
They just give you 3 credits for taking the AP credit but it doesn't really go for anything
Oh what the
and then if you click the “charges due” does it say “no fin aid pending”
you should be a theatre major with that eye for drama
I hate the cool down in quotes
hey I didn't put it in quotes
That’s lowkey exactly what happened with me and Raunak
Huh what happened with you and me?
i found this, idk how legit it is
Oh boy you’ve missed out on a lot here
Jenin wtf??
Do you want my direct deposit or paypal @kaori_flute
Everytime jenin says “hmmmmmm”, “oh lala” or “noooooo” she has to gimme $1
i like carrots tho 😭
Wtf
Not anymore
It’s too early for this shit
Too late
idk how did they
Anjali never jokes though
She was being serious
Oh hell nah
Plz don’t make me gouge my mf eyes out
I’m clean
changing subjects
never be a mod 🤡
im not horny though
OH F

lemme find a smaller gif and have it as an emote
I can’t believe I found the exact gif
You don’t know who the Lorax is smh
Sorry to offend your dads
clifford has been working out
I feel like there's always at least one indian uncle that goes on philosophical discourses @anjalir519
It’s ok don’t deny it
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LikelyUnitedFanworms-mobile.mp4 the closest i could find
@anjalir519 fr fr... my dad do be that uncle tho
"you know.... everything that I have done is by the grace of god. god alone is my saviour."
HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND THAT
this wasn't cursed lol
@anjalir519 then there's the one in a nautica shirt that needs to brag about his kids
this is on my phone
"my son does debate, robotics, research, also studying at iit"
nope it was sent in a gc a while ago
Yeah my b they just studying for 18hoirs
If that’s you in the future I will cry
Ugh
apparently there's a credits to hours conversion, 23 creds = 67 hours
so 18 hours
damn
Lemme guess she was chill with it?
meanwhile i'm trying to get my brother to talk to me
He won’t leave without telling both of us goodnight and I love you
Damn KKKelly Loeffler lost

Hate 2 C it
THE BITCH IS GONNA BE GONE?
He won’t go to sleep without telling both of us goodnight and I love you

It’s never too late
I do not have the capacity anymore to do that
I’m messing up my sleep schedule for j term
Yea shit
Shit
I DIDNT SEE ALL OF IT
Oh sorry cup pong yes
I MISSED IT AS WELL
no you don't
That’s not bad
That’s why you don’t use iMessage. You need to have to option to delete
Both parties can delete though
i laughed so hard ~~was it today or yesterday~~
Just how slow are you oml
If anyone wants to chill in vc while I work lmk
OH U EVEN SENT IT TWICE?

I need to stay focused so
My wifi isn’t working
RIP vc

Not even kidding the wifi is working now
@everyone who wants to play jackbox?
Oh lala
I realized something sad
Babs wont sign any of ours diplomas
Noooooo our degrees won’t be validated now😭
Only Babs can do that but she’s gone now🥺
wtf did I wake up to, this is literally an attempted coup
@absence000 CAMERON THIS IS YOUR MOTHER YOU NEED TO WAKE UP AT 9 AM NOW YOU HAVE J-TERM IN 2 DAYS
What the fuck is happening
I didn’t understand that lol
I’m just disappointed that these people let themselves be used like this
All of a sudden Blue Lives don’t matter anymore to them👀
saying “oh we would never”
Either MAGA freaks got shot or police get shot I cannot lose
I just want the violence to stahppppp
I personally don’t want anyone shot, I want people arrested
Although protesting won’t change the election results
Your people are attempting a coup

Don’t talk to me
Imagine if BLM protestors even tried to storm Congress, let alone actually forced their way in
Oh that would’ve ended in a massacre
Imagine if BLM didn't murder people while protesting.
Don’t let facts hurt his feelings
Why does edible cookie dough not hit as hard as raw cookie dough?
i wish i had talent
i wish i had a brain
you're not alone
leave me alone
when you have to work twice or even three times as hard as some of your genius peers at this school 🤡
alright sad talk over
I don't got the work ethic for that
I’m trying to be
what if you've tried
so hard
As I said, you need to change your perspective on what you think brings you happiness
then u doin it wrong
Cause he/she also had some weeb shit in his profile pic
even tho it may not be correct per se
oh i have
i should get back to psych in which i wanted to get ahead in
my psych j term class
so you gotta learn a whole class in 3 weeks?
? i don't understand the point
but my class doesn't have any tests
Whenever my motivation to study ebbs, I remind myself of the consequences of not studying and then my motivation returns 🥲
3 weeks sounds way too short to get any meaningful learning in
I'm taking Calculus III in January because it's a requirement for me that isn't as important as Linear Algebra or Discrete Math for my major
calculus III in a month sounds like pain to me
accounting major can't relate
damn spare some of your work ethic and brain power and bless me with it
I haven't been as successful as @_frostyyyyy_ has
My motivation is that everybody I know expects me to get As and I don't want to disappoint them
Looks like ill be spending longer nights
I don't use Snapchat, what does that signify?
i already have sadly
im hungry
hi hungry, im howdy
Hi hungry I’m Raunak
*but little did they know, that they won't meet for another 8 months at the earliest*
Howdy won’t meet you
cant meet a ghost
Can I have all your money now?
what money
Cause you won’t need it
won't do much tho
i don't have anything that would interest you tbf
I could see your iPhone 👀
it's nearly 5 years old. it aint worth much now
Someone already posted that in memes
Oh yall will need to show me around campus
Idk when that will be
oh lala
@anjalir519 LMAO we haven't even applied as OLs yet
People could show me a million times and I am still very much directionally challenged
@nobelium19 let's do some crap this spring and go to east cleveland
damn
I told myself the same thing but didn't go at all
I miss it
So due to some shifting in positions, juniper and Mistletoe RAs will be working together
they showed up in their big SUVs, get out, told the people to stop, and drive away
I mean no offense but with the LinkedIn assessment thing I wasn’t wrong
speaking of rip pogchamp
I work in a nursing home
You will be able to *smell* parties from a mile away without a mask
zhanda pls dont ping horny jail
i have a feeling you will
yea ik. he might still ping tho
ugh thats not datable
"ole miss" is also datable
we need to find the college in the center
"whitman" is a college in WA
holy shit its 1am lmao
sorry i was busy during the summer
adam i told you he'll be back
ive seen ron... twice. Even though we live next to each other
ope sorry ron
i've never actually seen ron :eyes2:
I've never seen howdy
i've never seen ron either
i've never seen or heard howdy either
miss u :NM_PensiveClown:
oh sorry guo, i thought clown gang was only zhanda and gater
sorry im ugly
the old server is dead
Damn I feel like Jenin
Smh ohio doesnt have to quarentine despite being at 18%... Double standard alert
Do you eat cereal with cold milk or hot serious question everyone
I mean arriving on campus, which you can kind of assume to be a bubble, someone from nevada which is at 16% will have to quarantine, but someone from ohio won't. The person from ohio will be most likely to test positive. I'm half joking here.
Texas needs to get their shit together
just come 2 weeks early 🤡
he needs to get tf over here
why didn't howdy smash that like
howdy doesnt pee
oh sorry
I wish I had not read these messages
i wish i didn't learn to read
Oh :cursed_flushed:
Arriving in cleveland in 7-12 months
anyone in cleveland, who wants to go downtown tomorrow
lmao nothing i didn't know already
so apparently Palestinians can't get vaccines so far
no i wish :cri:
oh boy don't remind us
I joined but didn’t say anything lol
Idk tbh
oh no what a travesty
but spartan bot isnt the one that censors
Oh I thought it was
nope, its automoderator
@mgster we miss you
Shit would hit the fan
oh
Mistletoe lost our RCD so Antonio is going to be our RCD for the forseeable future
~~I want to watch zach pull up to the parties that happen when someone on the floor below us tests positive~~
oh yeahhh
I don't know
We lost our RCD
college football?
Only lost 1 game since I've been here
and I don't know why its on discord
Damn send case up against Ohio State
The Natty is on monday
and I have to WORK
if u dont do the work u wont get the vax
And I want that vax
i thought students aint getting it
A lot of people in my family have gotten the vaccine and I'm really tired of isolating and worrying
damn, i dont know anyone who got the vaccine
yeah you deserve it if you were working for the nursing home
Also, I do an 8 hour shift in a kitchen wearing a mask and it doesn't bother me at all, so people who say they can't breath in it are lying
except then I had to puree meatballs
No I don't believe so
I never said shit hole anything
Raunak and I do not need couples therapy I can’t steal someone’s man like that
Yeah I know but I didn’t want to have it there permanent
logs are permanant though
umm wtf
So what did I miss lol
tbh idk either
Idk man
No it didn’t
She can’t
I didn’t
if cleveland goes to the superbowl, we're all getting sent home
Suck my fucking dick
@kenobiow how does that work
and for the record you need a cattle prod to stop horniness, not a mallet
Sorry adam
Bruh I left for like 2 weeks (okay maybe 3) and I already forgot my account password
is the move in date selection open yet?
I have a question for people who have changed their passphrase because of the security changes: what does this sentence mean on the passphrase changing website?
Before starting this process, be sure to either be on the CWRU network, or using VPN. If not, you'll need to log on to your computer using the CWRU network the first time after changing your passphrase.

Does that mean that I won't be able to log in if I'm not using their VPN?
bruh ur tellin me i cant change my password in my apartment
does that mean u cant access canvas or something if ur not connected to the wifi or vpn
oh
so it doesnt even apply to me
Once u change your password you’ll have to log back into canvas but you don’t need case wifi for that
how'd you guess?
no need to guess
ugh
I'm surprised at the degree of security that CWRU wants. Two-factor authentication and passphrases that take centuries to crack via brute force? I doubt that most people have that type of security on anything, even financial accounts
i guess cwru doesn't want our accounts to be hacked
he was in his office one day
2 FBI people and the dean came inside
apparently his work computer got hacked
they took it with them
and he now receives emails about what happened with that hacker in court or something
because he's a victim
this actually happened?
we need to pay attention to basic steps :crittyslam:
It's a cold, cold world...
Still kinda surprised parents are allowed in the building, or maybe I'm just salty because my parents aren't coming
Like, it's such an unnecessary risk. Students should also know how to set up their flat screen TVs and refrigerators without any help, too.
I also got a nice engineering laptop for college, why need a TV when I have that?
i'm more salty about the damn rent
Idk I thought that was technically shut down but idk
save even more money by never eating
Steady snacking with granola bars juice and making meals every once in a while really works, during exams I bottled a lot of granola and "drink" from it while studying, saves a lot of time
I like being home but I'm at the point where I miss Cleveland and I want to go back
Imagine having lived in Cleveland enough that you miss it
Couldn’t be me
Ope it won’t let me in because “I’m not enrolled”
Wouldn’t hurt to call and ask
The email said for all students tho on and off campus rip
i suppose if it’s big money grant u don’t wanna risk it
College :vibe:
This works out actually I didn’t wanna write the essay
Bruh the email said both on and off campus tho
bruh, it won't let me log in
SMH I didn’t do the reorientation training when I wasn’t going on campus last sem
it won't let me log in ughhhhh
I didn’t try but someone did
Idk
I’m not doing that shit again
okay so I'm not alone
I don't remember doing an orientation last summer
Days of exams
> We're sorry, access is not allowed because you are not enrolled. Please contact your organization's IT help desk for assistance.
idk who to ask about it because the email is a do not reply temp email for some fucking reason
Oh no does that fix that
Oh I thought he was off-campus sorry
@sprinkles2108 did you find a solution
No I didn’t look for one yet
@nobelium19 Dr. Nobel, will I die if I eat chinese sausages raw
And once again I'm lost
How and why are you awake at 6 AM? Do you wake up very early or go to sleep very late?
woke up late i think
First exam of the year in t-5hours
Getting an A on this first exam is critical for me because the second and third exams are going to be a lot more difficult
Y’all have exams in your j term classes?
I have 4 exams
Two of those exams are in the last three days of the course too
Oh my
I could never
Honestly, I doubt it. I can barely stay focused enough for my psych class
Yeah, I’m taking 22 credits this semester but plan on taking 15 in the fall when/if I go to campus to have a smoother transition into college life
I think your hardest semester will be this current one because of the credit hours
I not only have 4 exams but also a lot of homework
The homework is a grade booster tbh
just too bad that melt's closed...
Thats sick!
Bruh it doesn't cost money tho
if nobel buys the den
we don't even have to pay through the swipes
@kaori_flute because I didn’t wanna eat college food
not last semester
idk about this semester tho
but it was a regular swipe last semester
it's torture without the den
i don't wanna walk just to get den
fuck
forgot there's nothing good on south
pretty damn far
Damn
not really it’s doable but
Screw work I’m going for a walk
I just went outside
That’s cold
it has constantly been -1 C these past 2 weeks
It starts to get near freezing end of August
It got hot then cold
oh yeah
a whole week of warmth
and then 2 days where it's like 15 C
but it's not that bad
at least this year
it started getting cold in late September
sad times
ugh
I’m sorry for u
I didn’t get the heat genes
Just a good type of cold
ahh i feel you
that was me b4 getting used to the weather here 🤡
How did you get used to the weather?
THE WEATHER IS SO BOOTIFUL OUTSIDE
Yet I'm getting pressure from my folks to apply for early decision which is binding and I don't seek to go through a process of withdrawing through that
If you don’t have an interest of attending a college, pls don’t ED there
I think it's a great school, but I don't personally feel it's the right one for me. My parents want me to attend there, and I feel if I go with them it'll pay off
Nope, if you don't vibe with it don't ED. It should be your personal choice, not your parent's
It's been stressing me out, my dad and I don't speak as much or when we have a conversation about uni it gets argumentative
What school so you want to attend
Yes I'm American. My goal is to become a psychiatrist, but I do not want to study in the US due to a variety of reasons
I also do not wish to practice here also
Then don't study at case lol
Exactly, but my folks are saying "I'll regret it" or "millions of asians try to come here, but yet you don't"
Damn
My background is Romanian + it's the cheapest country within the EU to study medicine. I plan to move to Germany or the UK after graduating.
Germany is extremely hard to get licensed in
@toomanyzs Unless you're within the EU and know B2 or higher German it's not too bad
Why not attend an American university and participate in a study abroad
There's no way in hell I'm paying half-a-mil for uni
I'm C1 and it would still be difficult for me as an American citizen. I think countries which are in desperate need of mental health care but are still EU that would be easy to both get licensed in and make an impact are like Bulgaria, Czechia, Ukraine, Latvia
@deadaccount5250 don’t fall prey to @raunakwastaken he’s international
Should I be worried?
They're well to do and all and had a fund since I was young that was non-taxed. I'm just told if I apply and get in, everything will be ok
I don't know how I should take this as
I mean it definitely seems like you are very motivated and you know what you want to do, so props to you. Us here at case (I think) have all had pretty positive experiences, and could talk about them for days. But if it's not a vibe here for you, don't come. If you are struggling to convince your parents otherwise, try finding a friend in college who was unhappy because their parents took too much control of their lives, show them to your parents, and prove that the risk with doing something less conventional is OK.
Can a 2.9 GPA do though?
it really depends
Idk I’m international we don’t have GPA
I go to a stem school
I didn't play many sports or apart of many clubs
and by many, none since freshmen year
Oh yeah, don't they now have an additional essay you have to write?
I can dm you if you want
Cause we’re not posting it publicly afaik
She thinks since it's close to home my folks can help me alot better with my education
Also, college is all about learning to advocate for yourself. If your parents think they have to intervene a bunch to support you, that's wrong in my opinion.
Hate to break it to her but you won’t get a chance to get your parents involved in your schoolwork
Given the format of college
Someone explain what this person just said?
OH
If they get grades below their standard, their parents won't pay
Oh
Oh gotcha
but they want you to only get a's in exchange for paying?
It sucks sometimes
I don’t mean to butt in, but that’s toxic
if they just want to see your grades i dont think theres a problem with that, if they want you to have a specific gpa in exchange for paying thats a no
It is due in 7 hours
It’s due tomorrow at 11:59 pm
It exists here tho
i think if u go to school in the US it will apply to u
I really don't want to study here, but I actually have considered Alaska
Alaska's got a lot of drug problems
It sounds to me like the guy/gal/NB pal wants to just be left the hell alone for 4 years
It's not my parents particularly. I just find myself disillusioned about living in the US
ohio has a lot of drug problems???????????????????????????
At one point it was due to my folks, but overtime living in the US became the major reason for leaving. I can only really tolerate Alaska, or Hawaii at this point tbh. Possibly NYC as well
Yes, but Alaska doesn't really have a cohesiveness to it, and the rates of mental health issues, self harm, and poverty are very high. Their infrastructure is also very poor.
Getting away from controlling parents?
No some elect to study internationally
@deadaccount5250 I think you can apply to case even after the deadline. Last year I applied like 10 days after the RD deadline
Ummm if you think the government here is controlling I’ve got bad news for you in other countries
Though idk much about New Zealand
mind you, I'm a leftist. What I mean by gov't is that it's becoming too authoritarian and not helping working class folks
I lean left too but honestly that was just the president this past term
moving on!
Healthcare is a right take it or leave it
I wish, but it'll be along while before that'll happen
The capitalists won't accept it until it's profitable on their part
Hell, even Hawaii is doing it now
I just hope that the quality of healthcare won’t go down when we switch to universal healthcare.
Should I be aware of how potentially moving 9000 miles away to the other half of the planet might affect me emotionally. I handle things quite well, but I'm worried about missing out here at home.
I almost applied to a school in the UK
And then realized it would be a bit too far from home
I missed the deadline for medicine students
Because they contacted me too late
Us Indian-Americans will help you feel at home😃👍
Can’t feel homesick when you’re already at home🦦😎
Vermont tried universal healthcare (single-payer) and then got rid of it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform
I’ve keep myself away from figurines with the false belief that I don’t have the space
the ones that dont have pool or foosball :)
I don't think there's any way to tell except to ask students from that house; I can't find any information about it online, but what Howdy said was correct, typically they have on or the other
I believe Sherman House has a pool table but correct me if I'm wrong
iirc i think either taft or taplin has a table too? can't remember which one. it's also possible that neither of them have one either and i'm just simply lost
I’m jealous of those with ping pong
with the covid protocols in place, they probably won't be playing ping pong
@_frostyyyyy_ I think common rooms are close
closed*
@neptune234 LMAOOOOO duo is stupid i agree
@neptune234 rip, so you didn't receive a link in your email?
nope, i spent that entire meeting trying to deal with duo
And I spent 40 min trying to find another way to get to that page and coudnt do it:/
3 labs tho
And yet
That’s another class
One of the labs is online tho
I don't quite know
Aw yayy
Nope, apparently that character is literally only ever used to refer to the element Nobelium
Yeah 锘 is apparently "Nobelium"
Idk by the sugar lol
@sprinkles2108 Are you able to access the reorientation now?
Have not tried yet. You?
I can't access it but UTech gave me access to a Canvas course instead that has the same content
Oh yeah all people who were originally staying home should get duo setup before arriving on campus. It's needed for access to your dorm room if you left your key inside.
it just occurred to me that i don't have duo 🤡
Don’t get campusgroups cause it’s a poopy app
Grub hub is a must have app if you don't want to be eating leutner all the time
but sometimes people leave their stuff in the dryer for hours after it's done
I mean either way someone is still gonna fuck up the laundry machines
You need to email people
Wtf
Some idiot tried to wash a crappy pillow
Foam everywhere, it was broken for weeks
why would that happen to a pillow tho
First was like the microwave which never got cleaned
the grossest thing that i saw was when the balcony door was left open on a warm night
a lot of mosquitos got inside
like
***a lot***
Nothing is.more disgusting and inhumane than peeing on the toilet seat
don't u?
RIP
i would see other buildings that have them tho
Given how.old all of the dorms are I wouldnt be surprised if someone feel through the balcony one day
dunno
Oh yikes
it just did not feel right
Couldn’t be us remote peeps
Home issues are worse IMO
Yeah because you have to fix them
Or hire someone to
Embarrassing if you caused the issue though
I low-key prefer home because I don't have to share toilets with 4 other people
lmao i remember when the fire alarm went off
someone did not put enough water in their mac n cheese or sth
Someone was smoking weed in storrs
Damn priyanka throwing shade at on campus people
RIP cutter 307
I was supposed to be in cutter 307 and my roomie and I even settled for juniper
Idk why we wanted Clarke so bad
But I heard lots of bad stuff about it
I haven’t been in any halls yet🤡
don't remember
Have you visited campus though?
don't have moving staircases though
I mean I guess me too
Find out who keeps peeing on the storrs 410-415 quad toilet
I don't know which one that is
for 15 mins
Alien type shit out here
The real idiots were the ones who were swapping 6 packs with each other on Euclid when a cop car was like one block away from them
It is still wild to me that I am allowed to do that
If you have any left over
And damn zach out here declaring prohibition for all of cwru
We do have bathtubs, although there's no source of heat enough to ferment
I haven't ever come across bathroom sex, but I have come across plenty of drunk people who never have clothes on when they pass out
Damn
There's this man in a cleveland neighborhood called Archie, who used to run the Hough bakeries, and he has his own bakery now, and his cakes have the most unique, almondy, smooth taste, with beautiful, delicious icing and I miss those things available in Cle
I really hope you guys in your sophomore year go out into the city and the neighborhoods and find those spots, history, walking trails, fun areas,  monuments, museums, and everything else that I got to do. It'll really make you see how much Cle has to offer
I miss the hell out of just walking to Shaker Square and enjoying the old, grand houses in Fairmount
Going to Cavs games for 13 bucks cuz they suck, and just eating popcorn and messing around
People just don't try hard to find those things
but yes, the soap made at the P&G plant probably tastes bad
I don't get that reference but yes
UTech told me that I need to begin using Duo to start the reorientation 🤡
bruh i forgot about the reorientation
you need it for most things
it's due on sunday
I have to go to work Saturday and Sunday
I somehow made it this far without using it
hey zach sorry for stalking your hometown but why is your high school mascot the spartan? It feels like they stole it from Case, who stole it from MSU
no its the lima oh mascot
WTF
our logo is just trying too hard yk
I was making a covid snowstorm but it was gonna kill my laptop
Lima senior is pain
and now that we don't have nitro it won't work
We also ran out of servr nitro
I went to Shawnee
We lost our nitro?
damn that's some rural ohio type shit
The sad thing is that it's by far the best school in this area
i want to make an inner city school where the mascot is an amish guy, and teach rural ohio a lesson
There's only one other school who has produced an ivy leaguer in my area
how far from the case campus do i need to drive to find corn?
Probably 45 mins
You know what. I drive past that sign every day I go to work
I'll leave early tomorrow and take a picture with it
What happens if I don't finish this reorientation by 1/17 11:59 PM?
I wouldn't want to find out
I mean someone told me that she didn’t do it last sem and nothing happened
But still I wouldn’t take a chance
I saw some people on WhatsApp that didn't do Diversity360 orientation last semester and now CWRU is asking them to to do it now 🤡
Yeah that shit is low-key hard asf
Which also goes hard :/
Oh it’s like a fast food joint
Anyone else with very slow canvas?
Idk
They didn’t have food though
Aw man
I had the worst smoothie ever today
Never EVER get a coffee smoothie
Ever broader, don’t go to some stupid FiTnEsS food place
still sus IMO
I’m sorry but you need to see a therapist
God I missed Indian food so much when I got home
oh shit i agreed with ronak
Oh shit what will happen now jenEeen?
I had it 3 weeks ago bud
It was a stupid text
I do be tired
For such a stupid text
You never know when I'm lurking
you never know
Howdy only needs one screen and the banhammer
i think im gonna need zach's paycheck then :P
I just didn’t read my emails from the hospital I volunteered at🤡
Apparently not everyone was able to schedule because of some logistical issues
So I guess I’m not missing out
I hope I can come this fall so I can begin volunteering at Cle Clinic because like idk where my current uniform and badge are🤡
My setup is... A plastic table, a USB mouse, a fire extinguisher, a pretty good laptop, and a whole lotta random shit
in case the laptop catches fire
that's sick
This is where I do most of my work
what projects are you working on rn?
The lightbox has an arduino in it cause I was demoing something for a club, I also had to fix my 3d printer recently (which is why the tools are everywhere) and ive been doing some laser art
Ever since I've stopped writing on paper I've freed up too much space
Yoo is the bio 215 lab only 6 weeks long???
i'm confused
don't ED2 people submit on Jan 15th?
No matter the due date
yeah but
they are receiving decisions
and this obviously does not happen overnight
that is why im confused
You submit early?
I thought that’s mostly schools with Rolling Admissions though
Yeah idek college admissions? Never again
What the fuck
“Our days” dude we applied last school year lol
Except the optional one if you were deferred or didn’t get an interview for PPSP
I don’t even know
Do you ever wish someone would just tell you where you’d end up
i could have focused more in studying
Oh
I'm bored in the chat I'm in the chat bored
You guys don't have me on snap bc you're children and I have a private life but this was a monumental decision somebody made at the store
Did you get the tortillas though
And zachs hometown is racist so I don't want to dox it either
since it is all ohio
Frat-wise, a frat where alcohol isn’t allowed
nope, I got exiled after refusing to take off my bike shorts in a business setting ❤️
idk at this point I've lost track of all the posts I've Zhanda'd
i've never been to rural texas
Eh sure fair I guess but it’s considered southern
naw zhanda aint florida man
one of the owners of the server doesn't even go to case 🤔
Oh
I don't know
Oh it's
do i die now
tight end for the denver broncos
what happened
oh sorry
why is that bad
@scottywalker14 sorry that was me, I thought you were shannon
I am, sadly, not Shannon 😔
nope, it must stay a secret finn
Aww
oh yeah if anyone else wants to be invited to the tendies run plz lmk
i dont eat animals 😦
oh
@chandachan fr tho why do u delete so many messages you send
Sorry
the fuck?
THe internet is a wild place
@chandachan have u downloaded dota yet
Sorry Finn, in all seriousness, I have 2 exams and a final exam within the span of 2 weeks for the calc j-term
shit howdy is online
@chandachan wont u have more work during the semester?
@howdy_. what happened there
zhanda said i wasnt online
i cant do it cause im not mod
why would u need a bot for that
for a sec i thought u were threatening me with a ban cause i threatened violence or smt
:XMARK6: **Zhandaya**, you can't use that.
guess not
:XMARK6: **Finn Owsley**, you can't use that.
wtf
:XMARK6: **Zhandaya**, you can't use that.
:XMARK6: **Finn Owsley**, you can't use that.
:XMARK6: **zaxh**, you can't use that.
:XMARK6: **zaxh**, you can't use that.
```zaxh``` is the imposter but still
oh smart
im changing back to fim cause if everyone else is anonymous then so am i
:XMARK6: **Fim**, you can't use that.
dw finn if you want you can have @Souper Cewl Dood
no i dont but howdy does
what do u need
or do i need to make it
no, i think you need to make it
Sorry in advance if that troubles you\
i made this server last year
@howdy_. @wuhoo4158 can i have a zendaya tag please sorry for tagging you
@chandachan i will kill you
So when i do pull up oyu will actually lose
dont give @raunakwastaken a mod role, he's evil
Oh looks like Nobel forgot an elif
it checks for @everyone, if message contains that @everyone it won't go on to check for the cameron ping
i need to sleep
i mean its reacting with different emojis so idk
I probably fucked it up but there's a chance I fixed that bug
YOOOOO we need a tendies run tag
True, I also have no time to game during the January session since I'm taking the same math class
I just found out today that there's an advanced Calc 3: MATH 227 💀
My professor told me that she wished I was able to take that one instead and that it focused more on proofs
I'm not sure yet but I probably might end up doing it or at least taking a proficiency exam for "fun"
Do med schools want to see applicants take math in college even if they already have some calculus credit from high school?
No but you mentioned before MATH223 is a prereq for AI
Idk if that was a good or bad idea🤡
Now idk if I should take Calc 3 for the heck of it🤡
I wouldn't be taking Calc 3 if it wasn't for a prerequisite and I don't think you should suffer through it just to "challenge yourself"
I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re a math major cause honors classes don’t actually add more value to your degree
Unless you just like doing advanced math lol
doesn't it have more weight on GPA?
is it 3 credit hours or 4 hours?
I think both of them are 3 credit hours
then yeah, i don't see a reason unless you like it
they do credit hours x grade you got in gpa points
if i had a 4 credit class and got an A
damn
i could be wrong abt that im no math major
no they dont lol
oh its grade points earned based on the credits from a class and the grade divided by total credit hours
actually i wont
i took a 5 credit class last semester
what class?
worst class ever lmao
i mean for soph sem 1 in our regular curriculum if u get a B in medsurg ur gpa for that sem cant go above like a 3.6
depends how good u are at math
even though it's so fucking stupid
lol sorry nobel
We should add the scary emoji for adam
ok i think we need to add spartan bot to the scary emoji server then
damn it's the four forces of nature
I just realized that I'm disobeying Rule 9 ope
Howdy gets thonk or drybones 
Not ping pong cuz howdy himself has to do it
Sleep for the week x)
@_frostyyyyy_ sorry for the ping, just tryna see something
Oh what
You don't ever need to be sorry about pinging me
Can I get a clown emoji though
Don't you dare, I'll reject that PR
He needs the brain emoji just saying
if you want to do it modify the code
Idk how to program it though lol
Bruh isn't NOBEL enough
If you don't know how to code, you can still submit an issue and one of us can work on it
Anyone who is BME is not a sane person, sorry to out you all
HOLD ON I WAS LOOKING FOR WHAT EMOJI I WANTED
You really want me to add that?
I was trying to find different emojis
Lemme find an easier one for u lol I don’t wanna make it difficult
sometimes what they do to get there is... morally questionable though
Please state the reason why you want it and how it makes sense
Also I cannot do the NAE NAE and so I want to do it digitally at least
If you do it I'll accept it but I really need to get back to studying
Yes, it's very hard to find a job in the industry immediately with just a bse given that BME is a niche major and that other engineers (I.e., mechEs) can easily fulfill some roles in our position
Do you have a specific type of engineering job that you want after you graduate?
but nobel is studying rn so he has to approve it
No he doesn’t❤️
if nobel doesn't approve it, the thing won't work
yeah im working on it
Raunak hates his guts
can someone make him an emote
Oh you can just spell out nehru
@addat I’ve always wanted to ask you the story behind the word “adat”
i spelled my name wrong in fifth grade
Nope nobel wouldnt let me add in code for that he thought it was too scary
cuz the emote has "adam" on it
Yeah 🧯 is much less controversial unfortunately
*unfortunately*
Oh
Its called reoritentation cause you redo it
Except I know a few people who seriously need to watch this
The number of people who don’t wash their hands is so concerning and gross
For those of us who already knew about handwashing, masks, and social distancing, the reorientation isn't too helpful
The only reorientation I want is the one for first-year students in the fall
If I can’t come this fall, I’ll be pretty sad
I thought we still needed to wear a mask and socially distance even with the vaccine
Oh
antivaxxers rn arent actually enough to make herd immunity not happen
what happened
Idk
I saw general was highlighted and then I see nothing here
I don’t know
he does that alot idk why but its rly annoying
I hope that happens. Can’t be stuck at home forever now huh
And not everything lasts forever
A study I read said that people who have had covid can still spread, but people who are vaccinated don't spread
Prior covid infection is 83% effective at prevention for 5 months
trust me everyone keeps doing it, if it's for the gram masks and social distancing don't matter
wow scientific studies and my bad sense of sarcasm really don't mix well
Employees and students prolly decided rules aren't a thing
Fucked up as in bad, not incorrect
Exactly, and there are some that are extremely bad about masking
didn't they do better at taking the daily covid assessment, however?
I proposed that your door doesn't unlock until you complete the covid screen
And also darts full of sevofluorane that sedate you if the cameras see you in the hallway without a mask
That didn't go over well
bro you don't need a covid mallet, you need a covid tranq gun
I'd hoped people forgot about that
Working in nursing home makes you smell like overdone hamburgers and jello cubes
zach, gotta do this the lazy way, sorry
"I never liked that near as much as the simple beauty of poggers"
-zach
I feel like that was more work in the long run
yeah if anyone else wants to be invited to the tendies run lmk
PST more like PP stupid time
I'm sorry my time zone isn't elitist enough for you howdy
Zach I don't speak cringe can you please say that in english?
Can you send the scary emoji
oh you missed a lot
What happened?
Oh
i think there is still some bugs
adam, u gotta make another pull request to bug fix :P
what do you want to PR? They've gotten shot down before
what the fuck
unless you're removing the emojis to fuck with me
maybe have someone who isnt raunak try it
i thought part of that code was taken out?
oh cause ur on mobile
Does raunak have an emote yet
even though nobel hates #cursed-memes🤣
Bye 👋
Bye!
bye 👋
Bye bye
bye ✋
Bye 👋
BRO I FORGOT TO DO THE ORIENTATION
uh oh
uh oh
I don't think you will be penalized
Yes goodbye
I tried to fit too.many lollipops in my mouth
Bye!
Howdy stop being such a mod omg
doesnt raunak beg for power every 5 seconds
Yes because he broke the first rule multiple times
Rules are meant to be broken
i want to show my plants i made
the real life mod vs the internet mod
as expected they didn't do shit but it was fun
12:20 am is actually too early for anything to happen
you need a stroll around 3
he has yet to reply
i dont even want to google maps this
for trying to moderate the streets
"sir you are muted for an hour, let me find my duct tape"
One time I ordered PaPa John's pizza, in my freshman year, right at the beginning of spring break. It was about 12:10 am, and when the pizza guy got there, he got out of the car to get around to the passenger side to get the pizza out, and he kinda tripped on the curb and then a FUCKING GLOCK FELL OUT OF HIS PANTS. 
I looked at it, he looked at it, and then he said 
"Man you know in this crazy ass town, I gotta keep that MF strap on me, 100."
And then tucked it back in his waistband and hopped back in the car
Damn he sent an essay
he has a bowl cut
*yet*
WTF
car, cash, and food
axe throwing far away seems fun, the small ranges where the axe bounces back tho :cursed_flushed:
how else do you think trees havent been cut down round campus
honestly zach would be a good surgoen. He can throw/catch axes with precision, knows how to gut a fish, and has yet to kill a single old person
*yet*
:XMARK6: **zaxh**, you can't use that.
I cant do that but if I live stream the view from my window you can see his room
Deans list type shit
me doing the reorientation with one hour left to spare
I don't think it actually took an hour like they said it would, I think it was around 30 minutes
damn
yeah and i dont have discord servers with my mom in them
oh
i didnt even watch the videos
i dont intend to break any important rules
i dont want any RAs knowing
i guess im just scared because i know RAs have the legal authority to execute students
Like last year some kids his another kids laptop in the ceiling, and rather than write a report, I handed him a broomstick and told him to look for the heavy tile
And whichever tile is the heaviest is either the laptop or a very pissed off rat mother
As long as there's no bear mace
Hate those too
I do accept sacrifices of chef boyardee though
Piss orbeez I also don't like those
You're not allowed in any building or room you don't live in right now
isnt that only till february?
I managed to have no positive tests in my entire building last sem
isnt that only till february?
oh
But I don't want people getting sick, because the volatile nature of the disease means somebody could actually die
There was literally 2 slides 2 from the end of orientation that had links to these documents
Fuck covid
we think Howdy doesn't reply with a ping
ok issue closed
Apparently it’s from the Cleveland institute of music but I’m an engineering major
my throat hurts and i have a cough :cozy_blanket:
there was a man at my job a few days ago
i hate people
an agent of death
ill see if im still like this tomorrow
just cuz it could also be allergies
~~and i dont want to scare my parents~~
yeah lol my allergies have flared up over the course of covid so my mom keeps asking if i have it even though im just like sneezing a couple times a day
Yeah but still
@addat what do u want
He still won't ever send me a ❤ emoji
Sarah do you like the fire extinguisher emoji tho
RIP JENIN 1998 - 2021
Just tell them straight away really, it's annoying when that happens, who cares if they get mad
Don't buy/sell them if they don't
i can't do tha 😭
I'd be very careful myself tlak to my boss and still tell them pretty mad to cover his faucet of viruses
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
I could use some firewood, it gets cold in the winter sometimes
My hands aren't big enough to play the cello, trust me I've tried
No he wasn't
So Nobel is missing
Effect and cause
Interestingly, "cause and effect" is an irreversible binomial so you can't reverse the order without changing the meaning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_binomial

Somebody at the nursing home tested positive which is irritating because that means I have to cook for 8 hours in an N95 and a surgical
that sucks
it gets annoying sometimes when i have to go in and out of the freezer
cuz then my glasses get all foggy
sorry it took so long, my previous concept was gonna brick my laptop
but the server isn't boosted so
new york isnt just the city?
sorry :'(
~~why need hot sauce when there's you~~
howdy needs that mapo tofu
tofu nasty tho
Wrong.
who hurt u
I wouldn’t drink as much soy milk tho
Finn was turned white and nobody batted an eye
sorry that i didn't grow up in india as if that were my choice
sorry that i'm multi-tasking culturally
leave us confused children of immigrants alone 😭
same tho
oh shoot air quality sorta went bad in my area
^^in terms of the iphone weather app thingy
probably cuz of the snow
California air during wild fire season is like 200-500. get on our level
@raunakwastaken jealous?
HOLYYYYYYYY BRO YOU GOTTA ESCAPE WTF
500 AQI oh fuck that's bad
that's really bad

no ngl @raunakwastaken you gotta gtfo kolkata wtf
oh damn it's worse than New delhi?

I’m much more worried about my grandma lol
She has breathing problems
If it measures air quality then 500 must be very high quality air 😎
i see no info on air quality but it's so cold there
aw damn i have no birthday scheduled in 2022 this sucks
oh lala
on one of the worst days :kitty_slam:
RIP
my bday is usually during spring break but dunno about college so
or did i get the day wrong
don't hate me i never remember bdays
people remember that because its the day the US dropped a fat one on Hiroshima
apparently if you spent today in kolkata, it would be the equivalent of smoking 25 cigarettes
what?????? and you didn't tell us??
WHY DIDNT YOU SAY SO
Your dog and I are soul mates
in case you missed it :)
I like both weather and steak, however, I do not like 18 year old stay at home denialism
he really does look like he's in pain
didn't mean for it to be funny cuz it's the truth
i dont think you want to
Wtf 💀💀
Jenin they gave you non halal meat tho 👀
seriously
Wtf
God and Mohammed wants to know what you ate at Leutners
Damn
I-
dunno :xCrittyx:
@stuckinohiolads we need to get Dino nuggies
First we need to get dinosaurs
isn't all falafel vegetarian :pikathink:
Really?
Y'all we need to build healthy sleeping schedules 🙂
oh
i say as i’ll get bibibop every time i go out instead tho
I can’t
i won't be directly involved cuz i don't wanna get banned
Maybe the wedding was pushed back due to covid and I'm practicing more as a result? who knows
hmm, I was thinking like saying "theory is the most important thing in all of music, if you don't know any you can't be called a musician at all"
im not mad
ojk now im mad
cause u deleted ur fucking messages
@raunakwastaken does he get mad if you double ping or something
Jenin send the scary emote
oh there he is
looks like raunak wants to catch a bonk
Technically I didn’t break any rule
no u dont
in the last 3 days
I’m bored of it now
don't ask the worst episodes :xCrittyx:
fuck i just realized i dont have hair on one spot on my chin cause i got stitches there when i was like 6 i fell down the stairs and split my chin open
Oh I don’t believe that
They got so pissed lmao
cameron: i need to wake up early tmw
also cameron: talks at 4 am
fuck
this is a "cultured" joke tho
people who don't know music prolly don't even know the viola exists
they will call it a violin if they see it alone :Fire:
He never goes to bed early if he says he will
Theory 2 last sem, plus jazz ensemble and lessons
bruh i just realised i forgot to contact chernofsky :kitty_slam:
Okay go to sleep in 5 mins or your piano breaks
i'm trying to record this piece without getting the 1st page wrong
but
no
that does not work
Transitions are annoying sometimes
yeah
or the lack of air builds up as u go through the piece
Idk most of these, I mainly do jazz
i know it isn't that complicated but it just looks complicated
But rules are meant to be broken
not that clarinets need to make them
i feel like following rules is even harder than breaking them
thanks i really really really tried
The solo section is insane, completely improvised septuplet runs, while playing the bassline with your left hand, all over those insane chords
and sometimes we season the beans cuz we like it _spicy_
ok i found it
i'm cringing at it tho
i forgot which song u shared
i'm cringing at this piece
i can't
Oh you mean your own piece?
ugh so I can't get out of all these classes and stuff?
well it's "required" but idk what they can do to make us go
I mean I'm going since I don't want to find out but still
How is that a requirement? Is that for a specific class? I don't even see how most of that is related to music
"Attendance will be taken at each event" 👀
they usually dont offer winter semester classes though
the only reason j term is a thing this year is bc of covid
By the looks of it it seems it has nothing to do with music but it’s just organised by the Institute
Idk it was in canvas
oh i just took the survey
i responded in the survey in a way saying if i have to pay separately for j term then i likely won't take the class
dont u have to get 2 doses before u go crazy
When did Zach get is vaccine? Today. How many Vaccines does he need? two
im tryna find a gif
Yes, and maximum efficacy is 1-2 months after 2nd dose. Innate immunity after having covid lasts for 60 days completely impervious, then your risk starts building again. With the vaccine, you have 4 months to a year of completely impervious, then you are at risk of contracting, but you get a cold, not bad symptoms, then you get impervious again as your immune system is retrained
iwas joking i know bc my mom already got it 😭
I want to educate ppl
What did I miss
cant handle the truth
they cant breath cuz rona
zach didnt get the rona vaccine
deleting isnt for cowards deleting is for
probably since i dont type in complete thoughts
since i havent had one since like
but still
Because I don’t have a life
So Covid19 is a necrotising infection, and because its an upper and lower respiratory pathogen, it causes a large amount of acetylcholine to be released in the general area of the basal membrane in the nose. The nasal and olfactory pathway is the one pathway which bypasses the thalamus and goes instead to the olfactory bulb, which then moves towards the pons, and medulla oblongata, which control both respiration and sleep. This huge, enormous inflammatory pathway causes the brain in these cortices to be inflammed, slightly herniated, and hypertrophic, and brain swelling quickly leads to hypoxia due to insufficient nutritional support, and sensitive neurons. Therefore, the areas of the brain which control the respiration rate and sleep are damaged significantly, which is why you have people that are hypoxic with Spo2s of around 82, but yet aren't breathing hard. Additionally, it explains the mechanism of why there are patients who are tachy/bradycardic when there is no visible respiratory distress. Covid 19 simply harms the shit out of your regulation areas for your most important functions
Wow I don’t have a life
did u see that study from like
Nah he did the study himself
That doesn't surprise me
F now I’m scared again😃
you can't be scared if you don't know what it means. That's my strat
I wonder if Covid is bad for kidneys then
Then you have Anticholeragenic factors which make that shit go down
are u like studying for something
Gotta know all this shit
bc this is def something i would do if i were studying
but I still have to take 114
i dont think i spelled that right but i dont care
lame
214 is either pain or fine depending on professor
It’s not bad
It’s just A LOT OF WORK
oh
damn
i hate reading textbooks
If you think 214 is bad you're going to self immolate at 216
It was just a lot of work
Of content that wasn’t bad
I heard that my Ochem lab this semester is going to make me die
i hate evolutionary and ecology
thats why i took cell bio last cem
lame
its not even that its hard, its just boring

Apparently its stupid easy all online

fake ones don't count
I can give you an ochem exam rn
idk ochem :c
i know how ot make meth from breaking bad
even though its a fake recipe
@toomanyzs content-wise how is biol 215 I’m trying to mentally prepare myself
Okay when covid hit in spring last year apparently she gave tf up and said no online tests, only mastering Bio as points, no quizzes. Just homework.
Idk if that's still the case
because homework was the only grade
It’ll be hard to go back to traditional school
im just scared of going back to school
And did last semester
idk how to be a person anymore seeing people everyday
Not this past fall apparently
Oh bruh
oh
i think i have everything but idk if im missing something stupid
thats long gone
dont rely on ur parents, gotta keep track urself
cuz u gotta repack it in a few months
i have a suite bathroom so it won't be too bad but yeah i got them

that's a need
People be wiping Shit in the showers according to meg
oh yea i forgot abt that
wtf
shit in shower
finn is wrong
oh she wanted you to know clarke has carpet toilets
comfy on ur butt tho
i need room to roll about
i dont think the spring ppl got to choose anything
People tend to make really good friend groups due to the layout
Oh okay, he's new, I don't know him
i didnt rly know that many girls on my floor
meg went out fishin?
how bad are the rooms tf
idk ive heard good and bad
In fact I've never been drunk

oh
Nah they don't like that
i miss shaunte
Yeah I do miss her
but not really
How did you find that
Guys I’m sleepy yet I’m choosing to not sleep this is why I’m never well
I have been having a terrible, awful season rn
cant really tell if i like or dont like it
I was gold 4 last season at peak then i went down to s2
diamond is pretty damn good though
One of the other RAs in Mistletoe last year was diamond
I just don't play at all during the school year
I'm an ADC main but that's kind of trash rn because of all the damn assassin items
I didn't get it
because it was boring
and that's why I didn't get it
pirate this shit
Howdy you need to download yourself a microphone
then i've been playing this damn game again
realm of the mad god
dead chat
@zacharious lol was my audio broken
Back in high school I used to wake up at 4:30am
Now I go to sleep at 4:30am
Mmmmm I can feel those antibodies
I have some sad news
today a guy from umass amherst found out I don't actually go to byu hawaii
rip
How did he even find out?
and ever since i got my byu hawaii t-shirt I *had* to wear it on camera
it really did the trick
Lol what raid? did i miss out on fun
Oh
Apparently
I’ve been getting around that much as well lately
so now we gonna see fancy blender shit
Couldn’t watch the entire thing
well bill learned about camera pathing in blender, and went vroooooooooooooom
just realized its like a week till the move in deadline
Howdy is about to pull the “we have too many rn” card
noyanka tho
Very similar though
Not last
could b last name tho
Idk if it could be a last name
doesnt this rely on students saying their choices and being truthful?
poor life decisions
nobel turned down harvard for us 😍
i feel like this site
also, just got a notification i've never seen before, "moisture in charging port"
@everyone Sam turned down upenn for case
Sorry
I got waitlisted at both Brown and NW and WashU didn't give any money so I was down to case and osu (with OSU being marginally cheaper) so I ended up going to Case
I didn't get into a single top 20 school 🤡
so i guess i'm saving my mental health
i regret not applying to Vanderbilt. my mom did not want me in Tennessee at all so she didn't let me apply :(
We got into college and then in 3 years we're going to begin our excruciating grad school applications
I applied to Vandy in the last minute because they didn't require essays
I don't really care about sports, but that doesn't mean I don't care about my university
Also I heard that for division 3 case isn't bad
But idk if that's true
Idk either
means it's a small school
It's important to note that while division is correlated to student body size, the size is merely a confounding variable; athletic divisions are instead determined by athletic scholarships (or the lack of them). Division III means that the university treats athletes the same as any other students (subject to the same admissions standards, no athletic scholarships)
It means that students don't get scholarships for being athletes, but also signals that the school doesn't care much about sports relative to other schools
yeah d3 doesn't award scholarships
why isn't our mascot the nerds lol
Oh
*no one shows up to the games still*
That just proves my indifference because I never even knew the football team won a conference until you mentioned it today nobel
while I chose not to attend OSU I still support the bucks
OH
I'd go to a football game if:
1) I wasn't overloaded with work
2) It was free
3) There wasn't corona
4) It isn't super cold
5) I have friends to go with

In other words, I'm not going ever
Well you aren't on campus are you? 👀
distance has nothing on us✨ ✨ ✨
We need to do more midnight freezing Dunkin runs
OH LNFAO
i'll come to visit friends but i won't come just for football as the sole reason
you don't know what I look like?
I've met Priyanka, Jenin (although she ignores me smh), and Adam, and apparently I yelled at a group of people when Nobel was in the common room one time
Someone wasn't wearing their mask
zach i have never met you but apparently you eat in solitude at leutners during lunchtime
wrong
lol when you didn't understand why I stopped you at first
i hope it's open tho :cri:
I know the gardens were open last I checked as well
I’m so directionally challenged it hurts
idk
I haven't fallen in a while
i haven't gone ice skating in about 11 years
Honestly german night slapped hard
I don't remember if I went to that
Also I eat in solitude in Leutner because 
1. Covid 
2. I don't like eating in my room 
3. I live on the 4th floor and I hate taking the stairs or the elevator with a bunch of food
And wasn't the mace incident in leutner?
the short answer is that not many people know
but it evolved stupid people in large groups, mace, and the hospital
Last year my room was the one right above the entrance to Tyler
can't avoid raymond if you're in raymond
I read the report back just now and I got the call at 1:59 am and I went to sleep at 7:05am
Wtf
@_lb18 are you LeAnn from kapelle's class?
I didn't know you were on here
Wtf 😂😂
He and I are not allowed to be on call together because terrible shit always happens
Yeah I woke her up at 3 am because I locked myself out and she didn't even get mad
I know lotssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss of people who aren't
Couldn’t be me^
For what class
The hard part is still caring for the ones that drive you up the wall
Or he’s gone
You have a year to live in res life and see if that's something you want to do
You leave behind the ability to live off campus, to have all privacy, give up nights to on-call,
If I don’t become an RA, I won’t mind it
I *hate* cloutfiends
Why do people want clout for being an RA
No they're premeds who want it as a resume builder
I mean, if I don’t think I can handle it due to time commitment and stuff
Then I won’t do it
``in it for power/clout`` damn make sure any discord mod isn't an RA
I wrote like two when i was a summer camp volunteer, they suck lol
Just because I seem to attract trouble
*never*
10mins
i tried giving advice on the rousseau server and got ignored :'))))))))
I can't give advice on there since I'm supposed to be a beginner
I feel like we just have to find a way to get the mods involved
I've messed up in my RAing but I've always fixed it, and I've never been involved in a conduct violation, nor have I done one that hasn't been caught.
*hasn't been caught*
Idk I just was squeaky clean my entire freshman year and then I became an RA and knew j had to be a role model
I gotta like 8 page document if you want to read that
oh my
Except STJ is 1 per floor
Or do people just want it individually
@toomanyzs we want it ♥️
i want it zach❤️
@chandachan @_frostyyyyy_ funny how we got an exam tomorrow
I'm studying for the test right now 🤡
We have two more exams following tomorrow
sorry i drifted off yes im curious
Guys I just realized in 3 hours it will be 21:21:21 in '21 in the 21st century
It not longer the 21st
dog
I can't believe they made a subreddit to bait kids into cheating
You don't have to be smart to take the AP exam
mfw my internet goes out in the middle of an exam
my exams have no time limit for this class
i used my phone hotspot but i freaked out for a min
bc the exam is like u cant go backwards
so i thought my answer didnt save
One of my greatest fears is having my Internet go out during an exam
yea idk its pretty chill w this class
Which class?
exams are open book open note open internet
rip
i won't see you all next sem
Why what happened
and i also need to drop like half of my classes
Ah shit
and my parents had been applying pressure for me to not come back
Aw :(
You still have time to rework your schedule though
i just happen to be in another time zone
why is cleveland so fucking cloudy
i havent seen the sun in weeks
i took a gap year
lake suck
I miss Cleveland so much
two were, the last one was just shit in terms of time
It sounds terrible to have to redo most of your schedule 10 days before classes start
When you say "shit in terms of time", I'm going to guess that you mean that it's in the early morning
oh yikes
it was an 8am est class
I thought that having to wake up at 7 AM CST for classes last semester was bad... I pity people in PST
but in terms of having enough time to complete work, if you adjust to EST, then you get 3 extra hours to study and still sleep at a reasonable time
Earliest I have to wake up this semester is at 8 AM CST for MATH 307. Attendance is strongly recommended in that class
not too bad
my earliest class is at 9:30 EST
The professor takes attendance at every class
idk which of my professors will take attendance
ik meyer wont
If you miss a class then you have to tell her in advance and then you have to watch the lecture recording within 24 hours to be counted as having attended
but given how hard that class is
nope
i took that last fall tho
i only went to lecture to turn in/pick up my hw, and to take/pick up exams
I heard that the grading scale consisted mostly of homework
when i took it the exams were 80%, and hw was 20%
Oh bruh
cuz imma dual degree with bs in electrical engineering and math
Can confirm; it only allows 1 school
ik ik, i just figured the default would b as many as u want
wtf
Smh howdy i'm disappointed
i dont think pri is palestinian
Ah shit
he's a chiang tho
Raunak never has nor will he ever simp for me
Double BS in EE and Math seems difficult... I was thinking of BS in CS and secondary major (BA requirements) in math
Any other math classes (besides Linear Algebra) that work for both math and EE?
WHY DIDNT WE THINK IF THIS BEFORE
imma do BS/MS in math so it'll take me a total of 8
How is it even possible to do a BS in EE in 6 semesters? Even with credit for Calculus 2 and Physics 2, that seems difficult
MATH 330's a good elective for EE and a requirement for BS in math
Though
I don’t have that many credits🤡
HES STILL GOING
I only had 3 credits that I didn’t even use 🤡🤡
But that’s nothing compared to @halcyon6561
even tho it was a dual enrollment program which used cleveland state curriculum
case didn't take it cuz it wasn't taught by a cleveland state prof
so i had to take the proficiency exams
I wasn't the biggest brain in the first place smh
the one for calc 3 was straightforward cuz it was paper and pencil
the one for diff eqs i didn't pass cuz it was multiple choice lmao
but i got a 97 in math 224
Isn't 224 diff eq tho?
imma stay here for grad to finish MS in math
i had to take it cuz i didnt pass the proficiency exam
i dont know if any of the 2025 ppl still peek here every once an a while, but if this mans 100mile wide brain and a dum dum that was doing alegrba 2 senior yr are in the same school, you guys are golden
Oh ic
Couldn’t be me
was light tho
Eye sea
Lol I took AP Stats freshman year because that was the only math I could take
Tbh I don't remember taking algebra 2
Though
Every AP class at my hs was hell
ye took stat 332 last fall
And over prepared us for AP exams
I took so many AP tests smh, the 2020 ap german exam was a joke tho
First semester I took MATH 126🤡
Legit if it wasn't scuffed I wouldn't have gotten a 4 in AP German because I can't speak a word of german
A 4 is still great though
It's a sad state of affairs that the absurdity of med school admissions encourages people to take easier classes just to get higher GPAs. Because of that, I think you made the right decision
idgaf about med school
Never gonna do it tho because I'm gonna fail those classes
I took it because a) I wasn’t confident in my skills from Calc BC despite getting a 5 on the exam and b) med schools want to see an actual grade for the class so...
I could’ve taken Calc 3, but nah
Yeah might need to actually take a math class smh
I took math 126
But I still have credit for math 121 and 122 LOL
But I need 304 and possibly 223 and 380 so those will be my math courses
the calc bc exam is ez, even my friend's dumbass brother still got a 5 on it LMFAO
I don’t know
Med schools won’t give a crap
im taking 304 and 380 as well, those will work as electives for math
rly wanna learn some info theory tho (394), but idk when that will be offered again
last fall?
I’m taking PSCL 282 and STAT 312 in my undergrad career as my remaining math classes
PHYS 122, ENGR 210, ENGR 225, and MATH 224
cuz i didnt take classes last spring
i was mostly doing landscaping work
could've taken 21 with math 330, but the prof said class was full
Still not as hard as BME
This semester, I'm taking CSDS 233, MATH 304, and MATH 307, and I was considering adding MATH 224. I've heard some people say that 224 is easy, but I'm still wary of taking 4 math/CS classes
Where's your School of Medicine role smh
not anymore
u need to have taken calc 3 already to take diff eqs
oh
It shouldn't do that
I got a 99 on the first test and 100 average on the homework due thus far, but the class is getting more difficult
Nope
Still only have CAS
ah sick
Are you taking a January class?
nope
But CAS isn’t showing
I’m going back to CAS I don’t feel confident enough to have the SOM role🤡🤡
if u understand the concepts well then math 224 ain't gonna be too bad lmao
If I take MATH 224 then I'll swap out either ECON 309 or ECON 342 for it in my schedule, but I'm still thinking about it
Intermediate micro and public finance. I'm minoring in econ and thought that I should get it done early since a lot of CS classes have prereqs that I haven't done yet
If I take MATH 224, however, that counts towards a CS major and potentially a math secondary major
My schedule doesn’t sound as grueling as yours lol
So far... not bad? We’ll see when I take ochem this fall🤡
oh shit that'll be fun
Still 🧠
Fyi: she turned down northwestern and northeastern
But yeah I left northeastern with a heavy heart
close friend of mine studied econ at northwestern, now he's huge into trading and real estate
I think I would’ve died in Northwestern’s pre med
my sister's going there to study bio and psych
I wasn’t even invited to interview🤡
She’s class of 2025?
Neither was I although I knew I wasn't
@nobelium19 I wasn’t even sure if they’d let me apply
oh
Ppsp grants you automatic acceptance into case's med school right
Well conditional acceptance but you have to maintain a 3.2GPA or something which isn't *that* difficult
oh
so, i cant see ppsp without thinking its the pspspsps for cats
I heard 3.6 science gpa but I could be wrong
I don’t know
Fair
@School of Dental Medicine who trying to clean my teeth when I get back on campus for real
Oh
Just don’t ping any other school
@howdy_. can't you turn off the role mentions?
But I won’t
the reason they arent off is so if there is news that pertains to a certain school it can be shared
yea that would work
aka, its there for important stuff, so dont aboose it
I just someone on a hover board
Yeah my phone says it’s 6:07 PM EST on 1/22/21
weather go brrrr
it's raining snow :lmfno:
i love driving fast in the snow, its sick seeing the snow warp past me like a space warp
I don’t because I’m too scared to die 🤡
i saw snow space warp from the window today cuz it was very windy while snowing
@kaori_flute don't get robbed on the southside
If you are in trouble, I am one phone call away.
Superman aint got nothing on me
I’m only one call away
That took me back
fuck bills
fuck chiefs
none of that shit means a damn 20 yrs from now
Or should I just carve math theorems into some stone obelisks and pump iron all day
cuz those obelisks will still be standing after many centuries
we need whatever the romans made their shit out of
shit gets stronger over time
mostly materials tho
that's sick
all im tryna do is shit which opens my mind
o shit that must be an experience
I'm sure i havent heard them all, but he's mentioned bunch o lost ppl, druggies and  a few structures that have no biz being in a forest
lost ppl and druggies are just part of the forest, but the wack ass structures, that's what fascinates me lmao
I "Interned" as a ecology researcher for five days i know my shit
holy shit
guess so
elk are big and if they are horny they will fuck you up
holy fuck
bro idk google it
cuz u mentioned both are ungulates
how close are u to campus?
close enough to commute
how u change ya nickname i forgot
I WAKE UP TO HEARING THAT LARRY KING PASSED AWAY?
Damn
Rip Larry
Poor guy
@howdy_. the class is ez, the labs are trash tier
got a perfect on every single physics exam last fall
this spring im taking ECSE 245, 281, 309, 321, and MATH 307
i have mohseni for 245 and i heard the final for his class is 40% of the grade
well mr big brain, we aint all smurt
the main issue with the labs is that its a lotta unnecessary work for some trivial shit
in response to #deleted-channel 
you can eat the snow since it's cold as well 💀
Wouldn't you fail the labs if you didn't have an IOLab because you wouldn't be able to take measurements?
also it seems only 1 partner actually needs the iolab
Like 30 mins I guess
I wish
omg snap memories just reminded me <3 1 yr ago today someone left their underwear in the fucking communal shower stall
You can’t
Why would you want to?
yea u cant
Oh I can just hand you a few
i forget what it was but u have a camera on i feel like
@howdy_. i still have stayinh home role
not yet but I will be tomorrow
I am stupid
why is grubhub for leutner not working
dunno
wrong sam
What do you want to eat
same as last semester
~~i wish einstein bros was open~~
Case cash turned on today
Most likely not, but even if there were, I bet there's a rule that you can't buy them with casecash
Me watching y’all slowly make your campus while I’m stuck at home like 🥲
oh damn
Columbus, OH @halcyon6561
i'm in cuyahoga county so i'm rather close
I don't think barnes and nobles accepts case cash
just wanted to do some light laundering thats all
my gf goes to ohio state, and she's home cuz of corona
Not too bad to visit
@halcyon6561 living on OSU’s campus during Covid is a bad idea lol
that's the main reason she stayed home last fall
the plurality (1/6) of mine went to osu lmfao
I don’t have the exact stats since our senior edition of the newspaper was never published
Ooh forgot Kent state but not many went iirc
for our class there were 5
For the class of 2019
And they cut the program there
oh L
Our senior edition of our school newspaper never got published because of COVID
Holy crap was your hs super insane or somethin
ik one of the chicks who went to duke, she applied to case's ppsp, got yeeted by that, and got waitlisted, but she got into duke so that's sick
Except
oh
Just Cleveland tingz I guess
u mentioned mit as a meme, i didn't apply there, but my other options for regular were carnegie mellon, ga tech, and rice, cuz they got solid engineering programs
didn't need those anymore once i got in here
You seem like a genius who would’ve thrived at another good school
Sorry random question, but they have trolleys and stuff when moving in right?
OSU wouldn’t let me into labs because I wasn’t 18 in hs
Yeah so I was mentored but did all my work remotely
I shadowed at a private hospital
At the hospital that I shadowed at?
the hospital
ah that's sick
would general surgery would cover the procedures which doesn't require extremely specific understanding of the areas which need surgical treatment?
he took more ap classes that i didn't take, like ap english and ap euro, did better than me on the ACT, and was president of a couple clubs
Nah I wasn’t in a program sponsored by my hs. I sought out my shadowing and research opportunities
My hs didn’t have a quizbowl team
It's fallen a lot because the coach left
oh rip
Also nobody wants to study, and that includes me
that's the primary reason why i didn't stay on the team for long after being on varsity, the studying was a bit too much of a commitment
Solon is also goated and iirc they didn't "fall"
he double majored in physics and chem at UNCW, and now he's working at a research base in antarctica
yeah that's some hardcore shit
I've always wondered what it must be like to work at those research bases
I couldn't stand the cold
he's only able to talk to us lads for like an hour or so daily cuz thats when the satellite flies over
Level curves seem so simple after multiple integrals 🤡
pack your stuff so you can leave tomorrow
Damn he's a STEM guy and enutrepuer ?
Those kind of people arent common
u need something like a "dual mind" for that kinda shit
this convo happened cuz i brought up quizbowl with @nobelium19 after discussing college shit with @sprinkles2108
it was in galveston
i did not shadow a specific person
just the general people working 🤡
oh
Well fuck?
damn fr?
There's no food as in the meal plan doesn't open until tomorrow at 4:30pm
That’s so weird idk why they did that to y’all
radiation oncology
killing cancer
that's the kinda shit UH specializes in
cleveland clinic doesn't touch that field
mom used to do research there, and one time i asked her what cleveland clinic *isn't* highly ranked in, and she said oncology
a guy ik who came to cleveland for cancer treatment tells me that UH is where that's done, and cleveland clinic just refers ppl there
@chandachan u on campus yet?
nope not a premed
computer science
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
what about sharpware tho
they dont have all the wares, and i do not have coin, 0/10
which wares are missing?
Alright that pun didn't even make sense 😔
i don't get it but
*oui oui je suis d'accord*
this hurts
If anyone was wondering
Oh whoops should be in #food🍕
Don't catch covid-19 and die at a young age!
Can confirm spartan bot is dead
Someone plz submit a bug report I'm lazy
lazy too sorry
Sam doesn't want to write the bug report either I'm sad
I’m sleepy but I’m not sleeping ugh
but how would he fix it
Hi sleepy but I’m not sleeping ugh. I’m Raunak
Idk I'm a fake cs major not a real one
Pain.
And I’m still not sleeping
Oh
also @neptune234 sorry for pinging you best of luck in your move-in don't die please
guess i'm a fake cs major 🤡
My local library got rid of seating so I can’t work there so I’m stuck in my chaotic home🤡
damn
we could get cheap computer and use it to host
then ur pc can run shit for a long time without fucking itself in the ass
Oh Nobel was running it on his mac
Wrong one
Bro this is all you need
Sam raspis do be kind of unstable tho
Probably cause mine broke and I have no idea why but oh well
I didn't actually need it to work anyways so I got a workaround for the project
Linux also hates me in general
In case you couldnt tell i dont like to host things
I don't like \
close enough
*guys, he's lost it*
@toomanyzs you want to bet money on chiefs and bills?
thats a lose lose
It was two tired
Next time I’ll be on here, I still won’t be on campus💫💫💫
pis dont have short protection
lmao i ran dual boot on my laptop a while back
then i just stopped using windows
@nobelium19 Moving this conversation to general: how did you learn anything if the professor only lectured for an hour? Also, were you allowed to take the exams this early?
1. I didn't learn much, just read the "book"
2. There's literally no exams
I can't believe that there's no exams and a lot of assignments are drawings
I can't either
That class is a scam
Exactly my class, except add a money element: everyone is required to buy a $85 "textbook" that the professor wrote herself
Quick calculation: There are approximately 230 people in that class right now. If she gets half of the money from each book sold, she got $9775 from people buying the textbook for this specific class
I mean the prof did go on a rant about how she can't make money off her expensive hobbies so :cursed_flushed:
holy fuck lmao
Yeah she is a passionate dog breeder, but she said you can't make money off dog breeding the way she does it. So how else is it funded?
the fuck LMAO
oh
You still have to take SAGES though even if you took a lot of APs
Not if:
1. An adjunct faculty taught it
2. They don't accept the syllabus
3. You took it at a high school setting
They don't accept it if adjuncts taught it? Doesn't Case have their own adjuncts?
that's why my calc 3 and diff eq didnt transfer
They do not unfortunately
cuz it wasnt taught by a cleve state prof
imagine still having to take sages 🕺🏼
None of them transferred, save anatomy which I took at the college with an assistant professor
oh rip
I had tons of AP credits transfer tho, 28 if I'm not mistaken
im not going into med school
GPA is crucial for med school, it's important for other grad schools but probably not as much, idk
GPA still matters for other types of grad school to some degree
i took my last ones a year before the virus happened
I had to take both physics exams twice because they wouldn't submit
damn
still got 5's
That shouldn't be your fault, it's their fault, smh
it was painful though
i took every single ap stem exam except csp and enviro cuz those are cheap and don't transfer as anything useful to case
I didn't even know AP had enviro
i took math2, chem, and phys
I took Math2 chem and bio M
SAT Essay and subjects tests will no longer be available
Tbh shouldn't have taken them, they're useless for case
never took the actual sat, but my hs offered the act and i did very well on that
Couldn't be me
even tho the sat subjects didn't count, it helped me get a head start on physics lmao
i took it after physics 1, so i had to learn physics 2 shit to take it
I still don't know how since I got 34s/35s on all of my practice tests
Aren't they duplicates for case? Credit wise
yeah i stopped after i got 34
Because you don't treat the practice exams as highly, happens to all of us
the standardized tests would go much better if i got the whole time to work freely on the entire test, with a break in between
35.25 vibes :sad:
0 studying tho 😎
I don’t like flexing
Because I don’t have much to flex😎
ah, fair
Can anyone confirm if the Den is still a regular swipe?
i cant confirm
I would hope they would keep it a normal swipe tho
nothing is standing out in email tbh
Well they aint open yet lol
Also, bragging about high school test  scores does not make you any friends. Basing your image around numbers with plenty of variability and establishing your personality as one of competition-only, and such meritocracy, you might miss out on being a useful person
I dont care who wins as long as he loses
holy fuck LMAO
one time in middle school we were fucking around on the playground, and i rammed someone into a fence so hard it broke it
About the size of a school bus
and is this the story of how u lost ur medical license?
smh cam dont u kno planey stuff
Thankfully without wind it was like a giant super light blanket enveloping them
death by kite
damn
One time I tried jumping with it and it lifted me about 20 feet in the air and gently set me down
Haven’t tried that since
so what are you supposed to do with it
I have one of these “landboards” since I don’t live near a beach for kiteboarding
well guess what u got in cleveland
*I feel like that is hell on ur ankles tho*
wait that didn't work
Oops too late
tho i think they have motors
I probably should have but I left them at home since I didn't want to accidentally hit someone haha
When your dad texts you that it’s very slippery outside🤡🤡🤡
Can’t wait to ice skate back to my car after work !!
its all the ~~worst~~ kind of fast food there is, so have a blast
When I left theyhad crappy rice
Like I feel so drowsy afterwards
you want chocolate chip cookies?
I tried maybe I didn’t put it in right
want to meet at leutner soon? I can hand you a few
Which dorm are you? Don’t see you
I think the most chaotically college thing to happen to me this far is grabbing a handful of chocolate chip cookies
￼and taking them back to my room
i only grabbed 5 and was sad
Really good cookies tho @absence000
gosh i missed the den so much
it's been a while since I've overdosed on sodium
I know but I also don’t want to give myself a heart attack

RAUNAK IS VEGETARIAN CUZ HE DRINKS MILK

Mhm it was just roamin I guess
little italy is not that far away
Little Italy isn't that far
Guys im NGL Cleveland drivers REALLY SUCk at driving
oh
then why do ppl suck at driving so much
We can’t drive fast
define "suck"
i think californian drivers suck
Maryland drivers are the worst
NJ are the worst
USA are the worst
i almost got hit every time i went thru an intersection by idiots who didnt look when they turned right/left
GIRL WTF
HAHAHAH rip okay maybe ur right
apparently masturbating in a school zone is illegal because sperm go 35 mph instead of 25 mph
10 year old car
apparently an error in registration
I’ve never gotten pulled over knock on wood
That's so boring smh
that's a boring life
I am normally a grandma driver too it’s just that one road is hella annoying
anj, i get u dont got a car, but dont speed in ohio
if anyone has a car on campus i challenge them to a race
If you drive on or below speed limit under normal conditions I don’t respect you
We don’t speed when there’s a bunch of cars wtf
Those are the most annoying
Fair
Lmaooo I normally never do but sometimes u just gotta be wild yaknow
270 lame
Dont cross a street when there’s no crosswalk?
Cle lame
aren't men supposed to be the ones that are dangerous drivers :thonk:
i wasnt
@.fim. don’t need opinions from someone who’s never sat in a car where I’m the driver❤️
og drivers remember nothing because they're dead
whats the fastest u gone
ive gone 90 lol
I drove 95 mph when I went to Chicago 2 summers ago
Finn I won't lie
If I were ever in a car with you
it was a long time ago, i was learning to drive, it was on accident, and i dont defend it
I don't think it's true
i was learning to drive, i was on the highway where the limit was 70, i was going 75, then i went over a hill and wasnt rly paying attention
I go 5 above because I’m not an annoying driver
motorcycle accidents on highways tho 💀
I don't know self driving cars will always be a problem because of liability issues and stuff, don't know if that's ever gonna happen
dont get ticket
yeah but u wont actually get pulled over if youre going 5 over
or east asian i guess
depends on the cop tho
so miss me with that bullshit
self driving cars are gonna be exciting, cuz they'll be able to drive at much faster speeds safely
not rly, in fact theyll have to do it even less than normal people cause theyre safer, so that stuff is super overhyped, and irl theres nearly no situations where you actually have to chose between killing two people in a crash
oh man i ate food but im still hungry
Hi still hungry, I'm howdy, how are you
@chandachan holy fuck LMAO
i dont like salad :thonk:
Can't say the ~~chinese~~ food at leutner is good, ~~chicken~~ everything  was salty af
nope
Do they have the salad bar still?
Bruh I'm paying for the tendies run, someone has to return the favor smh
it doesnt look like i can get salad with mozz sticks
i dont see it
when does leutners close
its not listed tho
i thought it closed at 7 today
since its still break
I got some homemade Chinese food tho 😋
*or they ran out*
its not tho
*unless they don't look at the instructions*
theres even a veggie burger if u scroll down
they arent from cleveland
wish I could get the burger without cheese
cuz
Basically you just use your card and it gets taken out of your casecash balance
Well that money can only be spent on food and the bookstore (minus academic supplies)
*its for people that cant manage their spending habits tbh*
I don't mean to brag but I didn't spend a dime in CaseCash last sem 😎
They want money
nobel u didnt get mitchells?
isnt that bad cause u wasted money
don't waste casecash for the den
just dont get any more
cuz u can get it for a meal swipe
the menu is slightly diff tho
since its tied to being stuck at case
and doesnt roll over
so use it or lose it
semesters ye tho
bruh i literally just want some fucking vegetables
yeah but if u can get the option that u want with meal swipe
why get it with casecash
but its stupid to spend money on food
i dont want to waste money
target shuttle goes every saturday
oh it just adds up damn
dont wanna spend money on food tho, i should be able to get everything i need
but even worse
it closed down
fuck
money
not enough students used it
there used to be one but it got bankrupt cuz covid
To the Case administration and all med schools: I, Nobel, do not condone nor will I ever condone the usage of alcohol and underage parties. I will never do anything against Case's code of conduct. This was a friendly public service announcement.
the den tho
If you want to eat healthy, you have 2 options:
1. Don't come to Case
2. Starve
if u want burgers and pizza and tendies
really do
I don't know about you, but my parents use low oil, low sodium, low sugar, and they switch white with brown sugar
we never use sugar
except in our porridge
i dunno
finn i'm giving away an alienware in the zoom
sorry
That's an oxymoron, sorry but Lenovo is the worst
also alienware isnt lenovo lol
sorry howdy
don't want to dox

Swipes don't work ?
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
iirc u can't do anything till u get tested
but he isnt here yet
when does leutner close?
dunno
til 7pm
sad
i lost mail 🤡
oh no
Oh no
They're a little slow processing packages
oh
I don't think packcity holds mail indefinitely
yea, i got a letter sent (dunno by who or by what) but when i went to wade they were like "we lost it oops"
Everyone do be ordering everything tho
Where do they get the money smh
it was 2 weeks ago tho 😔
Well I know they aren't that slow
They also probably aren't at full staff capacity though
sad
Who needs a tv in college
I don’t even have a tv in my room anymore I watch everything on my laptop or iPad
Tv remotes are very annoying
The hardest part about leaving is saying bye to those you will miss the most ❤
Ah rip
You’re leaving that behind?
dont think u can take those on an airplane
Ah rip
@addat I can feel your pain. If you need someone to talk you, I’m always here
I feel sorry for your loss
fire extinguisher is gonna miss u adam like u miss her
Yeah guys long distance isn't working out
None of them can replace the one at home tho ❤
Damn 😔
rip
Adam you need to get side ~~hoes~~ fire extinguisher
I'm honestly shocked ive never had to use that one
so you guys weren't at campus at all last year?
campus is so much more lively 
serotonin levels went up
Yeah jenin you never left right?
u don't have to take everything
aaaand chat died
oooh
i am sorry
@kaori_flute even though you stayed on-campus, you were always at home, in my heart ❤️
But won’t it be melted tho?
Oh
Does anyone wanna have a crying sesh with me
so priyanka
crying session
let's go
WTF
Okay guys crying session in 30 mins
Is there something I don’t know?👀
Nope
Does anyone wanna play/talk I can in 30mins
I’m sleepy
So I can’t
She hasn’t completed any of my games
LMAO you haven’t completed them smh
It’s been a fat minute
go to sleep @sprinkles2108
People don’t floss
Which dentists find very annoying
I can't imagine not flossing, my teeth feel terrible if I go many hours without flossing
Oral health has especially high correlation with cardiac health due to the highly vascular nature of the mouth and pharynx
Endocarditis is found to have a link with bad oral health
Oh I don’t. Interesting
I’ll be honest I had bad oral hygiene habits when I was younger
Idk why lol
HEB does go hard
Yeah I’m a non-Texan and I don’t know what heb is
SAME except I shop at Kroger though. Kroger and Meijer are amazing
Eh. I guess not? I was never recommended fluoride rinse or waterpik so. I brush twice a day and floss at night
It’s supposed to be before zhanda
It seems like your routine is really hard on your enamel
Did you know that halitosis can get bad enough that it makes your sneezes stink
secrets the dental school kids dont want u to kno
There doesn't seem to be a clear consensus other than telling people not to brush immediately after a meal
I guess there’s no true answer, just as long as you brush your teeth period
I’ve heard many dentists say before though
Informative too if your oral hygiene needs improvement
i couldnt agree more
I've gleaned so much information from this conversation
In the last year, I've seen a dentist, an orthodontist, and an oral surgeon like half a dozen times 🙃
Bro I’ve only seen my dentist twice in the last year for a cleaning
Howndid you feel after the anaesthesia
Soft flex: I never went through ortho treatment😎
Did you say slme words you wish you could have retracted
you took a picture of your laptop
No I found a jpeg of somebody else's laptop
I don't need plastic surgery
rip
don't judge
Spread love not hate❤️💫✨
I think he got lost in my dms
7-8 hours 😔
6 hours
3 take it for leave it
I get 9 hours of sleep
What happens if you don't get sleep:
> Some of the most serious potential problems associated with chronic sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Other potential problems include obesity, depression, impairment in immunity and lower sex drive.
Sorry nothing is scarier than a prion
@_frostyyyyy_ I've noticed I feel much better when I sleep well
Definitely. I haven't had a night of less than 6 hours sleep since finals ended and I feel great
Especially if I just went hard in the gym on that day
Definitely. I excused too many sleepless nights before by telling myself that it was worth it for my schoolwork, but I realized that I just had bad time management and that extra sleep + exercise made me feel a lot better
check out mad cow disease and creutzfeldt-jakob disease
that's how prions fuck shit up hard
Yeah today I realized that I’m very much out of shape
I went from doing nothing during the last semester to 5 hours of moderate-intense aerobic exercise a week and I feel a lot better now
Yeah I should get back into working out
This semester I don’t know though
I wish I could go swimming
i generally don't do much cardio, aside from long hikes
Some schools require you to know how to swim if you want to graduate
lol doesn't MIT do that
I think that over time fewer schools are requiring it though
CWRU still has a phys ed requirement
But they didn’t love me so
cuz theres no way actual phys ed classes can work remotely
So priyanka is taking her talents to CWRU, where she is carving a slow but steady path towards her dream medical school
When I’m not working hard enough🥲🥲
10/10 class
@_frostyyyyy_ that should work
But I don’t have the time unfortunately
Yeah it takes plenty of dedicated training, to the tune of 200 hours or so
That makes sense, I don't know what most of the phys ed courses will actually teach that you can't learn easily yourself
You just got a 4.0 GPA for the last semester, is that not the result of your hard work?
Because only premeds could consider a 4.0 to be indicative of not working hard enough, right?
lol idk
isn't a 4.0 almost mandatory for med school admissions or what
unfortunately for premeds that do be true
I just can't imagine basing my plans on getting a 3.9 GPA and a 99th percentile MCAT
damn lol
its like how gre, gmat, all college board exams, and the act are sanctioned by ETS
apparently ETS is a 501(c)
@_frostyyyyy_ apparently 524 is 99.5%
Aren't you already an officer in a vision extracurricular?
corona hit that hard fr
Pinging me in 1am won't help me get sleep lol
that's sick af
I didn't get anything from sages prof through email all semester
I couldnt see the name of it
I didn't get some I had to meetbwith her and explain, it seemed she didnt add mento a list or somethkng
for e&m shit
oh yeah
the one near veale
They melted tho qq
Fair
I cut mine off already
I forgot to take mine from the testing center
LMAOO didn’t they remind you like 6 times
I think i left it at the place where you have to run to
couldnt be me
Anyone got a summer internship/research position yet?
10 months in and still have not been tested
I'm thinking of cold emailing dozens of professors asking to help them with their research
But i need dem internships
for real tho 🥲
Rip
Nothing has been added there for weeks
I'm still unsure... I've heard that the networks classes here are good though
I haven't talked to my advisor in like two months 🤡
The discrete math prof right?
Lol. CS research in my interests isnt very accessible to underclassmen or even undergrads
I havent declared yet, but either ai or algos
Ive heard the AI classes are hard to get into
Woah really?
Idk in certain areas yes
Both are really good tho
Wtf do you need to do then lmao
Uhh idk at that point they can just pull the candidates out of a hat and end up with good results
*Discrete math*
is discrete supposed to be hard at case
oh duh
Yeah. I unfortunately did not do that bc my advisor didnt really push me to declare
Idk i think Adam got some special MechE software
But idk for CS
I don't think CS gets anything 🤡
thats a bad thing
i mean im mostly joking, but i already get may too many useless emails
I want to ask my math professor for a letter of recommendation but there are 4 other people in her office hours right now 🤡
I want to apply to some REUs and I need professor recommendations
Oh nvm
does any know if i can still apply to be a math si even if i skipped out of calc 1 and calc 2
I've been to her office hours more than 90 percent of the class, maybe one other guy has talked to her more than me
ok cuz technically it says you had to get an A in the class
I asked Gabe Foss(an Si for MATH 122) and he told me that you get into an SI position if you have a reference or you get lucky
from the professor of the class
oh cuz i never had butler so i was probably gonna have sell write a letter of req
Or yea that could work too
He's in my MATH 223 class right now
Idk why he took it again
Dude gabriel balls out in math 223 lmfao
like he just appears for the exam and leaves
I've been to every office hours and have never seen him
yeah I have never seen him either he's a real baller
Cause hes taken it twice b4
why is he taking it again then wtf
Cause he didnt get a good grade i think
I'm surprised that he became an SI for MATH 122 if he has to retake MATH 223
idk sometimes ppl have a rough semester or personal problems that can get in the way of school
it's already sold 😦
all i have left is a pair of drift induced joycons i left at home
i'll need 3 references for BS/MS
once i take more math courses i'll get to know more profs who understand math
Sorry if repeated question, when is the deadline for add drop?
I think 2 weeks into the semester
one of my fav patients at the nursing home i was at ate prunes and cheerios w sugar and milk every morning
one lady gets regular everything except for salad. She only eats pureed salad
thick juice rubs me the wrong way

The American Heart Association recommends at at least 150 minutes of moderate-intense activity a week and ideally 300 minutes
me whose athletic activity has been disrupted due to covid and never bothered to try to get back into my rhythm: 🤡
doing activity now would prevent problems in 10 years
Old people actually need to exercise even more
> Study after study shows that the health benefits of physical activity become more important, not less important, as we age
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/01/daniel-lieberman-busts-exercising-myths/
~~i never went to the gym, too risky, might do it this semester tho~~
No risk of knee injury either
Just don't bonk your head on the gutter
agreed on every level omg
I feel attacked
It's true that running burns slightly more calories, but:
Swimming is definitely much safer in terms of avoiding injury than running
Swimming engages more of your muscles than just your legs and lower body
For people who have arthritis or joint pain, swimming is much easier on the joints
oh cuase u missed ur plane?
that was last winter
oh
why are u coming so late then
You have to get tested before you move-in although they aren't really strict about that
If you arrive early you can't get into the dorms
Mine seems to work fine
Damn nice

I mean I’ll come get some if jenin hasn’t already gone out
Ah okay I didn’t wanna make you come outside twice

well people tried less used channels at first, and started forming alliances with other colors
probably so it's easier to remove in case it gets bad? idk
if you want
i can't feel my legs or hands
so hard to type
they are still in the cold stage
I looked today and I was able to do it so
I got it one time skiing aid it was terrible
felt like my fingers were getting crushed from the inside out for weeks when trying to sleep
omg
no it's not that bad
if you are ever getting cold, just tell ur body no
no cold
Shit did I miss a gathering?
It was super cold tho
"cold"
Wasn’t it snowing a while back?
if u follow that 1 simple trick that doctors dont want you to know about
phone + water = bad
nope
sorry
It should be expanded tho
if the den doesnt change hours expect a google form in the coming days
it's 32 mins from 11:17 tho
I don't care anybody
I don’t know if I will I do be sleepy
Bruh it's not even 11pm yet
March is still bit cold so
Not may that’s finals season
Still too early and cold
I can't tell you because I don't know when my midterms are 🤡
2 of our bio exams are in March🤡💀
holy shit
“That’s too much of a commitment rn” GUYS I DONT LIVE IN THE CLE AREA
I can’t come once a month🤡
u live in the same state tho
back when shit was in person, i drove down to visit my girl every 2 weeks or so, depending on what I needed to do
My parents won’t let me drive to campus by myself
oh that changes everything
And they won’t drive me more than weekend
steal a car
That's a rip
I’d still be alone
i dunno what ur on about
Why do you have two exams in one month? 🤡
Oh
3-4 weeks apart
I don’t think we have lockdown browser
@_frostyyyyy_ guo requires lockdown browser for the quizzes and exams
what do u u need honorlock for?
I don't know
Computer within a computer basically
haven't tried it
i think its indistinguishable from a normal computer
Lockdown browser won't work if you try to load it in a virtual machine
oh shit
it detect it, cuz the vm screams that is a virtual machine
I already tried it with virtualbox. It works with parallels tho but it’s really slow
just have a laptop too shitty to download lockdown
there are probably are certain virtual machines u can do where it doesnt detect
Does Lockdown browser work on Linux?
I've never watched anime

Before completing residency... as in do we get to plan where we want to work after we complete residency?
Because I don't think so they do. Most would go wherever they're hired (unless they decide to open their own practice)
Because I got the impression that you don't get a lot of choice over you where do your residency due to limited supply
oh
one is enough
Is case wireless broken for y'all?
It’s saying it can’t connect for some reason
I can't connect either
why so late?
He has exams
oh
If you're worried
Yea the Case VPN doesn’t work for me
On my laptop at least
because people are pissed at billionaire hedgefund managers so they're conspiring together to make them lose 5+ billion over the course of a few days

This is one of the reasons I got a laptop with an Ethernet port
oh
mine got fixed
they dont make it heavy, its the other stuff that adds weight
i think slack broke my internet
idk why orgs use that smh

```I think people see greentext and say fuck this im out```

It looks scary

That I would not be dealing with vomit, considering I've been on campus for about 8 hours
But yet
guess it
man eats eggplant and then rides bicycle and his gear breaks in the bicycle making him cry and go to the hospital
oh wow it's been a while since we looked at this face
derailing chat a bit - people who've emailed for jobs - how much fluff is too much fluff before the "Can I work here" statement?
I'm just trying to work over the summer at my local optician that I've been to since a child
i want to do that 😳
Interested in optometry study, figure working as an optician assistant/apprentice would be good
I haven't been to an optometrist for 18 months 🤡
A few years ago I didn't wear glasses and now I need them to read small text 🤡
I can't believe that my eyes are only going to get worse from here

I can improve my cardiovascular health significantly by improving my diet and exercising more, but there doesn't seem to be such an easy solution for eyes

and then u just remember without looking
David don’t you take caffeine pills too?
I also take vitamin D since I don't go outside that much because of COVID-19
Damn why no oranges tho?
Damn you be eating healthy
Apparently calcium supplements are one of the few that are usually considered bad so I'm avoiding that in favor of eating cheese
I don't do bench presses
David doesn’t his brain does
it's cause you don't have to, you were born able to press that much
David didn’t fertilise his own egg cell he just forced himself to develop the other 23 chromosomes
sorry I have no idea what’s going on
David used to have a twin in the womb but ripped it in half and ate it
I don't see how this is surprising
@_frostyyyyy_ how was the exam?
David gave god the multivitamin pills and god didn't flood Noah's arc
@moseslee guess this one
I have a 97.5% grade right now but I feel like that could fall quickly depending on my exam 3 grade... my grade usually falls towards the end
I never thought I would see a day when the top article on Reuters is about r/wallstreetbets
and why is it freaking wall street out
Short sellers have lost a whopping $5 billion on GameStop in the last few weeks
Yeah wtf is happening
but what does that have to do with a subreddit tho
_stupid_
I feel like they are only getting screwed over in the very. very, short term. tbh i wanna short gamestop just for shits and giggles as the meme will die eventually
do you not find it sad that people are willing to spend so much for this? The prank has five dollar signs on yelp i bet
yeah, but why do people fuck around with their personal finances just for the meme
tesla vs gamestop tho
they lose more than they gain
cuz STONKS
u hate it cuz you aint em
this is still funny to me even though i only have a vague idea of what stocks are
I beat the market tho, look at how much i gained today
i mean i have never invested
(cuz i have no money 2 invest)
I lost 2.51% to be exact
what do you invest your money in
the most boring shit ever, i hate putting up with finances if you couldn't tell
AND it's not even clear if trying to beat the market is possible for a smol brain like me so i won't even try
dont wanna risk my meagre savings
idk what about doing it with real money makes it fun, that's what i dont get with wallstreetbets
does he have a casino still?
how well does it work
don't have enough money to really invest
i mean i have some money saved from a job i worked in earlier but i have no idea what to do with it
let alone know what to invest in
That money goes into paying your tuition next year Moses
u dont need to do anything clever
average is ~8% year over a long period of time 🤷‍♂️ up to you tho
> At nearly 14 percent, the return to college easily exceeds various investment benchmarks, such as the long-term return on stocks (7 percent) or bonds (3 percent).
it seems like it could be skewed because a) selection bias and b) time is invested in college, not just money
but it seems biased in favor of college for the reasons i mentioned
They said that they accounted for opportunity cost in their paper https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci20-3.pdf
> Our 2013 life-cycle wage estimates indicate that someone pursuing a bachelor’s degree would forgo almost $96,000
> in wages
The return is near all-time highs because the college wage premium is near all-time highs
oh intersting
but most people at state schools dont have scholarships or financial aid, do they?
but anyways its good the counted for lost wages
the other thing i was worried about is selection bias tho
Any statisticians here who can tell us if going to any college or going to an elite college is the cause of increased earnings of college graduates, or rather if the higher salaries of college graduates is due to some other traits that also increase likelihood of college attendance?
kill it
Leave baby yoda alone

Cutter being evacuated right now due to something burnt in kitchen,unless it's a test at  240 am
Alarm still on
when i'm not bothered to use kitchen appliances i wolf down cold cuts
we dont sleep
cold rice be hitting hard
I thought my alarm woke me up
And it was ringing for sooo long
DOn't die ❤️
rip it's 3 am for the,
I wanted to get up at 6😭😭
better then last semester when the fire fighters showed up w/ their axes cuz someone set the alarm after hot boxing their room
Okayyyyyyy yea this wasn’t that bad then 😅
Bruh it was soo cold outside
I had worn a down jacket but it was still kinda cold
One hedge fund lost billions of dollars because of this
I wonder if it will last
Is it normal for your personal relationship between your family to be affected for not choosing to go a specific university, even though you didn't really want to in the first place?
Because now I really don't want to go to Case, I know if I waste my whole time applying, I'm simply going to get rejected. For what, so I can stay for atleast a year before transferring
I don't know what to feel anymore
Aren't we already well past the application deadline?
I don't really care anymore at this point
I wanted to go abroad since I wish to practice medicine in Australia.
I'm applying to Kent and Akron, I just want to stay a year before transferring
I really don't know what to do at this point, I personally fear my funding for university is going to be cut if my parents don't support me
I've been threatened that I'm going to fail by taking initiative of my own things.
Every conversation is them telling me I need to stay local
I'm also disillusioned about living in the US since the last few years, I really just want to leave and never turn back
I'm sorry if this is a bit of a ramble, but I feel like a complete failure at this point. I don't know what to do and I'm sick and tired of making any decisions. I just want to roll into a ball and forget about the world.
You are not a failure. You just need time to figure things out, and everything will fall into place.
I try, but it doesn't really work out and they just assume I'm too naive
I don't think disillusionment with the US should be a factor in where you go to college because many of the things that you are disillusioned with may change but your education will be important for your entire life. It's also difficult to immigrate.
Like just letting them hear you out completely without interruptions
It can be difficult, but I would insist on them trying to find common ground with you
That way your relationships aren’t compromised over your education
For me, I believe my life and work would be better by immigrating. Australia isn't a bad place, and I've learned it better to study where you want to practice
but I only need 2-3 years to get permanent residency
I only need to pay domestic fees then, but the problem is paying rent and getting loans or equivalent
I can work in the undergrad to afford enough to start living there + start working there to pay everything else
Hmm if you’ve done your research and you’re certain then I don’t think anything should be able to stop you
Your parents (legally) can’t stop you
Have you tried talking to another extended family member about your plans? Maybe they could convince your parents?
True, they can't, but there words can affect me.
Because they can’t interrupt what you wrote but can interrupt you verbally
but I don't know if they would support the idea
Try to have a conversation with your parents again, like Dhananjay said, assert the “no interrupting” rule. If they still don’t budge then write a letter
Without interruption
They won't follow that rule, they're from Eastern Europe
It won't work, I've tried it to no avail
Yo about that cursed flushed reaction I promise I wasn’t being xenophobic
Just run away
@ Yes, I want to get into the honours program from a certain university, I don't meet the requirements yet, but if I prove well during uni I can transfer.
Your parents can’t control you after medical school
Yeah don’t think too much dude
@sprinkles2108 Please don't take me to hell, practicing in America
I would never
And don’t beat urself up
too much money to study here, minus well study there
*worst*
_worst_
they need you here
I can tell you a socialist revolution isn't coming to America. If anything North America and Europe will be one of the last places to fall to a revolution.
I just want to study medicine and live my life. I also wish to advocate for my ideas, but I know what politics is like...
I kinda want to start my own co-op though, that would be nice
anyone have a broom and dust pan they want to lend me
📣 Finn was shaving his balls in his room and now he needs to clean up his mess! Can someone please provide him with a broom and a dustpan!
fr tho
@mgster want to lend me a broom
ron y arent u in the zoom smh
OH SHIT

Everyone was so upset about the meeting yesterday just for this to happen lol
oh why not
Eye sea
eye wave 🔼
He has a final exam in 51 minutes
its just dumb tho cause it comes down to honor code anyway
Don't some have cameras?
Well yes, but one could hide notes behind their computer
Not University Housing spelling their own buildings wrong 💀
Yeah last semesters' expired already I believe
Oh shit yup I see it now
Didn't chem have cameras?
Why are you so determined to be able to cheat
and like its annoying for nursing bc like u really should know this stuff
but if ppl want to cheat theyre always gonna find a way
well maybe not academically but if you talk about partying rn Zach will fuck you up
although they 100% deserved it but still
You don’t wanna know that
I think it's probation for two semesters instead of one but idk
Double probation is where you have 2 strikes left
the guys in the room next to me do tho 👀
Zhanda i meet you from the other side of math
But we cant go out so f anyway
How did you find out
Are they still an ra
im not on campus so i dont get gypped outta 16k/yr, and i can have my own fun
violating a series of protocols you're supposed to be enforcing can get you fired
shit gets real if the cops gotta get involved
no i'm making a statement about how cops aren't fired for breaking rules they're supposed to be enforcing
that's a fair point
I haven't had to yell at anybody yet and I've been here for 48 hours
I can't tell if this is big brain or just rampant opportunism
be hitting hard
fuck that
maybe
most people are sleep tho
sad
i'm about to sleep or i would've joined
my family is not religious anymore
fair, lotta asians are atheist/irreligious
it gets human societies from the tribal level (groups of 100-300) up to the level of cities and nations, and allows them to build large scale shit
I got the impression that the university was on a bad path before her tenure began
can't we're gonna get covid protocoled
@chandachan shouldn't you be packing?
can i be vaccinated tho
Only the 1st shot tho meg
Aparently the 2nd shot hurts more than the first
it hurts when a doctor gives u a deep shot
i dont think shots are supposed to go that deep :thonk:
For me, I’m a volunteer at my local hospital
damn I wish I was that cool
I need to find my badge though🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Even if I were bald I could go to Pretoria
ive literally already been to south africa so suck my nuts bald boy
i went on exchange
@sprinkles2108 can u schedule one at a CVS near u?
I'm not a healthcare worker like everyone else at Case is so I'm probably not going to be able to get a vaccine for a couple months
dead chat holy crap
Sorry I have a dentist appointment
dead chat
anyone take anth 102 with goldstein last sem
the one he wrote isnt on there 💔
trying to sucker us out of more money

J term anthro class had to buy a damn book too smh
It wasn't 225 either, right?
if anyone needs the beckers world of the cell for bio 215 i got u
oosp wrong persob
Sorry!
Bye!
holy fuck
i  think i forgot i ordered by the time my food was ready
I'm gonna start ordering early and reselling my tendies
How many people are normally going to the Den on a weeknight at 11 PM though?
I feel like more than you’d think
That's what I thought... I don't think many people eat big meals from Denny's at 11 PM on weeknights
can't eat at the den but it's super unhealthy
Why can't you eat there?
To be fair to The Den, it looks just as calorific as any other fast food restaurant. I would probably occasionally go there but I wouldn't want to eat there every day
And I didn't feel good afterwards
To be fair, I forgot to eat lunch and breakfast
i didn't eat them
lol im jealous
isnt the limit 2 a day
Ur in the village tho right?
Not anymore
oh Zack is in storrs
Rip zack
Ah so you got out of the meal plan? Damn
Apparently “I’m picky” isn’t a valid reason to get out of it
i dont live on campus lol
I mean I am picky too but it's literal life or death reasons so they didn't fight it
Oh meg ur a spy I forgot
bruh when the den keeps pushing the fuckin pickup time back
The hard life
Next year I'm going to claim COVID-19 for why I want an exemption from the dorming requirement for underclassmen
Why an apartment tho?
this is a stupid question, but do we have to buy our own wifi when we get an apartment
omg this is so stupid
wouldn't you lose financial aid if you didn't live on campus
oh wait i read your text wrong. my bad
"demonstrated need"
I just wanted to be the 300th member
Aren't a lot of upperclassmen housing on campus also apartments?
i tried to tell my parents that 🤡
I thought your parents want you to stay home as long as you can
just feels like not enough space
only my mom. dad wants me to go to campus
if u have a smaller sized apartment its probably better tho in terms of the communal spaces
my mom wanted me to go to osu so bad for that reason
id still probably rather live off campus at that point
cuz i wOuLd Be HoMe
also u dont have washer dryers in unit in the village
I saw a laundry service in south side tho
oops wrong chat
eh I'm leaving it
That looks sick
appendicitis without perforation
its the blockage of the appendiceal lumen due to lymphoid hyperplasia
Damn
Sometimes a fecalith can cause it though
@chandachan OL applications are due tomorrow by 11:59 PM right?
How can you be an OL without having lived here
🤡 last minute stuff
i'm assuming by the end of the day
tbh it doesn't sound legit LOLLLLLLL
oh
i need to grow up
bye
Good luck to everyone on the first day of classes tomorrow. Sleep well, study hard, and if you're having problems, send me a DM
Classes are really important but don't forget to floss, brush, sleep, and do some physical activity
What's wrong with PE?
we did have 2 months of it tho 🤡
how about another 2months
oh no
actually
it will miss it
i just tried with a ruler
zach's had worse
Ouw owee ouch
RIP zach 2021
now thats some hawkeye shit
One of the reasons I took a January class was because I didn't want a break
You saw nothing
Hot take: the university is reasonable in requiring PE classes since increased physical activity will lead to longer lifespans and improved quality of life for alumni which is a desirable outcome
but i dont wanna do physical activity
@_frostyyyyy_ just aint gonna work with corona lmfao
Better yet, go to the naval academy. I've heard they have mandatory daily exercise
@everyone go to sleep
@everyone go to sleep
@everyone wake up it’s time for school
I'm awake
I’m so upset I woke up naturally at 8 but my first class is at 12
for some reason I woke up at 7
but I was able to sort of go back to sleep
@chandachan OMG R U ON CAMPUS?
we'll see meg, they didnt last semester, but we'll see when the cases counts come out
we kinda got saved by the bell last sem
~~say cameron, we're not spoiled 121 people anymore~~
yeah ik they didnt last sem but there are so many more ppl on campus rn
ppl who havent seen other college ppl in almost a year, want things to be back to normal now that they are here
it only hurts when I laugh
wasn't sure
damn
missed my 1st class today
I thought that I would only have to wake up at 8 CST this semester but one of my professors has office hours at 8:30 AM EST so it looks like I'm actually going to start waking up at 7 AM CST instead
Oh someone sent the server link in the 300 person bio 215 class groupme
i dont
My dog stonks, but I do not have stonks
My mom literally forgot and lost her password and id for a bitcoin account
We havent been able to access, although she might have very little really cause she used most of it before forgetting it
This guy forgot the password for his account worth $240 million and if he gets it wrong two more times he loses it forever
She had bitcoin early on, cause sending me money through bitcoin was the cheapest way to get money abroad for me, like 4 hears ago, not even to invest
I thought you took a plane there
still probably go w someone tho if u can
RTA is ok
as long as u don't have a lady who calls u a bitch for making eye contact with her
we didnt get to see this legendary moment
corn starch is actually food tho
Got the vibe public transport there is eitther very  unsafe or u guys just never take it
ok but you are not supposed to eat it in chunks
Just hope u dont run over some kids
We arent 1920s chicago lol
Just dont insult the godfather while going throught little italy
not yet
there was a sign that said closed, maybe it was wrong
Don’t think there are many people who don’t want public transport, just need it to b fixed
only to find out that i have clinical orientation on thursday at 7am even tho normally clinical starts at 8 and now i want to kill someone
we need to once again look at europe
she advocated for the students giving flu shots at clinics
We need to be weeb once again and look at japan too
I want Kinney to be my teacher for every class for the rest of my life I think
not drew tho
I ate my ipoke bowl like an hour ago I’m considering that both my lunch and dinner
even tho i understand its like a bowl of food
and i now want to go bowling
Im shit at it but love bowling
i went last year before school started
corner alley spensive tho
plus may b closed
Cleaning everything would be hell
It was already hell before rona
*hint, they didnt clean all that well*
idk how old u guys are
no u dont
and people washing their hands after leaving the bathroom instead of just dipping
i dont remember what this place was called i went there a year and a half ago
smh my head
There can’t be thaaaat many bowling alleys round here
vaccine doesnt mean u can do whatever tho
But I would feel a bit safer doing shit like bowling with than without
rip textbook drive
Real rip hours
there's another one
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1D0lWG3YcERIdeKy1Zf-zgqFIAO5liA2G
sorry, I have a class on Monday and Wednesday from 4:50 to 6:05 PM
Its been soo long since ive eaten one
I thought it was a salad bar today omg
Theyre serving freaking shawarmas
If I had known I wouldn’t have spent my money on lunchdinner 😭
Aw man
Do nursing students tend to have a lot of professors teach multiple classes? I don't expect to have a professor who teaches me for more than 2 courses
It seems like some classes cover 2 semesters
Has anybody gotten any surveillance testing emails yet? Last semester they would normally be sent out by now, and I was under the impression everyone would be tested once per week. Slightly concerning.
I haven't personally
I really hope they do the surveillance tests though
yeah, it looks like a lot of my previous surveillance testing emails were sent by Monday afternoon at latest. I haven't heard anything so far.
Yup, very concerning we haven't heard anything yet. A lot of information from admin (like financial shit, move-in, etc) has been delayed lately, which is annoying, but this is dangerous.
I was under the impression we were supposed to sign ourselves up for testing appointments?
without the need to an email telling us?
Don’t they do it in blocks so everyone’s not signing up at the same time
the more people dont listen the higher chance there is at everyone going home
cuz college students never listen
oh ya forgot once anyone sees a single snowflake all the idiots decide to go driving
Bye !
i feel like you guys will make it to the end of the semester by a hairline
i don't think we will lol
I have no other option than to go tomorrow because I just moved in today
i don't think so either but i'd be sad for you guys. except for the ones who broke protocol ofc
damn
I know dozens of them, you're only partially wrong
Fuck you
finn why do u hate microsoft dads
nah they show you your diploma but rip it in half and give you one of the halves
dang someone's upset
granted that was a solid 8 years ago but still
i miss 2012
when the world was supposed to end but we survived np
fair
I'd say the biggest first world problem is how most tech companies are moving remote, cause then "bring your kid to work day" isn't a giant party with free shit and amazing food, but it's just staring at a computer screen
Someone made a point that remote learning reduces the chance that kids get a snow day which made me so sad
my sister got a snow day today and i didn't >:(
you must hate having fun
rip
office environments do be kinda sad
yea CS isn't for most ppl lol
Howdy, my dad knew he wanted to do that job ever since he was a small child
@chandachan stop mentioning me and then deleting the messages holy shit that’s so annoying
i would take away ur ability to ping zhanda if it wasn’t so fucked up
@sar.hh without freedom of annoyance youd kill me
i’m this close adam
i wish you lived above me so we could like install a fireman pole
I know what college you go to
oh fucc oh shit
It's so cold outside
really ?
explan tho?
we could like drill a hole in the floor and go up and down that’d be sick man
bye
if nobody hears from @addat in 5 minutes assume he froze to death
I don’t wanna brave the cold
i was first tho
THIS MAN WENT OUT INTO THE COLD
i ate it
Damn it be like that
SORRY
￼I’m in a meeting so I couldn’t get one myself :/
I would’ve just snatched a cookie and ran I don’t need to be in the cold LMAOO
is everyone gone already
I'm outside Leutner
5 mins?
Damn i can't keep you out in the cold
okqy i'm leaving the dorm right now because I had to get dressed up
Damn wtf
that would mean i would have to go outside, havent you heard of the joys of indoors
I think I contracted some STDs from the cold
Zach I actually want to be in California with you
okay ill cut back to only having 9 people at my covid parties instead of 10🙄
Rather than stay in this inclement Ohio weather
sad
Actually.my.sword can't stay up for long
Someone quote this before he deletes it
It's too cold
It's too cold
It only feels like 14
I will kill you
@zackt7718 ok cali sucks too
did u ever leave the shitty part of portland or nah
Idk I’m just shitposting LMFAO
Arkansas is literally the worst state
not the worst
Arkansas has jack shit
i honestly cant believe that anyone would voluntarily live outside of washington state
i honestly cant believe that anyone would voluntarily ~~live outside of washington state~~ choose to attend college in ohio
i mean fair, but tbf the reason we came wasnt for the state itself
One of my friends went to Montana after MS and I’ve never heard from him again
It’s a government conspiracy to test chemicals on people stay woke
thats what happens when someone moves away in middle school
fair point
that literally happened to me but instead of moving across the country he literally moved like 2 hours away
Fuck you West Virginia ur next
suck it
ohio doesn't have any of that
the thing is the way mormons work they dont actually bother you
wtf is a jazz game
Cincinnati sucks
that's sad
ye, cinci is much worse
arent we the richest country ever :thonk:
idk
tho it used to be i think
Sorry
I'm in my phone
hes stupid
I type normally on my computer
terrible towel
I don't actually go to the city very often
i went to high school with someone who goes there who now drunk tweets on the daily
I applied to Case because I didn't want to go to Pitt or Penn State
shakers are the ones that are gonna die out in like 10 years
there were a few mormons at my school
I think I can, but I don't know if I want to
I do not want to type that
Both of my classes are already behind schedule 🤡
Tuesday & thursday mornings are gonna be lit tho. 3 math classes in a row separated by only 15 minutes
I technically have three math classes this semester but that includes the January calculus 3
@zacharious 's three consecutive math classes puts my schedule to shame
lmao it's not that bad
i wanna go back to doing nothing
@chandachan What else are you taking besides MATH 228?
engr 145 isn't bad
EMAC 125, EMAC 270, Math 122, Physics 121 and some sages class
ayyyy math 122 and phys 121
oH
I'm going to withhold judgment on Kernan's teaching because, well, he didn't do much of it today
i feel sorry for remote students
their vision will be distorted
Why, what happened?
he kept walking left and right
and the cam obviously followed him
Jenin are you gonna change your name since it's no longer January
ope it's not jan anymore
i have hardly taken high school phys tho
i need this class
sorry i no big brain
Seriously
seriously seriously
oh
I did take physics tho
i won't say whether or not i like phys yet
i have to learn some of it first 💀
Seriously, 7+ hours of sleep is critical for your health
There's a piano in Tink, which is close to a library
Isn't the Steinway the Stradivarius' piano counterpart ?
Nooooo not even close
Yeah cuz strads are much older
Steinways aren't nearly as rare as a Stradivarius, but they are both top tier instruments
it is used a bit often tho iirc
the person who works there told us
i want the Japanese ogre to be mine
all of zachs are big brain tho :D
WHAT THE FUCK AHHAAHAH
time to try to not fail tmw
math
the substitution should not be too hard tbh
like the mpod for today took me like an hour and a half to do at lik 3 but rn I did it in like 10 minutes
i need sleep
Aww my schedule makes a heart ❤️
I think I didn't do a single trigonometric substitution in MATH 223 now that I think about it
won't survive without it
Never have a class before 9:30 and the latest I’m done at is 12:30
I, on the other hand, have to wake up at 8 EST for office hours and my last class finishes at like 5:15
You poor soul lmfao
Unfortunately part of this gang
WRONG GIF
you do not want to know what it said
cause dora literally teaches u spanish
thats like saying "we need need lessons because we have lessons"
tbf 
nobel's has office hours in it
and zach's labs are------ ask him
Someone save me please
I don’t have their number
Yeah I might but that’s a lot of work cause they’re a floor above
There doesn’t seem to be one for my dorm
Oh it stopped
I am now slightly less sad
Fuck it’s back on holy fuck
If it’s still on when I’m tryna sleep I’ll go up and yell at them ig
idk
ok back to math
What do u need to study for
On the first day? Wtf
U have a class that meets Monday and Tuesday?
If somebody dared blast music in my dorm at 1:25 am they would be getting very familiar with the conduct office
I wish u were my RA 😭
So if anyone wants to make one for february
Damn
I was close
smh my head

why cant we cancel classes
i dont wanna take quizes on the 2nd day

Has a patchy beard, poor social skills, starts awkward conversations that aren't important, basically loves keanu reeves big chungus wholesome 100
when the professor doesn't know how to use zoom, so they don't give the students the password and email the class why no one has joined the lecture yet
bruh i'm late
To the math recitation?
i was not *that* late
I desperately want a nap
Pain
bruh i still can't get into this zoom meeting
rip zach
I'm also late to my recitation
Idc if you don’t☺️
That's p weird tho dude
idk if i have ever been more confused in a math class before
Was it a bad lecture or a good lecture just hard material
I couldn't keep up
Why does my sages class want me to write about my childhood that I do not even remember
feeling this riiight nowww
I checked the textbook and it turns out my professor's entire lecture was straight up just quickly going through a section of the textbook and deriving shit
If anyone want some of megs cupcakes come to cutter else I'm leaving them for cutter people
Meg hasn't delivered just yet. If you want some I can wait around. Maybe 10 min?
Aw rip I won’t be back in 10
Damn @fim

No like seriously the cookies are going in now if you want one this is your chance
I guess his cousin didn't watch him

This is the mascot of a college about a 1.5 hour dive from my hometown:

https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.I0XvtF2FLUNJthTvwM1degHaFf&pid=Api
Unfortunately that was just a loud white jock in a very bad indian headdresses
trying, it doesnt seem to like it
no upload the gif
Kind of a stupid animal to grow a shell and then let the delicious part of you be fleshy and exposed
zach's towns got nothing on cleveland
I don't watch baseball
mariners suck
cant forget spartan or bulldog
my school had antelope
and thanks for everyone's hard work with the logo
This mascot looks like it was taken straight out of runescape
oh the icon for the server is adorable
Spent many a day in celina
I got an hour of sleep yesterday so I crashed after I ate
@_frostyyyyy_ is already asleep
Reminder to get 7+ hours of sleep a day
I couldn’t sleep but then I had work early in the morning so I had to get up
@sircloutius I forgot your name
I'm not asleep yet
I have work at 7:45 every morning, I just go the hell to bed
I have to wake up at 7 CST for office hours 💀
Oh shit I am sorry
Just ✨don’t go✨
RIP PST
Zach has to get up at 5 for office hours
Not really an option when the textbook is like 150 pages and doesn't really explain how to do some of the homework
Yeah I must, I normally get tired at 12 am and go to sleep when school is a thing but I’ve been extra anxious this week so that hasn’t been happening and I’ve been getting really hyper late at night
That's like me saying "I have to go to work at 4:45 PST uwu 😭"
when you go to sleep at 1 AM PST the night before an exam
I'm going to go to sleep within an hour
This stuff is literally the bread and butter of my job so lmk if you want some referrals and other stuff
Man goes to bed but jumps out of the bed when a fire on the plane forces a crash landing
I think we need to attach a disclaimer to every message Zhanda says
This is not wrong
Why have I heard more activity outside my door now than all day when it’s dead silence @chandachan
Yeah someone in my suite invited a bunch of people over
You need to put one of those car scenter things in your trousers then because damn kid
LMAO it's not that bad
Zhanda do you need to seek medical intervention?
He’s trying to help you
But if he needs it
But under what extenuating medical circumstances would anyone need a fecal transplant
Colon problems
It can resolve severe constipation, diarrhea, issues due to powerful antibiotics
Zach I can imagine you working at the UH gastroenterology department
working at?
That truly sounds awful
We want to see you become successful\
It seems to give Zach priority over zhanda
But when you go to sleep, does the cologne smother you
sorry henry @sircloutius
Can't be bothered, sorry, maybe this summer lol
What happened to the server icon
Oh yes it'll certainly be a pain
That took well over 50 hours
Sorry if I have to pay for it that's a no deal
I think I'm too stupid to use python
Still doesn't stop it from being proprietary software
or some weird sappy shit like that
Is it too late to make a version 1.1 of the logo? I have a few small improvements I want to make tomorrow
imagine working
the blue crimson fellow left after zhanda pinged him 💀
“Is this seat taken?”
Gonna be feeling it
or else i wont be able to start working for like another month : )
@BlueCrimson come back sorry
We are jealous
I've tried and petitioned @howdy_. multiple times, he won't give me mod smh
he wants all the power to himself
jenin in discord during class tsk tsk
i am hungry
Hi hungry, how are you

gimme 2 mins
I thought jolly opens at 3 tho

That's without a double major
Oh really? 💀
You need 20 CS + Calc I-III, Linear Algebra, Stats or Probability. This is for the BS though which doesn't apply to you
That means I need to average about 3 STEM classes a semester 🤡
IT actually sounds bad but it's not as bad
It's just not all CSDS or MATH
The CSDS requirements allow for a surprisingly high amount of math if one prefers that
For example, I could take MATH 303, MATH 224, MATH 330, MATH 408, etc. which would all count
gone
dead
Couldn’t be me
it wasn’t that tho 😦
also floormate probably got it from the airport
big sad
I mean you were.talking about missing parties last year
yes because we are missing parties rn but I’m not stupid enough to be stupid with the pandemic lol
Shit I’m waiting for my result now😬😬
oh
couldn't be me
Man i was so worried
I must be one of the only people who hasn't gotten tested
Never
I don't travel and I only go outside to exercise where there aren't many people so I'm at very low risk of getting it right now
I want to get a vaccine but in my city right now vaccines are restricted and only for people 65+, healthcare workers, or that have a condition
Got tested today cuz I'll need to make sure I'm clear. Might TA a lab section for circuits this spring.
I forgot it twice on the same day
I haven't had a milk shake since August of 2020
I remember specifically the last time that I had a milkshake because I ate a milkshake everyday for like two weeks after getting four of my teeth removed
aww
rip
im bored
but i dont want to do anything
alas, i don't
I actually misrepresented what I meant earlier, it wasn't liquid diet for two weeks, it was liquid diet for several days and then soft diet for like 10 days after that
Still not very enjoyable
I didn't grow the bottom wisdom teeth, kinda weird i read nce that peopoe born recently are less likely to be born with wisdom teeth
im unironically so jealous. i wish i cld take tht classs
you're not alone i've never been tested
tho, i should've
and some who didn't cover their noses smh
i miss my wisdom teeth sooo much 😦
i have two top wisdom teeth but haven't gotten them removed
cuz they haven't come in yet lol
oh.. uh...
uhh? did u j guess???
no i have no idea why you miss your wisdom teeth
ur full of shit
i will say tho im curious but eh, no need to share
ill pm you nd u can tell me if u wanted to know or not
lol if it's bad then i don't wanna know
alone in ur dorm room
oh too late
Wtf is going on
It seems some sort of roundabout sex ed in general :.
trust me, zhanda is wrong
when do chick flicks ever work out that way dude
I don't know why I find this hilarious
no. he. doesn't. i don't wanna say anything but he FOR A FACT does not like me
I was the dude staring from the stairs cause ur face seems super recognizable
That's what he wants you to think
Raunak is like the Spanish inquisition 

Nobody ever seems him coming
why wld he yell at you if he *didnt* like you?!?!?!
I should've gone w. winston
Winston next time I will stop by to say hi sorry I was busy eating and I was really hungry]
I wanted to see Zhanda :Thiccnos:
Because when you stare at someone and their gazes meets your, you both feel a tingling sensation along the spine
is it still open?
theres like 3 side conversations i lost track
eyo wtf
Sad
someone else test
don't abuse it
oh
aww I wanted to experiment
i don't encourage this tho
there's no point since we know what'll happen
why isn't it turned off?
it only has 5 people tho
so not bad
and all five of those people is leaving the server due to being pinged 😦
i can't i'm watching a lecture
aww
Bruh you were legit on discord during Mishas class
To be fair i was on too for a while
Why though?
in case i get a dm that i know i can't get to immediately
so i don't want to look rude
oh gotcha
I set mine to Do not Disturb bcause I don't want messages from Zhanda appearing when I show stuff on my phone to my parents
i only receive notifications if im pinged or if someone dms me
Tbh I don't want anything from this server appearing when I show my phone to my parents
why lol not everything on here is bad
i still remember the day in english class in freshman year of high school when class hadnt started yet and i was going over my intro latin vocab on quizlet and the guy next to me looked at my screen and just saw the word cum
Isn't that Daniel Craig?
I don't know who that is
@sprinkles2108 i'm disappointed
@kaori_flute is it because we didn’t get to watch anime?
This albert? Dont remove him
Jesus now that I know english I know why they are called backyardigans that was such a wtf name to pronounce in spanish
sorry
-8ball did Lin Biao really die
oh
Sorry my bot detects BS when it sees it
!find user{Zhanda, messages}
!delete_messages[1, end] 
!mallet.user./zhanda
I used 3 different languages and I don't care
or taken a class with Girvin
nothing on ratemyprofessor but my current sages kinda sucks
This is a sages class?
SAGES isn't horrible
@raunakwastaken stiry never ends
stop
Ok great because too much math will make my head explode
i don't complain
Like math
if i want to be lazy
i would say that i want sages without the writing aspect of it
I don't like writing
Also my lab is not meeting today, and so I have one more class until Monday
Labs are the worst part of stem IMO  lol
i hope y'all filled out the j term survey and said you wanted more j terms
i've always wanted to mix chemicals in the lab 😔
WE DONT HAVE TO WRITE REPORTS IN BIO
Paragraphs and paragraphs of explaining my fucking error bars
Every single graduating class in cwru history is looking at 23 and 24 and their labs and thinking about how this is the worst trade deal in history
I hate sages
we have to take biochem lab?? cuz i don't think i do as a neuro major
i could never major in chemical biology or biochemistry
i don't get how some double major with stem subjects
oh
Very very very hard professor
But very hard
@toomanyzs i get to pick tho
idt pscl 350 is offered anymore
sad
idk
i just won't take 373 or 374
So, as a neuro major, you don't want to take intro to neurobiology or neurobiology of behavior
@raunakwastaken don't forget office hours
OH SHIT. I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
i only need phys 115 and 116
Jenin I don’t even know what I’m supposed to ask
Imma ask “What are we supposed to do in this class?”
Most STEM people here only take between 2-4 math classes though
Wtf
WTF
some other non-math classes include math
WTF
What happened?
cuz we're trolls
im not joining tho
phys office hours
Zhanda and zach joined our office hour
I took CHEM 111 and the most complicated math was just a simple integral for half-life. The rest was just simple algebra
i feel sorry for the ta
a bunch of people joined
laughed
and then turned off their cam
Wtf
Wtf is happening lmaooo
Ok im taking a deep breath and gonna stop laughing
I’ll troll him so hard
Im sorry
No i just turned my camera on and started smiling
dhananjay: Ok im taking a deep breath and gonna stop laughing
zhanda: opens cam
dhanajay: laughs even harder and turns off cam
I have to attend office hours for a class
Zach has to hook me up with that patagonia fit though 👀
I didn't wear the converse today tho
Okie my questions are done and ive had my fill of laughing so im gonna leave
True, most people don't want to hear about it right now. I just wanted to post a hot take about SAGES while it was on my mind
Are shorts bad?
its just cold
im surprised youre not cold
i should really get back to work bye byeeeeeee
Jenin you won't even talk to me in person
You just stare at me and then run away
But yet screen shot
Yo wtf is happening in this class
I already did, I just wanted to see you before you realized and turned the camera off
oh lala?
Half of my face is covered with aask
You want to study together for it lmao. I have to idea what to do
I have to leave
raunak when do u wanna study
bruh we need xcrittyx
Oh physics
i dont
oh
don’t mess up Michael gabe
bruh i wish our SIs this fun
oh no we gotta yeet when that happens
lemme know when you leave
damn
Aww I wish I was part of the fun
you want the link?
@bravo5127 guess what? i still haven't downloaded matlab nor have i watched his video (couldn't find it)
is this class really that hard
it seems like a simple intro programming class that’s for some reason not python
it's a lot of work, so in that sense it's hard
it's supposed to be easy conceptually i heard
the work seems to consist of just uhh
IM LOST WHAT IS GOING ON
I feel like
a lot of my classes don’t seem hard it’s just like
I don’t know what I need to do
OH IMMA JOIN THAT ONE
i need phys :eyes2: 
but i also want matlab
even when I read and reread the syllabuses I still don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing lol
we left
yeah
imma leave tho
what I did in lecture is follow along in MATLAB, it helps a lot. lowkey didn't pay attention to most lectures because programming is boring to listen to but they for sure help to an extent
and die in isolation
study
I don’t have work
I feel like im missing shit but like I legit have nothing to do lol
implying michael gabe isn't the real professor
howdy slow
@toomanyzs He felt unappreciated and left to work for Amazon
Do the um, MATLAB tutorial that I'm sure he suggested last lecture
you don't need to have MATLAB downloaded
Dude this stock just keeps going up what is going on
Oh nvm AACG
i have stuff to do tho...
He’s a day trader who looks at trends that isn’t inside trading like what
I used to be so bad at naming variables
I accidentally turned in an assignment with all the variables named damnit1, damnit2, etc
well that could have been worse
A lot of my variables have either "thing" or "thingie" at the end
rip
most don't have their cameras on
i don't need people seeing me
I just didn’t today because I haven’t showered...
nah what you do is make every single variable a string and keep converting them back and forth whenever you need to change them
michael omg pay attention in class
Michael check out this sick code
Wtf is that
Financial Services really did me dirty
if you got the fuck out of this university we'd be ranked higher than harvard by now
The issue, Nobel, is that I don't know what a stringbuilder is
like if most instrumentation stuff is done in python and C (or labview if smol brain), and most discord bots are written in python or javascript, I'm not gonna learn Java. I'm sorry.
Yeah he's also just terrible in general. I haven't owned a pair of basketball shoes in a while so I was looking at used ones because I'm bored
His own lawyers admitted the girl was drunk to the point of blackout but he’s a rich athlete so he doesn’t get punished
Dating within the same major is scary I think
is it even a surprise these celebs/athletes/etc turn out to be vile pieces of shit?
It’s all dark chocolate I’m sorry if u don’t like 70% lol
It’s basically glorified study buddies
Study buddies who fuck lol
now i want choccy
Oooo I want donut
the main issue is that he gave her a list of demands for all sorts of petty bullshit, and made the relationship like hard classes in school with them
oh my god that sounds horrible ewww
Put your hands up in the air
Gosh even dating another nurse sounds stressful too. Just never date anyone who does the same stuff as u
what sealed the deal for her was when she visited his parents, and found out that he lost his shit at his parents for lotta petty shit all the time
just never date
omfg ew i hate when ppl are mean to their parents
Oh
sometimes i snap at them and i feel so bad afterwards
i hate it
that chick was crying when that happened
and he didnt even care about her
right i apologize right away if i feel like im being a brat
guess he just wanted a trophy wife
cuz she's hot, but at the time she didn't have much experience with guys, so she had to learn the hard way
when what happened
But sometimes they aren’t
Just start shoving ppl left and right
RIP people bagholding GME
RIP
Anyone who didn’t sell GME yet is an idiot

I don't think there's gender mixing per quad
its still there
You didn't know cameron?
never heard of it
I don't think so
zach did pierre leave
I'm looking at the roster and it seems GIC has been kind of shuffled due to covid, but it is still in cutler, just kind of spread around
bruh it's snowing hard 💀
someone on my friend's server found my instagram and started calling me celebuski for no reason
weird I didn't order a milkshake

I guess I should practice, but I can do that on there
i would do that as well if anyone wants earrape
Bruh, I lost my Duolingo streak of like 65 days 💀
I forgot to do it day before yesterday and then forgot to buy a streak freeze
and then I fell asleep accidentally yesterday
and then woke up at 1 AM to find my streak gone
except i got locked out of my roblox account bc i forgot my password, rip😔✊
i never stole it i just begged and begged
I just never bought Robux ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
rip tix
Jokes aside my brother actually almost fell for one of those scams
And for the record I pretty much never played roblox except for the random times with my friends earlier in the pandemic for irony and fun and when I was working on a Roblox game with them
I suppose those sketchy devs will need to give their gifts to someone else 😤
ngl i used to be able to NAIL the roblox oof
still can't play it on Linux
Daven I need you to take some headshots.of.me.for.20 dollars
I just feel like messing around
You said you wanted to have me directly message you so I figured since we're here this would be the most "direct"
nah i use on phone
i didn’t know u could on laptop
do you need me to buy you an extention cable so you can run your laptop charger to your bed?
nooo my plug is by my bed but my laptop gets hot on my lap
and i don’t have a thingy to set it on
or my math notebook👍
why the fuck would you bring SAT books to college
why isn't the first letter capitlaised?
maybe he wants to study more adam don’t judge
ok fair
ohhhh no i turned auto capitalization off on my phone
so it doesn’t do that anymore
cant look too professional
if she turned autocap on she would look like a *Narck*
First you have to capitalize shit right ❤️

I dunno what it is
I looked at twitter too long and went too far into the comments and now I'm furious
i know RA stands for resident assistant but i'm starting to differentiate the zacharys by making "ra" your last name
Dead chat

I'm "in" class
also meg, im gonna need about 15k vaccines, totally not for selling reasons
85+ or 75+ i dont remember
and still 1a frontfacing healthcare
ik an old couple from around here, they recently got the pfizer vaccine, and didn't feel anything unusual after the first dose
moderna has worse side efx
idk abt the uk bc i know that was found in uh
university hospital
oh damn
but i feel like the vaccine would still give some immunity
Bruh, my investments are profitable now. I lost some money  as a bear last year and I finally got back to where I started
Yeah I’m sorry Zhanda😂😂
the new wandavision holy shit
I haven’t watched today’s episode but last week’s was really good
Also easier to carry (doesn't need as low temperatures)
I was down 300 dollars at the worst and now I'm up by like 15 dollars
Oh and Zhanda didn't abuse it? smh
I haven’t even watched the pilot
dunno :xcrittyx:
nobel already uses the bot to delete messages of those he doesnt agree with
Yeah you're right, sorry
It's a civil war only if we lose
you dead then ✨😉⛓️😩🥰💫😌
It's hard to believe you were born in 2003
Damn libtards
nobel deserves it tho
he created a bot
I'm not even a mod on here
Bc I don't need extra responsbility
@mag3is didnt u just say tru mods dont ask
wish zach happy hunting
which is pain bc I wanted to play ranked video games tonight but the last time I did that while on call a kid had a seizure in the hall way
omg WHAT
Damn the Juniper RA on call is going to be pissed lmao
that's terrible
*did your subpar gaming cause reality to implode?*
Yeah, he stood up from the Table in the common room and hit his solar plexus on the corner, which caused him to pass out, and he crumpled and hit his head on the concrete floor
I dont know what half of those words mean and I know they're bad
Yeah his friends picked him up and put him on the couch and then ran and got me
I had them move him to the floor and one of them held just his head, to prevent it from smacking the ground, and let it ride it out, because you shouldn't restrain people in a clonic seizure. I called EMS and my supervisor
It wasn't a very severe seizure but it was enough that it was noticeable and scary for his friends
seizures do be scary tho
I imagine it was scary for everyone involved
i mean it dont think you just randomyl get seizures
I dont think anyone is not terrified of them
you never know
I think the severed arteries spraying blood on the ceiling and walls and floor and hallway and bathroom and kitchenette last semester was more traumatic
wtf zach
I’m sorry what
wtf was there a murder
it ususally would be diagnosed young tho, no?
yeah idk anatomy shit
People have them in response to medicines sometimes, and you can have them after a head injury like he did, but the most common source outside of epilepsy is drug and alcohol withdrawal
yeah im generally not one to hit the drugs particularly hard
shame
That's why people need to wear a fucking helmet when riding a bike
holy shit
Head injuries are so bad
Yeah I've actually been a car accident once
Have not had a seizure tho
I was getting help on my physics homework one day after school last year and another girl was there too. She had a seizure because of how stressed she was of that class
scary
omg
And her and I ended our friendship in middle school because of how rude she was and stuff to me and my family but anyway
I've been in 4 fucking car wrecks
i hate to say this but thats sorta a pattern at this point
I’ve been warned of really bad burnout does that count
I've been hit 3 times and the last time a truck on the highway lost a bunch of scrap metal off the back and it burst two of my tires and I spun out
jesus christ thats so scary
better than going thru the windsheild tho
Some people don’t deserve a license fr
zach, are you sure you havent been brushing w/ death al la final destination?
Thankfully it was really late at night so there weren't many people, out
Fair
I wasn't the only one; like 4 cars and a semi all got their tires nae naed
Like a Ford F350 work truck
The first one was my dad and I got rear ended by a kid when he was on his phone when my dad was taking me to school in like 9th grade
*palestine wants to know your location*
That shouldn't be a problem; we just have never really invested in transportation so now we're suffering
Pete Buttigieg just said that he wants to make America the leader in HSR
*however, that would allow the lowerclass to move around, and we cant have that"
-government, aftering being lobbyed
The second was somebody went the wrong way through a roundabout and hit me
True, but that really isn't public trans- oh I didn't specify, I meant public transportation
I live in Texas and there's been talk of HSR between the big cities here for a while but it seems to not have led anywhere
The third was on I-71 going to Akron to see my uncle and a truck was taking an off-ramp really slowly so I slowed down, as did everyone else, and then some dickhead hit the car behind me, pushing that car into me
Nobody wants to fund it, it's also pretty expensive
Tis a shame
Too bad they're unlivably hot
we need to inovate
California had something in the works as well, but that was back in 2008 and it's apparently supposed to be finished in 2030
Building high speed rail simply isn't efficient in the US
i feel like you can’t survive in America without a car
once you have car culture
u get stuck in it
Also there's problems around eminent domain probably
European cities are more built towards pedestrian traffic and public transport, in the US you can't get anywhere without a car
Theres no way this could fail
Dr fauci could never
Shit sorry Naruto😅
Damn baby steps towards profit
ppl who dont use discord
Is my journey still not working?
@syberkonda actually you can go to the student advancement team's drop in office hours every weekday from.9am to 5pm

Oh sorry
I'm surprised that I don't know any other Davids here since it is a common name
but it says it isn't
you're wrong
you arent here
BYE!
Welp the house that stands directly across my middle school caught on fire
god damn @sprinkles2108

It was so scary
@srk.1 if you want a piece of advice for this server, never listen to anything @chandachan ever says
@srk.1 Don't enter into any sort of conversation with @.fim. because he will start to become microaggressive
@srk.1 fair warning this server can get weird
i will kill you
He tried to sneak attack me in the Sherman restroom
no u dont zhandy
Oh
fim fams basically the opposite of me, he takes shit too seriously while i find shit in general to be funny
i cant tell if ur being serious but i take almost nothin seriously
this is incredibly ironic because it seems like youre just taking what *I* say what too seriously
wait how did you know that wtf u arent even in this building
@srk.1 oh yeah also zhandy likes to delete his messages for no reason its really annoying
Rip Roman's stream, it was good while it lasted

The app crashed when I needed it and when it came back the shuttle already passed me smh
Too cold for shuttle apps to fail
I debated using one of my disposable heat packs, but did not want to waste the precious materials
Have an unopened pack of 24, and 3 shitty ones I took from my last hospital trip
Hospital heat packs suck

Sell half my stash at a high enough price to buy myself another box
Well we all aint nurses

I have tried a sims, but then got tired of constantly taking care of the kids so I quit
Two working parents and two kids I thought maybe I should let child services take them away then start over
But then I realized people do this every day n got sad
I also tried portal 2
But then I didn’t
I got so sad at witnessing sims4 life sims5 life is just depression
I also tried Minecraft but then I remembered last time I played I almost died in full iron by silverfish and then logged out
So why hasn’t the government shut down ea then smh
Cuz the government is also stuck in the simulation
Omg
Also upset that I hit bedrock and haven’t found any diamond
Fucking
I dug so many veins this is so sad
I feel like I probably hit 12 but heard zombies so kept digging lol
U gotta kill the zombies
Scary tho
Its xyz isnt it
Math has corrupted me
We must ban math
especially cause we were allowed to do the final in mc if we wanted
i used to hate redstone but ive come to love it
First lava waterfall tried to murder me, then actual waterfall
It’s telling me not to go outside when it snows
just dont look at it
But what if I did and I don’t kno until I die?
i looked into it and i have no idea why i even got an email ab it bc freshies r just not even eligible to apply lmao
And look at them as long as you want
They get hurt when they step on it
i mean no bc they could teleport inside ur house
But you should kill the endermen for enderpearls
Also they can be used for making eyes of ender which can lead you to the end
rip spammy bois
But theyre still used for going to the end city
You need to farm end pearls
Than the end
nether update tho
Yeah it looks sick as hell
Idk
Wow I can’t belief
rip
oh piglin brutes suck
theyre annoying
but.... if ron couldnt pvp...... why go into a bastion.......
i guess

Howdy is trying to make me into gamer

smoking in a car
no ventilation so smoke doesnt get out
I shouldn’t have searched it up

just look at the records when they want
did someone smoke k2?
Wrong ref
im gonna pretend like i didnt read that zach
Rip

Math rocc
I want to yeet myself into tan(90)
math literally sucks

no feeling
when u need a fecal transplant u need someone elses poop
flip the switch from blow to suck
so reverse poop woukd not work
why would one need someone's poop bacteria
Bad colon
if u have something wrong w ur gut bacteria
u get poop from someone u are close with and spend a lot of time w bc they r more likely to have a similar micriobiome to u
I need the emeralds
what do u need emeralds for so bad that u cant use sticks and fletchers
u need villagers and a zombie
And die
do the golems feel pain
Oh I had all sorts of farms on my hs server
cuz it gave me yellow
Idk how to ping everyone
well
u can't
I promise it wasn’t me this time
My friend just tried to buy me a 5lb box of twizzlers
And then she didn’t laugh
But I truly felt a brush with death
think about the twizzler stonks tho
I would’ve let it go if they were wrapped but I can’t put it out like that
I would’ve McPerished but at least I would’ve died a record holder
Not urgent enough to need ambulance
Doesn’t case have it’s own ambulance or something
And also soccer boring, sleep cycle important
I am death
when you record a presentation at 6:00 am after 21 hours of no sleep and sound somewhat coherent
Kids in South Korea procrastinate on purpose to do their work in one siting
And get motivated to do work by stress
What class is this?
it's been there for 12 hours
I don't see an issue
I was VP but then I left
I don't really know her
lol I knew everyone on exec except her, she didn't show up to any exec meetings
but she showed up to the fair that day so props to her
on the Student Activities Fair
If a non pre health person joins we won’t kick you out
Anyone wants to go to ksl?
I like chess but I'm bad at it 🤡
My brother is like 1100 rating on Chess.com but I lost to him like 80 percent of the time 🤡
I'm in multiple clubs and I haven't heard any of them mention elections yet
No, they themselves told me at the activities fair last semester that they’ll be having elections since some people graduated so I should be on the lookout for information about that
Oh, I guess I should just be more patient for elections then
@sprinkles2108 do you have a position on the eye thing?
Wait wrong chat sorry
I wish
kinda? idk
are you taking part in the fair today for eye?
For student activities fair
Bruh almost nobody is participating in the fair
Yeah ik but aren't we supposed to name them or something
This student activities fair is not only sunday?
Last semester it was only 2 hours
And I couldn't get in at all
people arent joining rn
i mean i don't want either team to win so no i'm not planning to watch it
I don't even know which teams are playing
i mean, does anyone want to watch sportsball?
What does "I'm Interested" do in the student activities fair?
raunak, have u joined all the clubs yet
cuz
Is every club supposed to have a country flag? Because Poker club doesn't have it
Damn ethan you really finna leave me on red
Well they don't
Like even I don’t know
But I don’t know why
I just realized that I wasn't part of SCBC so I might join that
Fair warning it can be disorganized
Seems like every premed under the sun is in it
That hurt my feelings Nobel
You shouldn't
nobel just cant *see* the benefits
Shiny eye
Bruh what did I miss
Not me stalking the participants in the activity fair
Oh in zoom?
Too late
No the activities fair lol
Oh
No I wasn't
I was busy doing something else I forgot
Also I'm not joining the math club either
but you do nothing but math
False I don't know how you got that notion
*says the person who is taking like 5 math classes at once*
What time foes the fair finish? Isnt it 2?
I meant today cause i didnt receive anything for today
So lost
you gotta be in fs or it doesnt show
there are so many christian clubs that all seem to b dead, you would think they would combine into one or something
@_the_intern_ bro rip
Jenin's leaving me 😢
someone ping zach
There are republicans at this school?
Yeah the math club had the indian flag
sorry
i went
and dang i didn't realize i'd win
@raunakwastaken the zoom is not up yet
just sleep forever
some of us had high possibilities of dying at some point
You’re in math club???
im too dumb for math club
also i've only taken up to calc 2 so far here 🤡
the only drawback is that he doesn't have live lectures
In the math club
No I'm not in the math club nor will I ever be
I can’t unsee right now
Wtf
per nobel's request/disspointment of lack of flags, I have collected all the places without flags
Hope u this helps ur flag hunting nobel https://pastebin.com/qji8tyx1
I literally didn't do any of it yet but look at you go big brain
uh idk if i'll be on vc rn
"Please don't prop open the doors and let non-residents in the building" *Not last night where every Tyler resident invaded Norton common room*
are we actually predicting an outbreak tho
Not because of the incident last night but
cuz idt most colleges sent people home
I don't think so but we might get put in SIP again
Shelter in place doesn’t do much tho
Don’t think many people follow it
there was a vid someone made about the lockdowns n stuff, how unfair it is for those who listen, which is completely fair.
you're stuck inside while the world around you doesnt listen and parties like nothing is going on
and all it takes is one wrong cough
Dunno whether I’d find it annoying or not if they cancelled our clinicals if we did have to shelter in place
idk
what about when they combine tho?
Sorry
We need enough food items for 40 people, so help me do the shopping
Sorry
U don't need cups if everyone drinks from the same bottle ;)
I don't have anything
uh oh
im so sorry for you
It's not real money tho it's basically payment deferral
nobel is gonna make bad decisions with the plastic rectangle
there was an email about it, but i cant find it rn
It's so if you buy a book and you then drop the class you don't have to buy the book in the first place and return and get the money back
pulled pork tho
Sorry I'm with @kaori_flute in Tink studying like the good students we are
@chandachan Do you have the physics note web page? I can't find it again 🤡
Can't you just buy it in India? No?
u want to print the book?
oh LMAO u wanted to buy that :xcrittyx:
Yeah they don’t 😔
isnt that 100k
fuck you're right
In case anyone here doesn't know, multiple nuclear weapons have been lost in the past and have yet to be discovered
Maybe some people just really hates North Carolina
rip
that sucks
shouldnt u b running away from the fire
First rule of making popcorn is that you can never pop the whole@bag without starting a fire
Gets me close to the whole bag with everything burning down
i havent noticed that
when you get a near decade old bag, its very tempermental
As someone who eats popcorn once every five years
well im not dead
I used to play a lot when Tetris friends was still up
aww
damn tetris friends was the shit
oh rip
oh shit
@chandachan actually fuck u tho why did u have to implicate me too
didnt u get banned?
Oh we got banned 💀
i got fucking kicked
they don't like you calling people whores
i only got banned cause fucking zhanda
fuck u zhanda
i cant tell if u actually think that or ur just being annoying for no reason now
i didnt say it was a serious issue
im sorry i cant
y'all really need some practice jeez
we did nothing wrong its just that zhanda sabatoged us and especially me cause he takes jokes too far on discord
Idk wtf I got banned 4
I didn't say a word howdy
well that alone makes sense
don't commit blasphemy against the buckeyes
o damn
i am sorry zach
i dont understand why thats bad
Discord idk
Boring without u
JE9 is boring me
sorry i'm boring
Jenin is actually pronounced Yeh- nine so she didn’t tell us we were all pronouncing it wrong
i hate cs
raunak i hate you
@raunakwastaken sucks
sorry about that
Dad will be home in 2 hours
Sorry about what?
Gonna study more tonight :cri:
Okay I'm going to upload a series of screenshots of the different instructions that I'm to be following for the same damn thing and I am very frustrated
THESE ARE ALL FOR THE SAME CLASS
and i thought phys and engr was bad
im kinda scared for my later classes soph-senior year
imma cry
I can't wait to take graduate level math classes 🥲
~~im scared for my UNDERGRAD classes~~
when david is secretly a math major at heart
I'm not interested in things like analysis. I do like some areas of math but I don't want to major in it.
Some people (like engineers) just have to take a lot of math classes
I think I'll do 7-8 math classes by the end
My current plan: MATH 121, 122, 223, 303, 307, 380, 408. Maybe 224 too
If I get permission from the math department to count my local college's diff eq class as MATH 224 then I'm going to take it this summer
I don't know why I'm going to do this
really slow internet lately
wtf this game
what makes it actually 5d tho
the 5th dimension is the height of the pieces and isn't used
I guess if you count the knight jumping over pieces it's 5d though
228 with Izen is an actually challenging class but I hear its good if you really are into math
oh my goodness
We have 1700 staff computers alone, in addition to all the students now using zoom all day
it feels like its gotten worse over the past couple days tho for some reason
it was for me at first but its gotten worse recently
damn
idk what that is
I think the Dental School, HEC, the HPC
It better be good we ain’t paying all that money for bad WiFi
case ethernet tho
Never mind I'm a genius and I figured out this thing that was annoying
Watch me be wrong af tomorrow when he asks about it
and lose 35 points
Sorry
it do be workin tho
just cuz of the glow
>Spends 3 hours making an intricate productivity system
>Doing so to procrastinate working
don't judge
It's near quiet hours
Zach lost his voice yelling at people to enforce guidelines
i mean i technically don't have stuff due tomorrow
15 mins per class reviewing per day will help
I never had to do aleks
He's not, and the remote is hard bc of how many people he has to teach
Whatever keeps you out of wade lagoon
and deal with people dying
idk if its likely
Because it makes 750 k and you work 9-4 Mon-Thurs
"I want to be rich and not work as much as other people:
Sounds like you have brain problems
@sprinkles2108 you are doing it for the money
@toomanyzs why do you assume that im going into medicine and considering ophtho JUST for the money
If I hear one more wrong thing I'm going to unmute
cuz heathcare steals all ur money
SAY MORE WRONG THINGS
This coming from the man who fell into wade lagoon
you need a brain ~~trans~~plant
he didn't need a nurse
i find them fascinating
vast majority of eye problems are related to neuro issues
i had p bad experiences w my eyes growing up so i have a personal connection to the field
oh damn
what happened with ur eyes?
Zhanda is going to give ppl something worse than covid
ah, my left eye's quite nearsighted
meg i fell into wade lagoon and didn't need help
you guys don't distill your pee?
how do u manage to fall into a lagoon and claim 'i dont need help'
"help i've fallen and I cant get up"
well too bad priyanka
damn LOL
imagine still being in high school lmaooooo grow up
im on a gap year bitch
I don't need a nurse to circle circle dot dot that shit
My brain when I went to lecture and the professor doesn't record the zoom but says things you need to know
ima go bang on adams door
Trying desperately to study
tendies run has been postponed? this is heart breaking news.
i need time to mourn
OH WHAT
pain💔
i’m so sorry for ur loss adam
see this is why my sat reading score is so bad
close reading? dont kno wher
shit bro that's fancy
Didn't you gift him nitro?
you dont have the powers of guessing the covid cases
How many tomorrow?
what was it last week
Damn why so many people studying at 12:17 AM
Damn
RIP tendies run 🙏 🙏 🙏
Tendies run got postponed by a freaking year??
you know what else is dead to me?
look i get locking away features for premium users
restore backup should never EVER be a premium function
fuck you notion
i had to pay 5 dollars to get my shit back
i'm moving back to onenote
idk when you're held hostage by someone you change your opinions about your captor quick
The sons of the american revolution cannot afford to lose a member as precious as you
How many people forgot to get tested last week though
Isn't testing mandatory?
Well it *is* but some people don't do it
Tbf we had almost the same amount of tests this week as we did last week, Zach. Which comes as a surprise for me.
imagine getting tested for a virus that's taken over the world for like a year. couldn't be me
But nobel, I saw your point about how the graph doesn't make sense and I too am confused
They didn't make sense last week but we didn't catch it
ugh, that's frustrating. Someone should prolly email because they've fucked things like this up before.
Yeah but no matter how you slice it, it doesn't make sense
^^from last week, they added wrong again too
idk man this shit is fishy
But also the cold keeps the coronasweat basketball game gone
Also looking at the "+/- New Positive Cases Over Week Prior," seems like -13 is the difference between week of 4-10 and 11-17 (which they reported for this week) and +1 is the difference between week 11-17 and 18-24 (which they reported for last week
Seems like they're going backwards?
Those numbers are only reflective of week to week testing, the cumulative is really most likely and under estimation
Well I know of course that the real numbers are probably much higher but the fact of the matter is that I can't understand the figures they're presenting
We're on slow mode with 1hr timeframes between messages so I need to reply here. @_frostyyyyy_ Yes you need to complete the masterclass if you're joining the Review team. There's 4 teams, and review is one of them.
I shouldn't say 4, it's really 3.
nope ur already in ^^
@moseslee restoring data/backing shit up should be a basic feature, not DLC
but everything is broken apart
yeah u mentioned that, it's a shit tier way to run
also the cut and paste and undo functions are not reliable
*falls to near zero within two hours*
Staying away from GME, AMC And DOGE with a 10 foot pole
thats all u need to kno
red bad
when people want it
thats not actually a meaningful difference because they both have it set up so the more that gets mined, the harder it is to mine more, so whether or not there's a hard cap doesnt really matter
I still can't believe that Dogecoin is mainstream now
idk if its quite mainstream yet
idk how much doge is actually traded
And it still hasn’t even hit their goal of 10 cents
I didn't trade AMC or GME because I know I would have horrible timing
Lmaoo finn I didnt realize you were in my math class
lost my stylus :FeelsBadMan:
holy shit
I've been missing my stylus for a day
instantly find it
rip
@inexorablesalmon 4 hours for the Nature masterclass isn't short imo
hell yeah that's the shit
generally id assume its cuz hes familiar w the math
https://youtu.be/KwEKeG3qYvE this is what my mind's like when learning shit
lol mindmate left
idk why
i just saw that he left
im getting lotta insurance agency shit in mine
i wish they would give me grants over loans 😔
i will offer you a grant that will cover all ur college expenses plus 500 dollars a month stipend i just need you to venmo me a 80$ application fee
sure, but to access my money and get you the $80 I need some cash to unlock the account. Just send 0.005 to my bitcoin wallet and expect a full reimbursement and the application fee payment within a week.
anyone know what happens if you dont do the daily health asssessments?
i didnt do it for several days in a row and nothing happened
u have to fill even if u are feeling fine
you're keeping track of how you feel
yeah but if i dont have symptoms then theres no point in checking
just do it takes 30 secs :')
u have a # on your card if that is what u mean
oh i forgot that was an actually person here
Just because there are no consequences administered by case, doesnt mean i cant make my own
Despite all the stress we are going though with academics, mental health, finances, etc, it is still 100% necessary that every day we stop and think to ask ourselves the question, "am I showing symptoms today?" Even if case isn't actually enforcing this, you should still be doing it out of courtesy for others and for your own health.
im dying
i dont get released
wow, I'm sorry to hear that. No sink?
dont trust it, black shit coming out
or was not anymore but still
im just complaining its not too bad ^_^
except the food is pretty bad
but other than that not too bad
that sounds bad
yee ive spent too much money on grubhub :/
oh then they test you?
floormate was + so 10 of us got sent to quarantine and none of us have it except him
rip
nose got violated
rip
Can't risk anything rn
the cop lady who transported me got mad because i had so much shit but i had to otherwise it was all gonna go bad xd
Not Me bringing my microwave, fridge, freezer, all my school shit, a monitor, a tv, my ps4, etc
uhhh do you still need it cuz we're both here
oh
I'm stupid
I went to Dunkin’ and they said I finished my swipes for the week which is literally not allowed cz I can’t use more than 4 swipes a day so has this happened to anyone else and what did you do?
I checked my transaction thing and I’ve only used 6 this week so far
I haven’t
I went to Dunkin once this week so far
> I checked my transaction thing and I’ve only used 6 this week

> I went to Dunkin once this week so far

:thonk:
Idk I’m just gonna assume something happened and go get something else lmaoo
Oh Dunkin’ is a portable swipe nvm she just confirmed
they count towards the overall swipes tho
u have 14 swipes left
bc u used them all
Wow I didn’t know that
i literally never even got close to running out of swipes so it was never a big deal for me but yea
so idk how that would work
oh is it 7 now
Idk I might be wrong
bc i didnt need it
that's fair
thats the only thing im missing out from the meal plan
Idk what's with jolly but they decided to hit this year
My stomach can’t handle the den everyday
ive gotten a bite from the den on a few occasions when studying with a bud, its not bad but not rly a daily meal for me either
How tired are you
Did/When did you go to sleep last night?
rip howdy
Only LIBTARDS don’t like Denny’s
Charlie Kirk has nothing on me
i dont like em puttin chemicals in the water
@zackt7718 oh shit u got more
that definitely can’t be topped
cant forget when ben shapiro hosted meme review
depends on who tho. some could want the extra special swipes lol
also let's say the meal plane was $3k (idk the exact price). an extra $80 is a 2.7% increase of the cost, which doesn't seem like much
but people can decide their meal plans however they want to, im just explaining my perspective
I dont think anyone wants to use the meal plan at that point
we're just stuck with it rn
and a shit ton of food
i mean, since you still wont b on campus at that point, probably would work
uhhhhh do i study for my physics exam or make a burrito hmmmmmmmmmm
I'm planning to get an apartment if I don't get the financial aid I want
then u begin to associate physics shit with burritos
so u can use that to remember shit on exams
@halcyon6561damn where did you get the money to go to chipotle every day ?
i did landscaping work last spring so i have some cash lul
didn't he lose his intelligence though
@samrobot at the end
i think it was something like dementia, but it happened much, much faster
Buying meals individually should still be cheaper
last last fall i went there every other day
grew huge off plenty of food tho so that was sick
i also just dont like the food in the dining halls soooo
because regardless of food quality, ppl still go there
Can’t do that on daylight
This reminds me that I have my Econ class in 10mins
i'm not saying that's wrong. i'm saying think about this using slopes...
The quality also doesn't matter since everyone is forced to buy the meal plan
even with slopes it would still be an inelastic curve
cuz the price could skyrocket
Yes. Today I tried sleeping early but couldn’t before 5:30am
rip i forgot price is y
Damn wtf is going on
ECON class?
We're trying to explain why Leutner is so bad
I have my Econ class now. Damn quiz already?
that's why its easier to gyp ppl outta their shit so they can get that something
i love econ i wish i could minor in it
ugh
Inelastic is where the two bodies stick together after collision and elastic is where no energy is lost during collision
that's fair
And physics boils down to math
A lot of econ is just math at the graduate level
Damn
thats the shit im finna learn
1+1 is the foundation for everything. This is also the only thing I understand in maths
guess with high lvl math
10 Pancakes 10 pushups 10 algebra problems
Really?
Kill
i tried to reply to @halcyon6561 but it wouldnt let me
I’m disappointed halcyon
It’s just that I did a lot of shit with Fibonacci series in comp sci in my high school
recursive shit is both fun and mindfuckery
Econ class rn. Yeet
I hate notion
case doesnt have a single chad
@_frostyyyyy_ ye i take my shit down on paper as well, i remember shit better
You don’t go to Case anymore?
but u feel physical paper lmao
im trying it for my to-do list only
Fair
OSU people still have to write free-body diagrams
and that's why i use a google doc to keep a to do list, cuz then im typing out everything i need to do, so im actively thinking about them
never
Oh what really?
ig you can also make an argument for typing out notes too, tho that doesn't help much
i mean when will i ever need physics in my profession
i likely won't
fair
cuz fourier shits
This is some Christopher Nolan crap
This isn't a vocational school though, physics is important for understanding the universe
Cuz you know
who cares about exams
Grad schools want to see 95th percentile GRE quant for PhDs in STEM
99th percentile is ideal though
reject exam, return to fishe
i b broke
If you don't invest then your savings actually lose value
If you invest $1000 a month in the S&P 500 and it follows its historical pattern of 7 percent return a year, that could grow to a million dollars within 30 years
thats lame
i'll b dead by then
we need stonks now
using dum shit
Not hard using market trends
Won’t always win but you win more than you lose :Thiccnos:
what if tho
That’s helping Wall Street though
Fuck Wall Street
fuck wall street, all my homies hate wall street
how that work
you likely won't be dead
Trends point to it being 4 short and 8-9 long term 

Anything under 3 was free and it dipped to 2.78 this morning because idiots panic sold
@kaori_flute wow you really did leave me
I haven't had subway in a while
I thought u left :p
I’m running to Tomlinson and I’m thinking about taking sages there
Where r u
As i walk out with cold subway, i could def go for that if its warm
i live 5 minutes away from a subway anyway
i wish the prelab was like this
ur not dumb u just didn't study enough
don't you have class right now
you and Nobel still stalking each other
bruh i dunno what y'all are doing
ik u and nobel went back
What is a "noble?" I don't know any "noble"
last time was a mistake
to do what i think i want to do i need a doctorate
I don’t think I’m bold enough to do more than a Masters, I hate academia
Don't a lot of PhD students get stipends/be TAs and that covers everything?
for yaknow, a lot of fucking money
Aw there was a thing I saw
Oh oops it’s for phds
even w the 20% grant the cost is still ||$125k||
Case should die maybe
Dunno how useful that is
not trying for phd, dnp
Oh shit I forgot ab the difference between doctorate and dnp
Oh icic
What are you trying to do that requires Uber high education?
damn crnas rly make bank huh
End goal is pediatric acute NP but if I don’t make it that far I’ll survive
having to get thru school when u arent making that much money is not easy
wuahhh
i have not looked at it yet bcz im planning to study sth else
can we do it tonight?
I would rather have higher taxes when I already have the security of a high paying job instead of getting in high debt while unsure of whether I'm able to get a job or even conclude college
Holy fuck
zhanda getting door bell ditched
@_the_intern_ Also Winston I just happened to see that status on your discord
oh lala ksl
I might need you to smuggle a few textbooks or so in the semesters to come you feel me 👀
"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I cannot do that" 😔

Who keeps posting
Ok looks like he isn’t

I just want to make it clear it’s not about him supporting trump
moses, you clearly havent been around long enough to know about facts and logic
I can’t
A shame I didn’t screenshot any of the stories on January 6th
Ok now he seems to be focussed on clowning the Steelers
Idk i don’t know the guy at all for all I know he’s probably a very nice guy
For the physics lab we can't just scan in our work?
I’m sure they won’t care if you scan the sheet
if you didnt scan it
can’t be having that
Holy shit @zackt7718 @nobelium19 @kaori_flute You need to go to sleep
I just saw this and you responded to her so I jumped the gun and didn't look at the timestamps past hers
Sorry Zack
If everyone named Zac(h)(k)(c)(ary) in this school went to war with each other it would be the hunger games
Oh its adam

You arent obliged to stay so if you have any work to do you can pop out
I know, I never feel obligated to stay anywhere

i wish lichess has a switch account thing
That would never work
~~i just lost after 10 moves~~
Lichess doesn't allow you to have multiple accounts
@nobelium19 we forgot to celebrate chinese new year
I want my 红包🧧
Like just working on it
but that isn't due till next week
Still
It’s basically work time
What class
What is the appropriate response when someone asks u to double major?
And he was like “no I’m serious”
idk
It’s so hard to double major with nursing
Covault basically called me an idiot savant in office hours lfg
nursing is one of those majors where you really can't double major, it's just so unique that it's not feasible
oh so they want u to double major with music?
he was like everything you said is correct yet I can tell you aren't really sure WHY it is correct lmfao
lab 0 is due today right
i thought u stopped playing cuz cuckoo started
I've gotten really good math scores but I'm horrible at chess
I can't do that
I was reading the Discrete Math textbook and it mentioned the notation that Java and C use for logic
Nobel and Jenin do ur work smh
Bruh I was doing my work until someone pinged me smh
Chess when you have homework smh
I don't think it's mate in 2
You don't play w your enemies that you destroy
Imagine having 8 queens and still losing the game
I don't know how to play 5d chess
idk neither
Idk lmao
aren't they all?
lol the normal classes are option do u want the whole class to be optional
ok time to study 
byebyeeee
still on 1a smh
To i need to be chinese ?
Oh
it says i didnt use the :
and it wont let me move on
Idk that you want me on a time lol
You need brackets I believe
but it says thats its getting the right result, just that i didnt use the colon operator
will i not lose points for that? idk how this is graded
Nope. I used it a lot
yeah brackets dont help
Well rip what does the solution say
I recommend trying to actually solve it before getting the solution solved for you
it doeesnt do anything when i press that, where is it supposed to show up?
what class
class
oh
i havent had class today
dw i get someone to send us the notes since we missed it
And to leave if you REALLY have to
i guess mine are just more chill

Dude what the fuck I thought I was having a stroke
who want some acrylic paint
I was so lost
nah fr anyone want some acrylic paint
idk
Finding Diamonds is so fucking hard in minecraft
I don't know about medicine, but I think you should go to the school that feels the best for you, whether it is Ivy-League or a less prestigious one
Or I can move to Romania, which is a poorer, less known country than the US, or UK. And study at their medical programs for 6 years. Move to the UK after graduating, and eventually to Australia. I eventually wish to move to the UK, Australia, or Germany. I do not have any intention of moving back to the US for the foreseeable future...
But I am somewhat attached to the US because I've always wanted to do activism work in this country which is sorely lacking in. I've always thought of getting into politics and possibly changing some things/pushing for more legislation to helps workers, and the working class. But I've always had this idea to get into politics in a foreign country first. By gaining citizenship and running for political office there...
don't listen to Zhanda
Isnt that French?
i will kill you
Fin. You need to see a therapist
He looks asian to me, I don't think so
Also before I start I just want to preface this with the fact that 1/2 of what @chandachan says is untrue
@chandachan I think we need to end our friendship with fin from Finland
Bruh what happened
Supposedly for horny people but I dunno why I got it
Man, zhanda said he saw them somewhere on an institutional website or something, so scary
Did u say something like that on vc th other day or im wrong
Accept you won’t regret
It's a dig at ppl who don't wear shoes in them cause ppl shit and have sex in there
It’s a dig at all college dorm showers
I get peeing in showers but why shit lol
I havent tried either of those but I dont need to
Water is a horrible lubricant
beds here b squeaky, probably due to age, i dunno
Moses are you trying to tell us something :eyes2:
Oh I remembered that
looking at the early messages of the server
we really got option 3
Wouldn’t option 4 mean people are getting infected...after they’ve died
hang on I’m trying to math this
simultaneously lots of bad stuff and not lots of bad stuff
How early we looking
Looks like IB math didn’t fail me after all
I’m still rocking on campus regardless
Imagine preparing to become a scientist or engineer for your entire life only to have half of your labs in college done on the Internet
Rip to you guys
Who wants to be stuck at home all day
Remote school in the fall too?
What about vaccines though
Case wants to have everyone vaccinated though
what they want vs whats gonna happen is two diff things
I don't think we'll be remote in the fall
I don’t think so either
Even if everyone is vaccinated, they’re still gna b cautious
anyone want to play chess
I heard one can only do co ops if after one year on campus, not one year just studying
I wouldn't pay a ton if I would have to, id rather have it here and then go
if possible i make sure to do in person labs for engineering so i can actually get a feel for shit
like with my circuits class last fall
Rip for med students going colleges who didn’t prioritize them on campus
I want every lecture to stay remote
Dr. Frost has brought the C-O-L-D upon Houston
holy fuck
It almost never gets this cold here
classes were apparently canceled cuz my dad does research here, and he was told not to go to work that day cuz it was so damn cold
kinda like this shit
@chandachan clement has brought inclement weather across america
Also the citrix platform is sick, ive  been working with pretty demanding programs in there and works great
I tried to use some web apps website run by Case recently and it wanted me to download Citrix software
oh yeah it's a bit weird, lmk if you need help with that!
it's excessive but if his citrix isn't working that could be why
Having 5gb of storage is like enough for backup of academic work tho that u can access with ur id
grabcad requires a local disk tho
Didnt know about it
if you need help howdy will come
For some reason, the web based one wouldn’t work for me towards the end of the last sem
shame for using a macbook 😠
solidworks mostly, but once i got super bored and started running random software it came with
It comes with 117 apps, and i have no idea what the fuck most of these do
right now, solar panel shit
Which class is that?
i want the full package
people at my internship never said "turn it off an back on again"
Oh got it
if everyone's internet dies, blame adam
well thats cuz u fell in
No i didn't
um what's wrong with howdy lol
Pls don't ban me
Oh
i think they were just kinda bored tbh
but like it was on a *really* cold day and they could have enforced violations that are so much worse
I've always wanted to walk on frozen over water, it never gets cold enough to do it in seattle. and they ruined it
adam
let me get this straight
you walked the wade lagoon
fell into the pond
is that what happened? :cursed_flushed:
It was my foot and bad luck
See I didn’t even go that far in lol, I’m fat enough the only reason I would touch the water would be in accident
Shit
Ig i shouldnt go there again
The snow is v powdery RN so its hard
you want sticky snow
~~not me trying to build one right after it snowed~~
Howdy this is the wepa they never fucking work
if its wepa, then ofc it dont work
a) I'm not paying for stupid wepa printing
b) Um they don't work, I once had to go to Tink just to find a working printer
c) 20% of the time they mess up my printing and I have to reprint
but anyway that page is probs due to someone accidentally printing something on ur printer
and the real trick is to print it at work, use up their shit >:)
then u havent learned about the joys of being indoors
I'm sorry, I forgot that when you argue with a discord mod the burden of who wins is set on who is lamest
lame is all we are
well I'm sorry I'm not lame enough for you, howdy
shame, you gotta atleast become 5x lame to graduate
how am I the loopy one here? Don't see it...

https://discord.com/channels/669280377680035842/669363176541782017/728695710781931572
bruh you think I'm gonna graduate? I'm yeeting out of here to plumbing school
how will u lose all ur money and go into dept forever if u dont continue paying case
which is actually bad :thonk:
which sounds like it would be bad
There is a lot of cost to attending college in the form of opportunity costs and tuition though which evens things somewhat
David, this isn't purely financial. This is about doing what you *like* to do as long as you can put food on the table.
~~If I wanted as much money as possible I'd go work at a hedge fund~~
bro i also might want to be an electrician too idk yet
Keeps the world going nowadays
What would we do without electricity
Also the laws are still working on limitations for that n stuff
And not like, emotional pain I guess
deadass though I'd seriously consider switching to a trade mid-career, I was talking to a guy who was a pretty successful product manager at Microsoft but quit to work in drain cleaning
My original plan was to get an associates but lotsa places are demanding at least a bachelors now so rip
Nah man daycare working is the shit
Would’ve been dream career if I could make more money from it
Idk it’s fun
EMAC 270 make my head hurt
At least for me, outside of the hard sciences I’m learning, everything else I’m being taught has already been learned through my lived in experiences
People are being productive without college educations tho?
Makes shit simpler
Nothing happens in a vacuum
We can never get an exact idea of how economies work, but we can use models to approximate them
Yeah a model allows you to start understanding shit, then you can add more shit to develop a more complete understanding
Thats how all sciences work
Reminder that the guy who lost to AlphaGo quit playing Go
@_frostyyyyy_ Can you find a solution to that equation
I don't even know what that is
fuck schrodinger
Y’all lost me here onwards 💀
Sorry Moses
I didnt want to make you feel that way
DiffEqs is gonna be very fun to study
Perhaps my masters thesis for math will be on them, and will involve analysis techniques and geometric principles I learn
Damn are you doing masters in EE or Math?
Math
Come to math club
@chandachan Nah I only need to go to the gym like twice a week
Damn i wish i was time independant
My muscles surely do so I can move around heavy shit
oh
There was one time where a professor was accused of being a terrorist on a plane because he was writing a differential equation
They left
Did someone @ me?
@scottywalker14 sorry your username is very similar to that of David's
YMCA remixes go hard to this chat lmaooooooo
A woman thought he was writing some terrorist thing and then the authorities questioned him and realized it was a misunderstanding, but it delayed his flight
YOOOOOOO WTF
how the actual fuck
Damn thats really less
I've gone a day w/o emails
I also emailed like half a dozen professors in the last week who haven't responded to me 🙃
sorry
fuck you mom I'm going to the sandbox
Moms really are trying to help us
don't pull another all nighter lmao
@chandachan you shall be cursed with a terrible fate for your sins against humanity
You guys need to stop lol, I'm literally getting memed on in the 24 AND the 25 server
damn what a player
ok this was last year when there were 0 cases in hong kong all summer
sorry for handling covid i guess
Didn't you just turn 18?
Isn't that the drinking age in HK
No offense Nobel but I don’t think you will drink even when you turn 21
YESSIR NOBEL ON THE HOMEWORK GRIND
Lol I have never drank any alcohol in any capacity
Although apparently if you don't sleep for 18 hours that's equivalent to 0.05 blood alcohol content
crack a cold one with the boys
Sam drank like half the bottle in one go but there’s still some left
guess imma go to hell
and don't take naps
wouldn't that also be not sleeping for 18 hours
I only pull them when studying for exams if need be

Who the fuck pinged me
No howdy didn’t stop it on purpose
Amazing that he hasn’t been banned yet lol
*amazing that he hasnt been expelled yet
@howdy_. I said this before, you shouldn't have these roles able to be pinged lol
we need to stage a coup
What if ppl have questions tho
That’s fair
what u need
Nothing
Never
Dont be mean to your peers
im a little lost what is happening
Dont ban Zhanda movement
idk why this is even an issue
Bc there’s no way to do it without preventing ppl to ask aimed qs
I guess so
Leave a little I lov u note before he leaves
I don’t know about you but I’m not working
I just have him blocked so I miss all the lovely pings
You can’t claim smol brains
oh lool
Damn
The summer seems so long ago
Oh rip
But managed to rack up some decent hours in volunteer service
Honestly the hours of service were probably more valuable than any grade I got
Need some variety
Wow you really did just dox my political views didn't you?
Fml
Damn
Just really rubs salt over the wound
Rip

Otherwise imma go insane from how boring it is
@kaori_flute i just realized you live one floor above me
And I haven’t even taken an exam yet
215 is driving me nuts from how much I need to memorize and read

I’d be surprised if we go past 45 mins today
too bad I’m busy 😦
this shit
touch screen isn’t working, if that’s a thing
Oh then no clue
I don't recommend it, technically they can bill you for it
No they don't they just don't really advertise it so nobody really knows how to use it lol
rules don't have teeth unless they're enforced
I'm pretty sure it's enforced by software lol, you can't do it
Even if it isn't enforced it isn't a big deal bc nobody uses them lol
Zhanda should you really be pinging after what happened yesterday?
he's pinging for a reason tho
I don't think Fin rushed
@howdy_. @sprinkles2108 @chandachan wtf is zbt
oh
yeah i didn't rush either
i didnt even know that was a thing u could do as a frosh
you didn't know about greek life?
i mean i know its a thing but idk
Finn would much rather fold origami on the weekends than participate in frat rushes 🙂
Cqn i ask what happened
@kaori_flute have you don’t 5c
I was also sleeping. But apparently he pinged the school of engineering multiple times
You know I don't think you guys should leave that in chat
no i'm still on 4a
i stopped working cuz i have a class now
Bruh which class is this?
RIP
~~it's only on sunday~~
it's chill tho
except if u have physics
cuz physics takes too long
i'm considering this a break for my poor non-existent brain
cuz i can't understand anything anymore
I’m tryna do 5 without watching the lecture. I have no idea what I’m doing lmao
i dunno how this spaceship moves through space
~~oh, i have sth for music due tonight~~
You just need to use the X direction tho
even if the plants arent moving
the acceleration doesnt makes sense
u cant just turn 180 magically
Yeah thats fair
It isnt possible irl
and i cant visulize it
@absence000 we should raid the waifuism discord today since it’s Valentine’s
Cause they did all the problems
til there was an si session
REALLY?
I guess
I didn’t delete it
since its consant
Don't die!
Flint lockwood weather machine but for snow
I hate Houston
Hurricanes, inclement weather, abc13
What's wrong with ABC13?
in class
still?????
he did it in one of the lectures tho
Took a break from phys to do Econ. Hate my life rn
for 4 tho, how do model the position, im trying to use desmos, but au just too big
I can explain you if you want
starts slow then speeds up
since in this magical world we can never backtrack
am i anywhere close
to find the time it takes
b4 i do the numbers im trying to picture how the graphs look
is the j graph close?
starts slow then zooms fast
There’s no graph that looks like a j
Wtf is that
looks like one tho
it literally isn't howdy
but we cant go backwards
so gotta b moving up
You never go backwards
You just simply slow down
theres too many letters
I have cracked open a cold one ~~with~~ for the boys
k being a constant that can’t be 0
but i need to figure out how long it takes for a ship to go that
10th grade math placements
What are u trying to do again?
idt you can model it without a piece wise
We went as far as doing calculus on inverse trigonometric functions
oh boi
infinitely slow????
math isnt physics
But physics is math!
fuck physics
damn y'all didn't go on a grocery date with Fin today?
that sucks
moving on
Moving on
shut the fuck up you piece of shit
who wouldn’t be tho 😍
well that means i need to find the starting velocity
@.fim. I will rip all your origami creations and throw them into a bonfire bitch
Except the graph actively avoids (0,0) lodkejdjjdjfdjd
this magical ship buisness is terrible
why would anyone want to turn water into wine
cuz why not
hydrate or dydrate tho
in the olden days drinking alcohol was much safer because water would often be unclean and was difficult to clean, whereas the alcohol in wine and other alcoholic beverages means it wont have bacteria and stuff. also wine has calories ig
especially when you live like 2000 years ago and your life probably sucks
cuz you either hydrate or dydrate
oh shit
ur killing people
if you’re feeling thirsty you _are_ by definition dehydrated
I just applied for Monday and Fri
Cause Wed is hectic
yeah but people arent dying from it...
oh shit i forgot to get tickets
damn it didnt work
maybe they’re trying to piss you off or you’re really hot
oh i think it was this @zackt7718
idk why
Oh my
You don’t know fin from Finland?
:XMARK6: **TheRealDhananjay**, you can't use that.
oh u need to use a ! instead of a ? whats why it didnt work
:XMARK6: **Fim**, you can't use that.
rip 😔
oh ye i do
Jake the dog and Fin the human
holy shit
Not bad
omg
fuck my econ hw is due in 2 hours
thousand years of pain or smt
so, is this the result of magic ship stuff, cuz traveling this many meters in less than like 3 months is wild
i feel like thats a dissapointing endin
Nope
Working now

finn and his god damn cucumbers
adam and his god damn nature valley bars
idk
We don't even have spring break
No we would never do such a thing
Is she still president
Apparently
Seriously who even lives there
Minnesota is actually pretty nice, I might go there eventually since I'm not opposed to cold weather
the color of the Chill role is hard to read
I was waiting for a "you died" screen to pop up there tbh
still working on physics
Awww Ily too ❤️
@_frostyyyyy_ needs his chill tag
TAKE THAT SHIT TO ~~the moon~~ VET SCHOOL
I really don’t do anything on campus most of the time
Doesn't studying take a lot of time?
I meant besides studying
Oh

sorry neel the deed has  been done💔
omg a turn of events
i wish aidan would be my valentine
omg
that’s so much work
damn mad respect wtf
the snickers tho ❤️
the pencil was quirky because i can't use it lol
tho i only use pens..
yeh same tho
sharpies tho
But I don’t wanna kill trees
So it feels more realistic
right right i didn’t realize how nice note taking on the ipad would be
OH and taking math tests on it and then like it’s so easy to upload the pdf to canvas... amazing
Last semester I didn’t have an iPad to do that so I scanned my pages🤡
Yeah sometimes my phone would be slow
Which was annoying
Ah I had Office lens
I wish cwru did that as well lmao
All you need is some duct tape, a hammock strap, and a lawn chair
They gave us all lawn chairs at the beginning of the year but they kinda hurt my ass when I sat in them for a while but I fell off after 30 secs so it’s ok
All four math professors I've had at CWRU so far used their iPads to write everything
I'm still using pen and paper for most things and then scanning with Office Lens for uploading homework like a 🤡
Fair
One of my math professors called out a student repeatedly for laughing constantly through class because it meant he was looking at something else
that’s me though
WHY AM I STILL UP
I HAVE CLASS AT 9:30
But if a professor wants to stop that they should make a “no electronics” rule period
I'm still up because I have two math assignments that I haven't submitted yet and I still have like 7-8 pages to check to ensure I did it correctly 🤡
Cuz now in college homework adds up to your GPA
Damn I’ll have to get used to that
Power went out for a few minutes
16 degrees Fahrenheit, feels like: 0 🥶
Power has been out for several hours and everything outside is covered with snow
Rip
Didn’t think Houston got that cold sheesh
~~except for driving in it tho rip rip~~
as long as it doesnt go into the deep negatives we're chill
O so you get an email if you didn’t test within the last week, way to be proactive lol
that sounds like u didnt go get a test :ban:
oh really
lol yea I’ve been sick since last Wednesday going anywhere is not in my plans
bruh idk why ppl arent like going on their own
i dont really care
If it were closer I would’ve been able to test in the last week
Damn rip lol
u have to pay to get tested if u dont have symptoms
Chicago has a free drive in testing place in damn near every neighborhood
imagine not being able to drive in the snow
I’m v upset I’m not in Chicago right now Bc polar vortex go whoosh
Woah would they really?
There’s so much snow and everything’s freezing in Chicago it’s a literal winter wonderland
wym would they really
which is supposed to get hit worse
so its likely that none of them will be able to get here
Rip
Oh man now I want a snow day
i just want to see my floor
i hope long term they dont cancel snow days cuz zoom exists
Rip to kids these days
snow days where u have to make up missed work anyway in college not so much
How are you working around ur class schedule
Are you working half shifts?
im only prn so i dont have an hour req
I have my eye on this pcna peds job but I can’t even thinking about doing it during the semester
i mean i still have to go thru training and everything
and if school is really heavy i wont be working
If I didn’t have my work study I’d actually just apply
fuck the white fpb scrubs theyre so gross
I want to work over the summer but I also don’t want to think abt housing myself
Ugh I hate planning for the future
but the finaid tho
People who hate on campus housing frat
All we need is some Latin phrase and we’ll b legit
Don't frats also have to get their housing from the university though, or is that optional?
Are we tho
some frats have housing that is separate from university housing, some dont
this also effects when theyre able to live on campus
for example, my friends frat is separate from university housing, so he was able to stay over winter break
bc his frat didnt close
i have 1 day left
did someone gift it to you?
idk it was just a deal
set a reminder, nitro is far more expensive than it needs 2 b

His left foot
Damn all classes remote tmrw
Welp guess not
I have a 6 hour Ochem lab on the quad, that involves a chemical sitting in a distilling flask in my drawer in Millis right now, and I daresay the professor who says "Get the fuck out of my lab" when it's time to go will bow to a little snow
no, if my interview gets cancelled I'll be fucking pissed.
funny how if I tried to smell salt water in high school my chem teacher would spank me
you know about as much as i do with the machines they work with so
idk but i feel like it would be fun ron
i wanted to learn how to do it by hand but that seem like work
It do b work whew
like i came into the thinkbox not knowing jack shit about the 3D scanner arm but i followed the tutorial and came out with my doggy paw print
awwww puppy print
Awww
still needs to be post-processed a bit but i like it
Am trying so hard to stay awake to get updates for my classes tomorrow
But sleep cycle says no we sleep
I’m trying to figure out whether it’ll be asynchronous or not
yeah the tutorials are a bit hard to find but once you do they are gems
@addat I ended up pulling up to rascal house, their cookies taste like cardboard
Yeah, i bet they cost like $30 too for one cookie and terrible service. 10/10 overrated.
Sad to see it

Awesome, thxs. I just wasn’t sure cuz their email was saying that staff go remote for tomorrow and that the Covid testing site would be closed tomorrow
Not trynna go to Veale from north side at 7:30am just for it to be closed😅
Weather.com says that it feels like 3 degrees Fahrenheit here 🥶
I woke up at 4 AM because I went to sleep at 8 PM because there's nothing else to do in the dark when it's freezing
Fortunately, I was still able to get some work done yesterday before sunset, such as getting ahead of schedule on reading the Discrete Math book
They were Closed😑

You know you need to get a phone when you can count the seconds between each percentage drop
my first package, which had all my clothes in it, came more than a week late 🙃
They're boring don't learn anything about them
The live in the sand for 7 years, suck fish blood, then breed, then die
arent those the gross things
people still have numbers in their names
you need to look inside yourself to find the answer there
people outside my room were sniffing chemicals
Sam don't snitch on me

my soc class is at 9:30 am Monday/Wednesday, but I have no complaints
I had an 8 am sages last semester

9:30 is not bad for me at all
i was never cut out for waking up early
some periods of my life i wake up super early

so... die?
Doesn’t seem financially sound
we need more snow
I feel horribly sleepy if I wake up before 7 AM even if I got 8+ hours of sleep
need u to drop the link again cause im not actually in the club

anyways someone should still drop a link
Somehow I’m on their mailing list even though I don’t plan to attend the meetings
in class rn tho
Class
@raunakwastaken I can invite you to come games if you want

Finn is apparently a chess goddess
Is the meeting still going on?
I just left
But they are still playing matches
It's the first time its been allowed since spring of last year
Looking at the dashboard last week was by far the most tests administered and the lowest positivity rate
I gotta get tested tomorrow\ I almost forgot about that lol

who wants to return to monke
please leave. "UwU" is a personal attack to society
i never understood the concept of uwu. can someone explain it to me
oh
im sorry but please keep your kinks at a social distance
I think uwu is supposed to b like a nodding/satisfied face
i don't really see it but ok
pain
Things disseminate so quickly through social media that a lot of it gets cut off from its original source anyway
How many megs do you need??
but i know that majority of active people here are mech-E comp-sci students trying to flex memes
rip all the premeds lmao
How can I get crack head role?
pre-meds dont exist
At least going based off roles, eng isn’t even the majority here lol
:XMARK6: **Anhelly (Clarke 304E)**, you can't use that.

But it didn’t change their color
i hate my shade of blue lmao
Cause mine would be weird red cause of horny jail. But 2024 is higher so it’s blue

We hate 2025
So you didn’t leave your mom by choice
Oh

i was with like 5 ppl in a car
Nothing looks good

All you need is a match to do it urself :p

@moseslee what tells me u aint a closeted cunt

That’s so weird I thought u were saying closed and then for a second I thought we never left the c-section convo
China doesn’t care about that
Yeah for something to be truly Orwellian is very very hard
Nah we def left that convo
essays are bad enough, i dont want to even imagine what extended essays are
Not exactly why I dropped out of ib but yet another reason why I hate it

_The Last Man in Europe_
Boring
cuz he got horny
Speaking of dungeons what happened to my young youthful new college kid dreams of doing dnd :SniffSneezeTears:
they're poor but have enough to be content
covid happened
there was dnd last semester
No porn and no drugs would make Ron a sad kid 😢
But he had the wits to see what was wrong with it
Or I should say: what _could_ go wrong
Stalin was in his very last years of power
The thing about any proposed system is that in the hands of humans it can and will go wrong
I'm still on my VPN
It prompted his successor Khrushchev to denounce him right after his death
shame
it wasnt tendies
I have never tried these famed tendies
jolly fries arent bad, but they arent the best
we're not friends anymore
Onions are good rip
Wrong.
Fair
Wrong.
Raw onions can fuck off
raw onions suck
Damn raw onions are the shit
Wrong.
the smell of onions cooking tho
You guys really need to try having the right opinion
Nah we don’t fw cheese
and thats where ur wrong ron
theyre still shit tho
I thought about it while typing my paper and then thought about it so hard I had to make it my status
That could honestly work too in a sense
Cant even tell if that’s an emoji worm or emoji wormhole
its xok isnt it

you didnt know they were talking about wormholes now did u
i need to sleep
ugh
sleep is for the week

I wish #quotes weren’t mostly pictures, I wonder who contributes the most to it
I’m convinced that everything at case is horrible
video is so bad lmfao
Clicking any link ever seems like a bad idea
just know what the link is, then u never have to click it
that aussieland has not nearly enough things wanting to kill u to b real
possible, but they have nothing on the power of grease that is used here
you dont say
oh rip
Fuck

What the fuck is this
What the fuck is a calc bc?
I dont claim it

i dont judge
As for the other major I need to, you know, get a _proper_ job
I’m still finding a suitable bio related primary major
maybe zbt doesnt reconize zbt
I dont know really. Comp sci was my initial choice
I do miss music somewhat. I was a bassist for 9 years
dw, we'll only shame you immensely for being in zbt
no way i’m staying far away from zbt
No place needs so many majors
all we need is buisness
Money major
idk what that means but it doesnt look like my IG
the underscore italicises sorry
thonk me as you wish
ngl i idk wtf happened
I think Jun is feeling lonely
And wanted u
well you cant spell biden without bid

i had to leave vc again
crying about chess
well it might be @howdy_. but idk
@raunakwastaken I need your help
i dont know what to say

Cwime is bad 😢
I would be sad, but I dont speak fursona
sigh
their furs get stuck in your mouth
I had to or else it would seem like I unironically have sex with furries
Jun when someone posts a furry heart
go to sleep
dont pretend that is me
Liking chess is worse I think
I am not toxic tho
nah it's not bad
is chess really free tho
Gotta buy the board tho
but i can tho
Howdy if you mute me, this server will be boring again
Lol it wasn’t boring before u
Def not you tho?
this server is never boring
seems cannibalistic to me
Harvard medical school calling ☎️

As long as the furries leave me alone
you wont accept urself jun?
This is the most homesick I’ve ever felt and it’s only because I could just go to the kitchen put some nugs and fries in the air fryer and watch tv at 1am smh
What’s wrong with jun uwu
im in pain
hey pain
Sleep is the best cure for pain they say
he's not pain zack

Hi in pain I’m communist blood

Weeb isn’t ethnically exclusive lol
Didn't your roommate lowkey not like that you were taiwanese

Studying a language for a long time seems like work
@chandachan knows someone who has a good cleaning tool @jundragon99
I don't have to use your key
I can now fix the wepas when I want
"fix"
its impossible to "fix" them
why do you need to print?
Don’t say that
And we don’t get that money back anyway

u dont have a unique role do u
could b wrong
damn i shoulda asked for chill role 😔
#quotes exists becuz i wanted it to b
it seems like this server was a different place back in the early days
As all servers are until there’s enough people that there’s a need to actually organize
I miss that vibe
Wasn’t really summer it was fake summer
I don’t care
I was crying physical tears
Neel didn't you go to a top private school in Ohio ?
How did this come to happen
Evolution is completely voluntary omg

I love my cold brewed teas
If I put on a turban people would think that I have voldemort on the back of my head

OHHHH I DIDNT SEE THIS TEXT
all these zoom lectures are so god damn boring
I don't get why we only have 12 minute long videos for chem

I would rather just watch an hour of organic chemistry tutor

Howdy won’t give it to you
didnt you guys commit to case?
then you dont need perspective, you need the 2025 role
early decision
one sounds bad
i can't defer if i'm not committed
howdy it is only fair that you extend this color privilege to me
because there isn't a 2025 role methinks
no it isnt
thats cuz u spys arent allowed on campus :P
jen's name isn't even pink
you want howdy to go through the trouble of finding the hash values of the pink in your pfp just for you?
pink or pain
there's this one server im in where you can choose the colors yourselves
oh time for class
I'm at the end of week 3 and I still only have graded work in one class 🤡

chem with no math is the best chem
chem WITH math is sm easier
screw this math nonsense
i can't even do number one on the quiz
studying without studying is the best imo O.O
rip abed

he'll need nitro for that :smug:
I don't have nitro
:XMARK6: **Anhelly (Clarke 304E)**, you can't use that.
You will NEVER know the difference
jenin go study
ye9 has the power to make emotes? not fair
ugh. also i did not see you
I still waiting for my calculator 😞
Oh I forgot
guess it's not there yet
really?
i need to get food
finn you about to die bro

What happened on campus?
Actually if we walked out together, we won't die
i need someone other than zhandy to tell me leutners closes at 8
DUDE IT'S CLOSED AT 8
What happened?
You guys can’t go out right now
They didn't specify the emergency
i dont
idk what else it would be tho
Well it's very serious because I got called this time and I've never been called before
Finn if you don’t know don’t make predictons just chill
I got a phone call for an emergency
idk what else it could be
Oh same
I have never gotten a phone call for an emergency on campus before 👀
What happened though
Oh
oh shit they sent an email
OMG BRO ARE YOU TRYING TO DIE OR EAT FOOD
OMG
does it close at 8 or not
Someone was robbed
Holy fuck what happened?
Someone was robbed
What happened????
holy shit
I was out like 10 mins back
Damn
I didnt get dinner as yet😭
Lesson learned: don't live on South side
Bruh I don't want to live on south side
South side is sketch as fuck
It's because they know us freshmen are dirt poor
isn't den regular swipes? why would anyone go to leutner
apparently the due date for these to be used was 2 days ago
I knew this was really serious when I got a phone call about it
:XMARK6: **Anhelly (Clarke 304E)**, you can't use that.
I'm near Downtown, not in the suburbs
doxxing seems so bizarre considering people can just look up most people's addresses
and no you can't
sorry Nobelium #6468
I have never seen any violence so the thought of violence on campus sends a chill down my spine
Houston is really violent
that class got so repetitive after october
Did the dog attacc
okay i thought he might've died
Also no pinging me. Bad children
Aren't you nob
@everyone take a field trip to wyant gym. You need to go outside
kinda hungry
Somebody's coat went missing in facilities
although cwru isnt rly larger than average
wtf are those categories tho
In November 2020 someone stole a graphics card from a computer
if it wasnt someones personal machine
they didnt make out with that much
That already happened once
No 4 teenagers with guns went through wade and took everyone's phones and computers and wallets etc
Then my freshman year a dude like tackled these guys trying to steal his car so he got shot
Damn
> UCPD in foot pursuit
they ran they guys down, they didnt even use the smart car lol
Basically how it panned out is that the student body said there weren't enough security alerts, and they want to know immediately. So then in my Sophomore year, lots more security alerts happened, as requested, and people complained and didn't follow shelter in place
people didnt follow it this time
yeah and that could potentially have been really bad
my Freshman year somebody fired shots by the botanical garden and then ran down juniper road towards the dorms but the police like herded him away and over back down wade park ave
You don't know where it is on campus
*they should say where it is tho*
Nah it’s probs better if they didn’t
well adam and I took a peek and didnt see anything
so we assumed it wasnt near us
oh
Wasn’t this like the first one
Cuz the other one wasn’t a shelter thing just an “avoid this area” thing
didn't fuck around when i said i was a boomer eh?
I mean when I say I’m a boomer I mean close to actual literal physical death
Oh yeah in august of 2019 somebody left a gas valve open in a lab in Kent Hale Smith and it went kaboom
What the hell, how are there so many safety incidents here?
It’s a college campus?
sitting in his throne @ tyler house waiting for an IR to happen
Just cuz
I mean it happened to Virgina Tech too
VT's shootout was the worst one
That guy didn't fit the profile of most school shooters. He was a 63 year old Indian guy
Damn
VT's was fucking horrifying
school shootings are bad
Wtf the dude studied in CWRU
I solved school shootings
Damn
Actually tho after VT Case put a lot of security features so that the same thing can't happen here
i want my lawyers
VT was so bad because the building that the guy was shooting in was like unescapeable
Someone will source u in their manifesto
VT's was scary as hell
oh we r talking about school shootings
sorry
Oh shit yea it do b
I know several people who got robbed but I have never seen any violence with my own eyes
sure it aint code@addat
Missing
Adult go bye
Baby missing
Damn what did the baby do
Bad materials
there isnt one
I'm no where near Sugar Land, I live like 5 minutes from Downtown
code gray is severe weather
Lmao wtf
Some use violet tho
Damn
I fw the hospital who just say shit
Then the cleveland robbers probably won't get you
How is David still not chill
He won't experience any crime
Tax fraud is the hospital
The whole hospital commits it together ❤️
I mean highschool we didn’t even do those things
Oh
Ukno there’s gotta b someone out there who animates real life bad crimes for fun do not thonk me
Like nothing I’ve ever seen
Except with every other tragedy
Didn’t have anything yet they were just talking out their ass lol
Well stonks is nothing I mean real tragedies
they cant handle the 💎 ✊
I hate seeing ads for all the subreddits
Don’t b paper hands 😤😤
Dont b weaksauce paper hands
It means that you sell when you have a loss because you'r afraid that your position will get worse instead of holding on and hoping it improves
I have earned more money by working than from stocks
Honestly sock works here I’m leaving it
Everything people get into is like “there’s a 0.001% chance I’ll do this and make enough money to never work again but damn if I don’t spend 1000s of dollars how will I get that chance?”
I don’t have enough oxygen in me to combust 😢
i wont shame
shame?
im so sleepy but lowkey i should study
ugh
I did a 50pt test in 12 minutes ~_~
So apparently I'm one of 14 million people in America right now who is being ordered to boil their water first before drinking it 🤡
sounds bad
@_frostyyyyy_ if you want to stay at my family's home tell me
however many you want
u aint slick
bruh u like 90 minutes late
yeah sorry for the 2 am ping cam
ye9 seems surprised every time she is pinged like its never happened before
~~ok can't saty awake for any longer gn~~
does crossing it out mean u dont actually mean it or
jun is never a joke
i dont mean that jun himself is a joke
I need someone from whom I can model my sleeping  schedule after
oh i misread this
oh

too tired to convince
yeah he went to my school
You need to avoid me at all costs then
Such bad sleeping schedule
Bird flu?
Sigh time to go to work in one hour :(
Russia saw China and raised them one bird flu
you already got my package teehee
sigh
rip x
i have been lied to. i am alone in wade
development is _hard_
I hope it’s playable tho
i haven't considered the playability
i don't play the flute
Make it hard, Zhander
Ideally
Don’t have the flute go higher than a6 or lower than c4
For people with limited skills
I like to work my musicians
dont awh me, i am no pet
the piano part is already fuckin bad
Piano players, they hate me
@addat what does it feel like to be king
Oh rip
oh i was tryna dig up the valentines spartie gif
damn
you are wrong!
Apparently Howdy spoke on a zoom call recently
i am not afraid, the strikethrough didnt work
he actually looks very normal except for how he wears a vest in 90 degree weather and is balding
after we survive math UwU
I don't know Japanese but the Chinese character for "to die" is in there so
死 = die
why aren't we speaking american!
Why do ur gifs not work Zack
because trying to spell it causes depression
Oh
if you want to say no
不是 means "isn't"
Do Chinese and Taiwanese people hate each other or is that just a government thing
we have a very bad superiority complex
Depression is a serious illness, millions of people die every year!
I mean wasn't china basically colonized in the 1800's from the spheres of influences by european powers?
so i guess?
that's fair
it does not need as much typing
then they fled and become poor. thank you commoners -_-
thats why not everyone hates him in china
i learn not to hate
well you can't really resent someone when you are dead
God I wish
i am working so no microphone
i have nothing against reese witherspoon but all these gifs are horrible
i feel like jared 19
omg
but something tell me it wrong
what u need
no no, tchaik 6 last mvt
i leave at 3
dont bother me so many package
raunak don't
even i don't watch anime
Never ♥️
It was literally 12 hours back. You don’t remember?
too tired smh
wade closed sorry
emergency had to close Wade
because physics is terrible
that is sad
if u come to wade, maybe i let you cry on my shoulder
tchaik about to die
hewp him
Shower Poop I cant help you
we need howdy to intervene
@kaori_flute you didn’t invite me to your marriage
raunak wants to be in an open relationship
I didn’t unfortunately
too young for that, except halcyon
I dont remember signing a contract for marrying
i-
uh
have a good excuse for failing my math exam
chris will know
he doesnt love me
Jenin, jun wants to spank you
pls kill @moseslee
damn
didn't work
i dont think i like the sound of that
it is me alone
oh
jenin are you sure you will be able to handle jun's humongous package?
It’s hard not to
it is hard
@jundragon99 can i park my car in your garage?
Jun you can park your car in my garage any day of the week
we dont have garages
oh. nw you can park your car in mine
Theta Chi, you see it when you leave leutner
U don’t have one? How
if u dont have a garage
by leaving
bad i will tell Howdy
How much money u make from that
I don’t 😔
They haven’t arrived
i need my fix
I was sad when it was empty
oh no
(don't get the mcrib)
oh no
i never seen it
yeah and boiled eggs suck
they taste so bad
omelets tho
Yeah obviously you can break them but they’re actually really strong if you distribute the weight. So if you hold one in your hand and squeeze it it’s actually really hard to break. But it’s easy to break against a bowl or whatever cause the force is concentrated. You can try it if you want I know it sounds like a prank but it’s not u can look it up
i find runny yolks similar to the texture of snot
bad egg
i don't car e about you opinion moses
i let the beaten eggs curdle before killing the heat and stirring in the cheese
they're fully cooked tho
i will go back to working now
will miss u jun
If anyone needs groceries I am getting some tomorrow
i just watched the twitch hypetrain record get broken
depression still?
i will be out of wade soon without incident. feel free to come after that
jun wants to meet jenin
Why can't white people make Asian babies
Two whites don't make a wong
Never
My sims save is gone :pepecry:
what happened 2 it?
I don’t knowwwew
google sims lost save or something
Ye I’m looking thru the files
And nothing wtfff
Okay uve lost me
uh oh
its weird tho
So they probably don’t use it
Hate to see it
damn
click on view in the top left
sims hates onedrive and it breaks saves
I hope the verify game files didnt overwrite the save
it is checked rip
besides that, I dunno
Wonder why it goes to onedrive tho
where ever u want, just copy the save files and paste them somewhere else. I dunno if sims has an ingame way to back it up, but that way should work manually
Ok also, for worst time it'd be O(N), with N representing the size of the array, right?
if anyone wants tendies from the den say I
what sauce do u think Zach might want
den doesn't have hosin will bbq do
@walemelaiye zach didnt order anything
@toomanyzs me sorry
You can change it if you want
duo is an annoying necessity
Damn
anyone want to play mad verse? we only have 4
what is mad verse
howl is written in mad verse
Lmao how does that work

dude fr no one walks that slow in real life
and u wouldnt get off ye dang phone
Fim you can't just roast my man zhanda like that
oh my

@toomanyzs fr doe what happened
i hate that so much
fr tho what were u doing
ur actually lame in real life ngl
No I was taking my sweet time because it was cold
sorry but if you are taking up the entire crosswalk i will shove you into traffic
@jaff_er u clearly dont understand how incredibly slowly zhanda walks

Hi so hungry, how are you?

No we were going to thwing and i was walking at a *normal* pace while Finn is literally makinh it look like a Damn 800m race
zhanda so lame irl

i shouldnt need to spend money 😡
Just put it in someone else's bridge :cliffordsmile:
den food goes bad after like 20 minutes
@howdy_. i mean theres lots of snacks that i can buy that dont need fridge
well then why arent you eating them rn
cause i ate them
i ate like a very unhelahty amount of snacks because i didnt realize the den was open late
so i ate like one meal a day of snacks
and then i ran out
never run out when costco about
i honestly still havent fully figured out the meal plan at case
order food when hungry
idk where most people eat most of the time
I'm so hungry
I don't swipe
yea, if the staff isnt there, you have no need to swipe
part of the issue is i dont eat most food
it do b normal swipes tho
hard enough to find food rn
how about tomorrow finn, since u dont have class
i havent rly looked that hard tho
i didnt know sutff was covered
most vegan food kinda yuck tho ngl
u usually dont give people your credit card :thonk:
thats more than enough if you dont just eat chipotle everyday
use it when you dont see anything u want on campus
if i use case cash even 3 times a week its gone in like 4 weeks
you dont expect to eat out everyday do you?
but it doesnt change like my fundamental meal situation
but it seems like most people dont actually have leutner that much
if you are out there for class
i dont like sandwhiches
doesnt the den have like a quinoa burger or smth
and their tofu is kinda lame too
i dont cook at all right now because im at college and im on a meal plan
oh
Yeah I figured that a picky eater would want absolute control over what they eat
BUT U CANT GET OUT OF MEAL PLAN
really.?
i feel like normally i look and its just the same 4 places
i never wake up before 12 so idk
Don’t u have morning classes?
earliest is 1130, i thought i would be on west coast this sem so i made them all late
Aww
i just need to fix my sched
is not how youre supposed to live
i'd take it over waking up early
why dont you go up to daves and get some?
i dont want to wake up "early", but i deally id go to sleep at 12 and wake up at 9
idk what daves is
I’ve been waking up really late lately
smh my head
ill probably go to the drugstore again tho at some point
also if 9am aint early for u
i mean i went to high school for 4 years???
still early
yeah it isn’t
normall people shouldnt be awake at 2:36 am except on special occasions you realize????
far too early
well, we aint normal
we're a special kind of stupid
I have been awake at 2:36 am for over 6 months
i just want to live normally again
well this is my normal, so I guess i'll wave you buh bye :p
idk i guess it depends on the person
im rly not that productive super late
unnatural idk
im never productive
I’m gonna get hate for this
Procrastination is efficient due to fear of failing
wah i almost forgot i had a shift at wade
if for some reason you need me @zackt7718  for a package, i am in back. please feel free to yell and embarrass yourself
if you are in need of attention, just yell my anme
@howdy_. some emotes are gone :0
i dont see u
zhanda is short
Note to self to never buy groceries on Sunday
google translate is laughably bad :xcrittyx:
@chandachan dont be a stranger. i want to sled
Oh lala
I joined 10 mins back
Already left
I joined the session in the last 10 mins and could only check 4&5. They’re correct
I have some of 4 and 5 left
I’m not in my room yet
they lost so bad that it went on national news when they finally won 😦
for me to even get married i need a fiance
Pain. Though that’s actually not new🥲
wait u didnt actually answer him tho...
Doesn’t matter
Shout out to @howdy_. tagline that hasn't ever changed since I've seen it
@.fim. do you want to come
Me ! Chem is gonna kill me ! :D
@.fim. I'm sorry I will be more mature next time 😔
wtf a homo lumo man
Aw ❤️
Ugh
Oh
i take notes and still dont understand
Is it still freezing in texas
I never called anyone out
I’m so unmotivated to study
unfortunately facebuilder's trial ran out but I can still do other stuff
isn't that literally what that is
When Warren Harding used the "return to normalcy" campaign, he won in the biggest landslide in American history
anyone want 3d animated emotes for here
I know I would fail if I tried majoring in physics 🤡
I’d die
He got waitlisted at every med school he applied to though
prolly just overworked so had bad grades lol
cause yknow
But I don’t really count chem
double major: math and math
Oh yeah it looks like that but i didn’t mean it in that way
My wording was just bad
I don't understand how people manage to pull off being an engineering pre-med
hard drugs
One guy that I work with on linear algebra homework has a 4.0 GPA in biomedical engineering and a 100th percentile MCAT
100th percentile isnt even a thing :thonk: that is impressive
MEANWHILE IM SCARED FOR MY FIRST BIOL 215 EXAM🤡🤡🤡🤡
You can get a not-perfect score and still get a 100th percentile
idk why
Man if only I was David’s homework buddy
I wish I was a genius like that
they're just build different i guess
bruh i didnt even know harvard had a med school
I didn’t know til 10th grade lol
The other guy I work with homework on for linear algebra is a math/EE double major so I'm surrounded by geniuses
Idk man
i bet u can do it without summer classes
Ap credits can only cover like 5 classes max tho
Eh it wouldn’t help THAT much though
Even with AP credits there's a ton of classes associated with just a single engineering major, let alone two
I don’t know
no, double at most, im just wondering
prolly math+econ but idk
So I feel validated
Andrew Ng, the founder of Coursera, did a triple major in economics, computer science, and statistics
Go for it if you want to
nah prolly just gonna do math econ
math prolly better than stats
Tbh math goes better with econ than CS does
Math classes like real analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, topology, etc. are desired by grad committees in economics
not sure if ill get a masters in math or econ tho lol
He’s correct though
I also respect math majors a lot since some of the upper-level math classes are really tough
*they can always double major with a stem major tho*
Your sleep schedule says otherwise
Ah shit
I wish man. I wish
I can't sleep when I want on most weeknights because I work on homework due the next morning until late 🤡
Oh for me I have to study
Which I don’t do effectively by the way
BIO EXAM IN A WEEK IMMA CRY
For example, I still haven't submitted linear algebra homework due tomorrow morning, and I have two homework assignments due on Tuesday
And do the practice exam for chem tomorrow
All of this studying is worth it though for the reward after 4 years of this
my back hurts
scary
the thing doesn't know how to handle transparency
and we also need to rename the server to CWRiss Me I'm Irish
OH
I don't kiss even without rona
yeah idk why it's like that
isnt that 4 march tho
also doublethonk is too big for discord, rip
isn't that an easy fix, reducing quality?
oh well i’m sorry one day you’ll get there
Howdy is already included I thought
gonna need a payment of atleast 10 nature valley bars a day
I should get off discord rip
Not a physics person sorry
Priyanka if you don't read the notes your GPA will drop from a 4.4 to a 4.1
AHHHHHHHHHHH CANT LET THAT HAPPEN OMG NO GOD PLEASE NO
School is golf
or is golf school?
mysteries science still cant answer
don’t tell michael gabe
ever since I took bio225 I'm an evolution expert ✨
well i could've told you I was a mistake without taking a bio course
zhanda dont even doing the quote right
smh my head
Finn something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
isn’t it the other way around “we’re different from each other because we’re all mistakes”
Nah I don’t think so
Are u implying that genetic mutation was never meant to happen hence “mistake”
Here is my game. It is so rough because it was just 2/3 people working on it frantically (me and another)
It’s raining :0
hit him up after the class
OMG
~~i have a calc exam tomorrow tho~~
well you don't want to fail lmao
you can study during the lecture lol
i kinda lost interest in that class too
@ansh8867 are you going to the next math club meeting
What did I type tho that was bad
I didn't offend anyone
Coz you said I was getting fiesty so just wanted to know. Dm me
Happened to me too
@jaff_er what happened
you passed
the scuba certification went through
you passed the air mixed gas commercial diver program
jaffer would you like to work at wade?
i didnt realize till afterwards tho
I left it lol
Nope 😔😔
rip
to the worst
@kaori_flute how is math going?
imagine knowing math
I'm taking three math classes this semester
raunak
just convince yourself that u know math
i think i also have to take 3 math classes next sem
trick your brain that you know math so it actually knows math?
~~i think i don't know how many math classes i'm taking next semester~~ prolly similar to u raunak
It's really doable, honestly discrete might be the easiest class I've ever taken
it depends on your brain if it actually ends up knowing math
i'm not quite sure about mine tho
time to study :LAUGHING:
yeyy i passed thru wade today
I could be saving 5 seconds of my life from trying to strike the uwu
its up to god now. i will pass if they want me to 🤡
Oh, it looks like Chris Butler switched to letting people submit their work for partial credit this semester, after it was multiple choice last semester
The multiple choice exams last semester almost killed my GPA
If you're talking about chem113 I'm sorry ;-;
I don’t know if I learned hyperbolic trig in BC
Test 1 was the easiest in MATH 122 imo
this convo is telling me to study
Math is my fav part of chem.. does that jog your memory a little? LMAOOOO
Did your bae of bengal leave you
rip spellin
oh
omg
idk hoe to spell
idk what mimalist is okay
went from raunak
computer scientists are minimalists
i never said i'm a computer scientist though :closethonk:
That's a fake room though right?
Nope it’s real I think
I don’t know
ok
i can't hold on any longer, good night
I really should be studying
i'll fail
we'll fail
You're not going to fail
NO YOU WONT
Watch lectures and do your homework and you won't fail anything
Sorry Howdy
:XMARK6: **Fim**, you can't use that.

@ansh8867 Do you want me as your roommate
Will see man. Are you not with Dhanajay tho?
At least that's what I know from Math Club
@djsurti why didn’t you tell me that zhanda was supposed to be your roommate
No Dhananjay isn't my roommate 💀
Oh
@jundragon99 its gone
its fucking gone
I haven’t been to India in so long

Moses with the hard s
U died almost?
My name is Finn Owsley. I'm 19 years old. My house is in the northeast corner of Lake Washington, where the nice parks are, and I am not married. I worked as an employee for Domino's pizza, and I get home every day by 9 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 2 AM, and make sure I get nine hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of cold water and doing about 40 minutes of walking before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
> I am not married
@.fim. want to change that?
Raunak accept it. Finn doesnt want you anymore

My name is Ansh Bhatia. I'm a US Citizen from Bangalore, India. I may brag occasionally sometimes but I'm really content with myself. I can get crazy sometimes jamming to Hindi songs on Alexa. I'm BME/Bio on pre-med track. Please don't consider me as a genius. I love going to TVUC and the library with friends but they're busy procrastinating/studying or avoiding me. I have learnt some skills of street-smartness. I failed the IB with a 40 and don't ask about first sem GPA. I'm in the Math Club and CCEL launchpad with Priyanka in it. Hopefully , I make some great friends and leave a mark.
its morning pls dont call me rn

No you don't, although you sound kinda sarcastic sometimes
Bruh I can't even recognize my voice
You sound like you're fried harder than an elephant ear at the texas state fair
If you told me it was my voice I wouldn't know
god I wish
Zach watch me sleep I cry
A little myringotomy never hurt anyone

Don't believe the liessss
exterminating the Uyghurs at 3AM gone sexual (talked to Kobe????)
cant tell if meme or no
Underachievers deserve nothing
they just need edumacation!
its not really china causing an issue
moses gonna lose his credit score
Holding one million religious and ethnic minorities under government detention centers 

nothing to see here, please disperse
must be the air
As much as I don't trust the media I'll sure as hell trust them over Chinese newspapers who will be killed if they aren't favorable to China lmfao
i don't
not really with nationalist imperatives
auth left intesifies
tbh China isn't respecting Hong Kong's 50 year autonomy
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html

nothing to see here
im not actually defending china, but theres a ton of propaganda about this and theres like no actual sources. to be perfectly clear i hate the chinse government as much as anyone else
Finn I was wrong about you
Why u need many knives
Children saw their parents taken away, students wondered who would pay their tuition and crops could not be planted or harvested for lack of manpower, the reports noted. Yet officials were directed to tell people who complained to be grateful for the Communist Party’s help and stay quiet.

nothing to see here
fuck mike pompeo regardless of whats going on in china
moses, are they allowed 2 go to school or are there limits on that
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55794071

nothing to see here they are just being "re-educated"
really ?
i agree that _something bad_ is happening at the very least
🇺🇸 Gov can't even help themselves
probably, bad news sells

but to act like nothing bad is happening is asinine
🇨🇳 did nothing wrong
i do sometimes wonder if im one of the german folk who lived near death camps and never once questioned what was going on across the barbed wire
I didnt pay attencion in english
those documents dont say anything about a million people
So edgy. Don't hurt urself with that edge
Because I have a test in a couple weeks about them
apparently its one knife per household
basically the more conservative members of my family agree that china is terrible _but_ "she'll only come for your head if you provoke her first"
say goodbye to ur social credit score
I'm Italian and we will do nothing because they elected Mussolini's relative to office
but patriotism isn't a crime so
Shush go sleep
I can’t be shushed I will just use telepathy
@zackt7718 just to be clear im really not trying to argue that nothing is happening, my point is just that its exaggerated and theres tons of propaganda and lots of people have motivation to be very misleading
yeah i hate that just as much
i mean while i guess this is the side of china the media will never ever dare to portray; you can't always bring this up when people talk of "genocide"
which is really rich
they once tried to be assimilated into the soviet union
Riding the magic school bus all the wayyyy
ouch
China will never do that
We want to. But they keep invading us. No touchy
landlocked countries have less value unfortunately
China wants to unify
we would go bat shit insane if china moved an inch
there is no telling how bad a move it would be if china touched taiwan
oh lmfao I mis interpreted the fuck outta this
partially because they need a presence in the south china sea
Taiwan wants to be free
Rainy
you can't be a leader without being a hypocrite
if i was in biden's position i would be such a fucking hypocrite
Lmao i forgot😂 😂
I want to claim sovereign over cwru
Storm wade all you want tomorrow. I don't work 😆

John Kerry has a station in Antarctica he uses to shot laser beams into the sky to cause global warming
Ugh
i think this one is modenrized tho
and when she gave birth to my mom her hospital photo was captioned "forever loyal to chairman mao"
This makes me feel :so_hot: :shareit:
"what happens when you push a baby under water?"

It fucking dies
the video isnt actually prageru its a ytp
its cuz stonks can only go up
prageru is trash tho
their vid on the death penalty was just
bad
their whole argument was "wouldn't _you_ want the convict to die? if u dont then somethings wrong with u"
you didn't even try to scratch the surface
and when the union didn't hire actual speds to lead the Potomac army
idk shit about military strategy but he was defending slavery so
im saying people dont make money there
i would call it a think tank except that it does more disseminating than thinking
IIRC he fought for the south because he was from there and actually didn't like slavery. But..... by proxy he fought for slavery because that is what the south was fighting for
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.
He’s commenting on how it was probably not the founding fathers’ intention to just let us go amok with self defence
idrc what the founding fathers wanted tho tbh
Let’s study physics after math >:)
how was ur exam
Jenine I'll prolly take a mental health break for a few hours after the test today
cuz my brain do be fried
Sam told me you made him an awesome poster which he stuck outside his door
Oh I am honored
I found this picture and I’m going to cry it’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
isnt that rilakkuma
time to fail the exam in 30 minutes
Retaking Calc 2 was the move last semester I’m too dumb for 223
David since you’re the math god pls wish us luck
We need it
idk man i never screenshotted
i didn't even know if i wanted to do bio back then
Someone tell me why I’m now finding Drew’s practice problems for this exam
I got a 97 in Calc 3 which was much easier imo and I should be able to pull off the same thing in Discrete Math
Aight time to yeet. Big brains have taken over
Hold up I’m still here
funnily enough im not too worried about math though i _feel_ like i should be
i feel like i should be terrified
Even tho I'm not an engineer
Oh yeah, I remember that. Math club
aren’t you bme though
BME or biology. Haven't declared yet but you caught me there
Because I stupid
You haven’t seen me in school man🤡
What happened
Nothing to see
Damn
@kaori_flute what are you doing on discord. Our test is in 10mins
Math is very very easy
numbers can't hurt you
Math is just numbers it can’t be bad!
Gl. Math is easy
I dont
tip: it's "maths" and not "math"
I meant 126 is the lame calc 2
math _s_
mathS
At least I could focus on chem and bio last semester😋
math *viper noise*
You took BC and call yourself stupid 🤔
math *sssssssssssssssssss*
Damn
I did horrible on my tests last year because of college applications and Calc is hell at my hs
My IQ isn’t even 130 LOLLLLLLLLL
@djsurti you haven’t experienced Calc at my hs. It’s awful
I would’ve died at an Ivy League. I’m barely scraping by at cwru🤡
Same reason why many other people are here: I didn't get accepted
I heard Cornell is very hard though
There's always the chance to go to the Ivy League for graduate school though
I don’t even know why I applied
i dont care though, didnt want to go to harvard. i just apply for joke
I really wanted to go to Columbia or Brown
I wanted to go to Murica
Our school only allows 13 applications
I’m still hurt over that
I didn’t even apply
not to the point where I resent case but I’m _hurt_
Undergrad college admissions is screwed
college counsellor hate you kids
I’m not hurt by my rejections anymore
I’m in college
dont be sad
why go to grad school
grad school is for masochists
I don't want to be a part of a society that is built on pretention
Also someone pinged me
He’s not elitist though
Um well there were door stops for all the bathroom doors and the door to get into the floor and yesterday they all disappeared
I’m hoping the arts one isn’t as competitive
I do not know. It seems it would be a stupid policy considering I have only seen people get hurt by the doors and they make a high touch surface
Well it’s probably still going to be competitive but
That’s still really good though wth
UChicago is insanely hard to get into though
a shame
I can't count
i wish him the best
Really
Don't think you really need to tbf
Tbh good MO theory is killing me
Don't you want to go to med school though?
Next exam tho... 🤡
I texted my ARCD and he said that he didn't know of any new policy so idk
I guess somebody just removed all the door stops lol
OMG CAN I GET A TOUR OF NORTH KOREA
Oh really?
Tbh it really doesn't bother me that much it's just weird that it happened
priyanka and rainy are hydrogen bonds
Lol that'd be ionic bonds tho no?
Molecular is for electron being spread throughout atom tho right due to pi bonds
have you finished the homework for friday ?
Aren’t ionic bonds technically a form of covalent bonding because complete sequestration of electrons is impossible
u cannot escape rainy
while i work
Jenin do be having many simps tho
idk why u people like a girl who says UwU every 3 seconds
ouch
I don’t have pictures of her smh
I SHOULD BE STUDYING CHEM AND BIO WHY AM I HERE
This is so much better than studying
i have 4 assignment overdue bc i fell asleep
but i also want to do my laundry
Someone memorize my amino acids for me
clean clothes > work
ok if you work too hard, you produce lactic acid which burns
wow I never expected to be called a Yankee in my life

never underestimate surprise bodybuilder bod
We may work out but we’re not bodybuilders
He 6 feet 5 and goes to Wyant every day
@sprinkles2108 if rainy was a bodybuilder would u say yes
If I lift half assedly 5/7 days am I even a bodybuilder?
I’m on my phone like
It is; I originally joined discord because my hs friends had installed a rule 34 bot on our server and I wanted to check it out
I’ve stayed ever since
Let's change that. Tell us one thing you hate about Raunak and I will leave
i don't
but i feel like it's porn
I did not need to do that
you don't want to know David
Shame me for my drinking but not for rule 34
Nothing to elaborate on
oh no
He broke your trust
This reminds me of the 3 idiot's couple. Idk y
Which is why my friends wound up searching for the weirdest shit ever
She's going to med school
wont work 😦
The South Korean government recently decreased the maximum workweek from 68 to 52 hours because people there aren't dating enough
Not India tho lol
Population of many Asian nations is estimated in halve by the end of the century
Yeah it's because people in japan are so focused on work and not having babies
Money, lifestyle, institution
most people are bad at balancing
and i need to do my laundry
Guys I’m so sorry for bringing up rule 34
Am I really being shamed rn
sad
someone got rid of it 😦
I wanted that, but the whip will do as a replacement
i will have to scroll far back
If you can find a screenshot
Well I can't add it here but
It should work now
Well it doesn't
Math succ
Math
For exams sadly yes
It says that I need to pay $0.00 by March 9th
math test in 3 minutes 😳
idk if im supposed to come to class or not
he said "i cant make you"
its not like he doesnt understand technology
is so bad
he gives super good review sheets and review problems before every test tho
tfw i started studying last night at 10 pm
I know someone who barely studied in Calculus 3 and still managed to get a B
i mean that depends on ur natural math skill right
some people can get away with 0 studying
depending on the class
and still get an A
ok goodbye
Ran out of time 🤡
I think the 5 different submissions thing is beyond stupid
Makes sense tho
@zackt7718 can you send the “damn bro you got the whole squad laughing” gif/video that you have
Jenine when do you wanna start working on the lab
Math 223 was objectivelt easy
The professor made it easy even if you had little previous knowledge u could hve done good, i was dumb and didnt submit hw on time but i did pretty  good on exams, anyway if u need any help let me know, i have four pages that wrap up pretty much all u need of content
8 hour week is enough, also math 224 woth clark is easy and enough if u dont pursue further calc
I got a 99 on the final and first  exam which is the highest score I've gotten on any exam here
howdy we need to sort out emotes that we don't need 🥺
wdym dont need :thonk:
ones that we don't use much
:benchad::blobboba::blobPumpkin::drivingworm::glock::siptea::spartan::turnip::worm:
i feel we don't use these ones much
Compared to the last few days it’s like summer
yeah i can allow my hands to be exposed to the wind without them freezing instantly UwU
i don;t care
never paid attention to that :D
F and C aren’t very different
C is superior
end of discussion
I don’t do no kizzy kappin

F > C

Oh yeah flutes can’t play chords
Big brain term sorry
Too much for Schubert tho
@ansh8867 can you come into study session
I have a question about #7 on the homework
Which study session tho
Oh, got it
How do you guys stay awake during long dull lectures
u dont
Even Duolingo is sending me the cold emoji now
I remind myself of the consequences of not staying awake
Why is there so much emotional shit involved in friendships? How hard is it? Eesha and Tanvi say we don't have the time or mental strength to deal with you as exams are on. Just talked to them. It's too much man. Some jokes are taken seriously and they think I put other people down
what just happened
Sry, I just have to vent sometimes. It's this feeling in my chest and then I'll be judged if I vent it out elsewhere so decided to do it here. Can't complete anything with that uneasy feeling
Maybe they’re simply busy with exams
Yeah I left, figured I move you to the other channel
I am despicably tired
Hopefully I can stay awake to study for chem some more before failing the exam tomorrow🤡
~~I’m much more scared for bio that I want to cry~~
we love exam week 😆 🔫
Next week is also exam
*we hate it here*
The week following that is also exam
YOU DIDNT GIVE A TRIGGER WARNING
\* me having 5 HMC's on my last homework * 😦
I’m gonna cry
This semester is so much more stressful compared to last semester
anyone tried the luetner made 2 order burritos b4?
Overall, a lot more work compared to last semester
How many credits are you taking?
With or without j term?
Without
Aren’t you taking 18?
STAT 312 is very fun apparently
I heard it’s hard
I don’t have to take R
Oh icic
I want to avoid programming
Damn @_frostyyyyy_ youre going below 18😂
Don’t take engr 131 with bio and chem guys!
Fair
i didnt 😳
Nah I don’t want j term
but then all the school happens at once
I think the only 100-level class I have yet to take is PHYS 124 🥲
I wont^^
Wouldn’t that be hard to schedule though?
Im taking diffeq and MATH 380 tho
CS ain’t bad, y’all can handle neuro as well
We're both going to be in MATH 380 next semester, right?
Which one is math 380?
what is math 380
either it happens or it doesnt
Damn
rip
What about CS with specialization in AI? Main downside is that there are a ton of 400-level classes involved that have a lot of math
rip
400 level classes will probs be hard too
dont underestimate me
idk what the other two subjects would be
is this possible tho
cause the more you have the more overlap there is
STATS and MATH
i thought u were implying i was missing something important
Fuck
Not exactly a start date. They want me to fill an acceptance form first to work all the legal stuff
Does ron work at ksl?

Fax though haven’t had it in years
Coffee on an empty stomach
Is bad
Liquid in general on an empty stomach
Bad
drinking water on an empty stomach boosts metabolism
That doesn’t sound healthy though lol
Eating disorders can cause Erectile Dysfunction though
Drinking water on an empty stomach can give your diet a boost and help in raising the metabolism by 25%.
i dont understand why
ok we dont have to battle. jenin is yours. i cant come in b/w true love

a person cant simp over another within 4-5 days of talking to them online
all my homies hate chem lectures
it would b, but aparently I have an exam
let's hate on chem
If your TA has a google drive where there are previous notes and specific recitation slides, I find that super helpful
I dont think so, but i'll look
Otherwise you may genuinely have to use the textbook. Which isn't bad for this course but you essentially have to submit to the fact the course is just not helpful in it's base state without TA/SI if the textbook is the best option
damn
that bad huh
fuck me
That's worst case scenario if your TA doesn't have the drive setup
But yeah, if you need to use the textbook in a class = L
My bad, if you need to use the textbook in a class because you feel you're drowning otherwise = L
Using textbook otherwise is not bad at all
i wish this campus talked more
which class
i can't imagine this workload with econ :sadcat3:
i don't get it 🤡
I'm a 🤡 and haven't submitted it yet. I'll submit everything in an hour
I still have two hours left
I've finished everything except for the comments... I'm still editing those slightly
Nope
My submission is 900 words so I wouldn't be able to rewrite it on paper without taking an eternity
were we supposed to make an essay?
The true false questions only need one word though
It won’t take more than 20 mins lmao
@nobelium19 Did you put reasoning for your worst case run times for the programming part? Levent says we have to
No, I did not. Please remind me tomorrow to do it because I just studied 4-5 hours for a chem exam tomorrow and I'm putting a moratorium on any other work for the day 🤡
u sound like you're dying
a small reminder to not die
@raunakwastaken we'll have to do the lab report on Thursday, I am going to be drowning in schoolwork and I need Wednesday night/Thursday morning to catch up from lost work due to exams
Kickball is superior because the support roles of tosser and fieldsman require much less work than dodgeball
Complete bio study guide set made by me
They sent all out of order sadly
rainy what time is it in india
Trying to read written doctors orders
women don't have neat handwriting challenge
Just don’t write ever
lmao the phys si literally said "my parents are literally doctors, sorry for my handwriting"
Its 10/10 when u do tho
speaking of notes tho
ban school
no more homework and tests
These are all really nice except for this slide because how you drew the amino acid template makes me upset
I can’t see the attachment which slide is it?
Before I deliver my spiel about how good college is, I want to say a new hot take: I like homework
College has a higher ROI than stocks or bonds
Homework and tests are good because they cause us to study harder
I think they should shift the emphasis on grades more towards homework than tests tho
Nobel said he would rather be a lumberjack than continue on with his college degree
Tell Nobel why he is wrong
Think u mean hemorrhoids idk an rooi
His preference for a career in forestry than an actual college degree
There is a reasoning behind it though, but it doesn't matter until biochem. How you drew it shows only the D-enantiomers of the aa
Then what was the point in saying anything if it didn’t matter yet 😔
We aren’t that smart yet
What if someone did the walking for me
You're fine how it is. There is just a technicality that shows up unfortunately a lot with D,L vs R,S configuration of enantiomerism especially in biochem applications because of the bioavailability and incorporation of cysteine
We banned chemistry didnt u hear
Nobel went to sleep
chem bad
left shark the real mvp
Forbes do b in ksl periodicals tho
Also, I don't have a Twitter account because I think it would primarily have negative effects on me
Grinding so hard that you can’t even be on rise n grind💯 Twitter 😢
I don't know exactly what "Rise and Grind" is, but it probably accurately describes my thinking
If you work hard enough without breaks maybe you’ll die with an extra $10 in ur coffin
LLC Twitter is hilarious yet frightening
omg he does
cuz rising and grinding ron
if ur not rising n grinding u wont get ur .0001% return over 60yrs
I just never rise, imagine rising that takes extra energy you can use mentally grinding 💯😤
its not morning tho
We’re terribly close
The marginal utility of an extra hour of sleep if you get below 6 hours is greater than the extra hour of working if you do not get more sleep
it wasnt that small loan of 1mil dollars
Netflix do be expensive tho that shit $13/month wtf
I like the "costs watching Netflix and going out to dinner" part but the story seems too dramatic. There do need to be sacrifices for success though
I used to watch TV every day before I started college and now I don't have any time. I sometimes watch some entertainment on weekends
I don't really watch any YouTube videos right now
Chem isn’t real
we'll work on that goal on alternating thursdays
It really do be
Me when I have to wake up tomorrow for my 8am class
not as much as they used to be
if you havent slept on a couch or recliner, you havent lived
Can cause pressure ulcers though
As long as it isn’t stage 2+
That’s worse than tinder
I fail to see why that's important
I mean with tinder at least ur sad n lonely, what level of depraved do u need for LinkedIn gold
I don't know
I don't believe in astrology
you might need to fite jenin over that one
So I think it’s saying to fuck
banana means your tophat is left over from the suns left ear
Ouch
And w astrology everything only goes down
I got owned on Discord. 

So I went to my computer, and typed up a new resume. 

When I was going outside to the Den, a guy stopped me and asked me for a cigarette. I don't smoke, but I instead gave him 20 dollars, and told him to buy a suit, and get a job. 

He had a dog. The dog took the 20 dollars. 

When the dog stood up, it was actually 2 people in a dog suit.
If the stock market is just a casino, then why do financial companies pay quants and analysts so much money? 🤔
Rich ppl aren’t immune
He's on death row noe
Is my final guess
If you didn't choose the Legion ur weird
the stock market/gambling is the same thing as day drinking or getting handouts from the government, classy if you rich, trashy if ur poor
Isn’t that the whole thing wsb is going thru
and that the rich people are trying to stop them from taking their money
so hard that they break the law
and nothing happens
I didn’t wanna choose the gun emoji but u did it anyway smh
work up the chain
What the fuck
Nah that’s annoying lemon
Cuz of annoying orange
you have a diff memory to Annoying orange than I do
Don’t have a memory Bc I never watched it dw
Death couldn't stop me from the grind. 

I used my soul to get the materials to build a toll booth. 

After working day and night with my disembodied, ghostly limbs aching in pain when I thought pain was no longer an issue. 

I finally had it. A toll road right before the divergence between heaven, hell, and limbo. 

I charged a flat fee of everyone's age at death cubed, times the amount of chambers in their heart at death. 

God himself shuddered at my ectoplasmic fortune. 

He came to me, and asked me, in a deep and knowing voice, "Where did you learn of these techniques, and how do I not own this road already?"

I pondered my reply. Classic marketing technique; I didn't need time. I had the answer. 

"My lord, LinkedIn Premium. Now available for a student discount of 30% off for 6 months."

God looked at me. 

I stared right back. 

He narrowed his eyes. 

I held my gaze strong. 

19 Irishmen jumped out of the folds of his cloak, and pulled out Shillelaghs. I shuddered in fear, but remembered that fear isn't a luxury that I had. It was unprofitable, and demotivating. 

I raised my head, struck a fighting pose. 

128 more irish furries were behind me and I didn't realize. They beat my extracorporeal form into a bloody, ghostly ooze, and I burst into a million golden rings, like sonic when he dies.
Omg Wolfgang reference
The grind never ends 💀

The two languages I wish I knew at least conversationally are Mandarin and Spanish
K I don’t know any Spanish
How hard is arabic for a native English speaker
Cuz I know mandarin is really hard as a native English speaker
in speaking
people mostly find difficulties with pronouncing several letters
not to mention general pronunciation but we don't talk about that
Mandarin is hard for native mandarin speakers
don't
cuz u just know these
there are some patterns tho
my brain is dead so i don't quite get what you're saying
Der kleiner Hund
Die kleine Katze
Das kleines Mädchen
But then that gets really messy really quickly
i've only been in the intro arabic class for a few weeks, but pronouncing certain letters has been the most difficult so far

Also the space seems congested?
I don’t know
Are you on campus tho or you're saying this from virtual tour?
Ok. For late night studies, there is this guy playing the piano and it's so loud that you can't concentrate only. If you're with friends, then it's a good vibe. If you're alone it's depressing af
For studying at least
I'm in my second semester and I haven't the slightly clue of how any buildings and their interiors on campus look 🤡
Same tho 🤡 😔
You haven’t even stepped foot in an est place lolllllllll

Pain is all I feel

Oh yeye
ron doesnt even know her own coworkers smh my head
I don’t
to be fair I havn't even completed the hiring form
I mean the way I managed my time was that I built my class schedule partially around how I planned to work
And then I get work done ahead for multiple reasons, but it helps especially when I have to squeeze in work
GME went back up today i just saw
Ukno what I just realized Howdy
Because like 3 weeks ago I got an email about my onedrive being at capacity

Oh in my experience freshmen who are super negative about everything here hold a deep resentment towards a school they wanted to go to more
I am trying to make those who are not on campus jelly. That's the intent coz we just discussed about Peter Lewis building.
My bad
want to be really jelly?
But poor raunak is not here 🥺 why make it worse for him 🥺
I may be missing out on campus but at least I get to eat my mother’s home-cooked food
Fair, but in a time like this I can’t really go anywhere anyway
Aww
rip ansh
rip
@toomanyzs if you ever need someone to cuddle with, lemme know
Not gonna lie. I empathize more with the age 21 drinking age after 2.5 years of this job, and in this setting. People tend to 1. not know their limits 2. disturb others 3. the independence leads them to panic when things go wrong 4. seriously hurt themselves 5. develop bad habits to cope with stress
Something about alc concentration? I don’t remember
Well Ansh, that's all fun and games but on Saturday I had EMTs here in my building because I had a kid who drank until he was sick, and then when he was throwing up he passed out and hit his head on the bathroom floor, and his friends left him in panic, and another student found him.
Someone else had
Dang not leaving the scene of the crime
I can’t even manage a sip of beer I hate it that much
I don't drink at all. I'm not that types. Trust me
It tastes shit
it used 2 b 18 i think back in nam era
@ansh8867 I didn’t know you drink alcohol
like do u know how many people have prolly died from overdrinking cause their freinds didnt want to take them in and get caught
I don't
Only in America can you die in battle but can't drink at the age of 18
It IS Legal. At age 21. When people have the ability to behave themselves more accordingly. As a 21 year old who lives with all 17 18 and 19 year olds, and has for his entire college career, there is an EXTRAORDINARY amount of development and maturation that occurs
do what u want, not my prob
I can’t even stand a sip it’s that bad lol
That was sent at the wrong moment 😐
With coke, you never know
theyre definitely is, i think your brain continues to mature untiul like ~25 but my point is that even if you "ideally" shouldnt be drinking until 21, maybe the age should still be lower since people are gonna do it anyway
why they do that? now lame people live 3 years longer 😦
I'm really dumb
the rum n coke went to the brain
he  cant even read ra
what are u trying to say @toomanyzs
Don't complain
oh im stupid
idc if u smoke due to bad event, or because u want to. do what u want; old enough to know
cant you?
I get screwed for small shit like eating in common room area
Ok, I'm sorry
I'll never touch it again
Ansh too late buddy Zach already submitted the report
But you can’t even do dorm searches can u
Here's the other deal; I don't write reports on retroactive stuff except for a couple of clauses
then why havent written up rainy for bullying me. he said i like a girl and called me a respectable person :((((
oh i thought title 9 just said schools and stuff couldnt be sexist
go study
i mean sexual harrasment and sexual assault arent really title 9 are they i mean those are just already illegal
I should be working on matlab🥲
but rather i'm shitposting on discord
imagine having a brain and being able to study
But I don’t know matlab🥲
couldnt b me
oh fuck thats due in 2 days
I don't have any midterms this week 😎
You didn’t have to flex like that🥲 I only have 1 though
If you ever say that again I will hug you very hard
Because discord wants a nickname smart one
I'm really dumb at times so I can't even think about doing anything. I'm in my room
ansh u really want to get Zach to write u up
no, just test week
week(s)
it first exam or tests
I said I don't mean to be racist
Actually leave it
I used to hear lot of shit in India with bullying and all
“I don’t mean to be racist BUT...” goes on to say something racial
I just said those TA's tend to be strict at times. Since everyone was pissed with their grade etc.

Are you a female looking for a handsome, charming man with a lot of $$$? Like, so much money that homie will pay for tinder? Well, I got just the opportunity for you! This is truly once in a lifetime opportunity, it's romantic as fuck. I promise. 

Must be OK with dating a 5'5 gamer who goes by NoBitchWitt, and also must have reliable transportation to Kent, OH. DM if interested. Serious inquiries only.

I’d be in the hospital rn if I decided to take off work
Redistribute some of the pain to me comrade
*isnt that most of them through history :P*
Ain’t that just libertarianism
That agenda wouldn’t let me communize my pain :banhammer:
bro same tho but im already sleepy
@nobelium19 what did you think of the chem exam?
Well I did excellent on the multiple choice but couldn't remember what attractions are between atoms in ionic or covalent bonds
In other words I definitely missed points on the FRQ but I'm basically guaranteed a B so I'm vibing
I think I missed 4 points on the MC but I really don't know
Aiiiiiieee I missed points then
ionic i almost messed up but my answer could very well be wrong
No it isn't, then it doesn't add up
oh crap that means i didn't do so good on the mc then
rip!
Well idk but there's 4 points missing then
well then the most i can get on this exam is an 86🤡
well at least it's only one exam
B isn't even that bad, if you average a B on all exams I'm pretty sure you still get an A in the class
I've done a bit of  106 in 111 so i dont think itll be too bad
The second and third exams are more difficult though, right?
yes it's very much possible since my exam scores were 83, 67, and 63 in 105 and still managed to get an A
cuz i grinded so hard for the final
I got 84s on 2/4 of the MATH 122 exams and still managed to get an A
@nobelium19 im muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh more scared for bio
that class' grading is brutal
drop the lowest exam grade
So i dont think an 85+ will be a B
In the end
i did well on the 3 exams in math 126 and slacked off on the final
Idk lmaooooo
math helps him connect with god
I only got a 95.7 so I feel like a 🤡 right now
but they don't matter much
Tbh if you follow Drew Meyer to the T i dont think CHEM 106 will be hard
Meyer didn't teach but I thought his class wasn't too complicated and was easy to study for
Like I said if you follow his instructions it wont be too bad
Sadly, the Java API doesn't give runtimes for LinkedList methods, only ArrayList methods
I looked it up on the internet lol
I didnt cite 😬
I couldnt come cause I was wrapping up PHYS lab
Dammit i shouldve gone
Aw thats unfortunate
I'm up to the chin with work
Yeah I feel the same
Oh shit
I would still try to work through the problems before looking at the solution
i have everything else, but my brain wont function correctly anymore. Should I make a new linked list/array list in the method and put all unique (non copied) name/phones in? Or do I have to actually remove the duplicates
public class Queue{
Queue meme_queue;
....
void remove_duplicate(){
meme_queue.remove_duplicate();
}
}
It’s school day
ugh. are u also in the class
just someone in our class
ahaha but i don't break this server's rules !
i DoNt bReAk tHiS sErvEr’S rULeS
do you want to: 😂
I need to remove this troll label
i still haven't memorized my amino acids! :D
exam is on monday!
You guys got your exams graded already for chem
i miss biol 214
Yeah I got a 99.5 but I think I can argue back the thing I missed
215 is pain for a smol brain like me
What a guy. Which exam?
the amount of geniuses at this school
You got a 98.6 or someone else?
they gotta simp for linkedin first tho
Damn you’re really that guy huh
Um I hate to be that guy but I got you all beat 😎
Unfortunately it doesn't matter
didnt you get over 100
Yes but it doesn't matter
The irony omg
nobel got over 100 in that class
if ur not out here with a 72, you're doing it wrong
On the flip side, I hate coding and am not a CS major
So you don't plan to take anymore CS classes?
@nobelium19 im gonna fail this bio exam
Ansh why didn't you take 131 ?
How are you gonna fail? That seems unlikely
Cameron we have HW due friday
you have no idea how much i don't know
SOMEONE TEACH ME MATLAB
simply dont use matlab
i feel bad for bombarding michael with smol brain questions tho
Students will ignore SIs, TAs and tutors, and then wonder why there aren't more resources
we don't have to do a few problems
Why have anxiety? What's the worst that could happen?
fair but still
I can't eat jackshit for the time till the exam
I'm always worried about failing all my classes
im worried about that and other things
Oh yh. I can't talk in my SAGES class openly because of that
just simply dont have a mic
i almost forgot what i had to say
doesnt matter in the end
Matters if you want to go to grad school
simply dont go to extra school like a fool
Look if I'm not studying and wasting a shit ton of time like a week before the exam, I get this dream in my sleep about how I took that exact exam and failed it
i didn't turn it into a contest
I didn’t understand your sentence or what you were referring
Why are you still awake then?
Because I have WORK
oh i just looked it up. i wouldn't know the word cuz my parents didn't use it much around me
When you don't get your stuff done, we generally find make-shift solutions for it and just do it in the heat of the moment. That ways
Nvm this joke was stupid
@sprinkles2108 I thought you had to go to study?
no he really can't lol
Priyanka you would hurt me like this 😭
Ranbaxy the one that was bad
God no. Haldi ka dood. Everything goes away
ehhhh i don't really like it
Haldi ka dood is wierd. I used to have that chawanprash thing coz my parents thought it will improve eyesight
God, it's so bad
Aside from necessary vaccinations I have never used antibiotics
Even sporlac for a stomach ache as a child. I have to hold my nose and just drink it
i still have my writing skills for hindi
im very slow at reading hindi tho
i learned how to write in hindi in elementary school
too bad hindi is the only indian language we speak
I know how to speak hindi fluently from just listening to my parents. I was never formally taught. One of the skills I never understand how I got till date
Early age language acquisition!
Study that
sir you're not even enrolled yet how are you in groupme's
What happened?
I got my fair share for it
Pls don't bring it up
Prions are scary
Holy shit they're awful
thats that mad cow stuff right
Am I missing something?
oh about prions?
I also want to know about that
There are also those Amoebas that just are chilling in random bodies of water and eat your brain if you go swimming and people just still jump in ponds and creeks and shit
Moss, it happened during physics class
I already discussed about it technically like last sem
Oh
yeah that happened to me too
@kaori_flute shouldn’t we be sleeping?
Wherever I go, someone or the other has a problem with a certain thing I say. In India, we won't care but I understood how I intensified the message of intent instead of lowering it
go to sleep demons
imma study bio until 2 and call it a night
im really setting myself up for failure
@raunakwastaken at this point
i won't guarantee morning phys lec 🤡
It's fine. The exam is next week. You have the whole weekend to prepare
yes but a weekend isn't enough for someone like me
also @ansh8867 my house is chaotic so i def won't have quality study time this weekend🤡
But he hasn’t confirmed
I have class till 11:15 AM
Where do the study sessions take place anyways
Bruh wasn't yesterday wednesday
12:30? It's worse than 12:00 but still acceptable
he doesnt knoooooooo
I sentence you to CHEM 322. I don't make the rules, sorry. You now have class until 6
Mine looks so scuffed
nobel, you never used the sis calander?
This is for what class
fam i dont even know what's going on in intro bio
Nope sorry you have CHEM 322 now as well
I'm also supposed to do Bio in some time frame between 11:15 and 4 and if we do it at 1 Idk what will happen
don't have energy
i can't at 1
Too bad. You have Chem 322 to do
@nobelium19 do you wanna skip data structures and wanna work then?
Nope I don't skip class
chem is the best ~~even tho i didnt get an A on today's exam so F~~
1. You don't even know yet lol
2. Stop worrying about the exams
hold up don't you have a bio exam today
fair
Bruh I miss Drew Meyer's meditation sessions 😢
Um well he doesn't do them anymore
That's the only time we got for first exam
I don't think they have a choice
Can't help it
I believe university policy says they can't take it outside of 10:30pm
Ok i need to sleep now
ig he doesn't want people cheating
From what I've heard 2024 has a really bad cheater problem
someone openly cheated during one of my math quizzes
afaik i don't have to use lockdown this smester :LAUGHING:
also, our exams are online. that should be enough to explain it
couldnt be me
even if i wanted to collaborate, i have ZERO, and i mean ZERO trust with people
Tbh I think open note is the way to go, just make it open note but make the time limit very restrictive or something idk
tlddr dont cheat
or dont
i dont cheat lol
i don't recommend
cause theres way less reason to cheat
Open note but hard as fuk
cuz timed tests, as learned through drew
my psych exams are open note
never given enough time for smol brains
we dont havethe brain power to cheat
Sorry
I feel a disturbance in the force
My ENGR 145 is open-note. That means hard af
ik someone in my sages class from last semester who took engr 145 last semester and when i heard the exams were open-note i was like BROOOOOOOO
I beg to differ. His mid-term was the most time-crunched exam
ansh, speaking of 145, for 9, what needs to b calculated?? i just listed the things as ionic or covelent
people at my friend's college can literally look at their notes or ask for help on the test
but it's very time-constirctive
u can barely do all the questions even without any resources
i dont know that any of that means zach
Oh shit I know what that is
I dont
Don't take the mask off of the ideal gas equation, because what you find you won't like
i didnt even know that
Which one of you big brain math kids does Fourier transforms by hand
isnt that a photoshop filter
But that was just the click of a button away
You just look at him and you go “awww”
Apparently he’s a Vizsla
I have literally never heard about that breed of dog until today
I can't believe I'm awake
Why? Did you get enough sleep?
7 hours should be enough for many college students
Just go back to sleep then
Can't just can't
I woke up out of panic a few times between the hours of 5 am and 7 am
I had a dream last night in which I failed my homework
wtf was that
a fucking fire drill?
Here lemme hug you
does it matter i think u need a hug
@.fim. hug
Someone set off the fire alarm and it's damn annoying
Some guys actually have a math exam rn so they would be pissed
Done with Math Group Work
Tink back entrance. The one near NRV
Don't know about today but they were giving it away yesterday
Rip
Are you participating in that tho?
But the challenge was hard ASF
What was it? Study for 5 hours on the 3rd floor?
Bad joke my b
It was never going to b used well
I didnt

But instead I only saw pics that my sister and dad took
Howdy doesn’t have insta
I hate road sickness and hilly roads
But have gone to many hilly places like Shimla, Wayanad, Ooty , Pondicherry etc.
There's a DaddyDrew instagram page, why can't there be a Howdy page
there are games though

Well, too bad

I would simply leave zoom
I’ve never done an escape room though
I wish laser-tag was here
@kaori_flute wtf happened??
But rona closed them
Weren’t you two supposed to meet
oh
I don’t leave people on read
The first one I tried it’s a bunch of cards and you add them up to get the numbers for other cards
i did not realise my phone was still opened
If you don’t do it right you lose time
Sorry I should be studying
:0 oh nooo
Yeah rip
Imagine studying
We. Have. To. Study. For. Physics.
You don't
I hardly studied for first exam
covault says that the first exam will be 5%
Okay I have to fix my wifi. I’ll be back
Well I can say that for math 126
But im no longer in 126
Can’t say it anymore🥲🥲🥲
@nobelium19 mondays exam will reveal my ultimate smol brain
~~i am no brain, so i don't belong in small brain~~
Same tho
i have 47 minutes left raunak
@ansh8867 do you want to go over the HW right now ?
Cry in peace and I'll come back 😂😂
So wishes etc. Accidental press
i'm hungry
sorry
Eggplant parmesan goes hard
I don't use Tinder. Like never
math exam was kind of brutal, but it was my own fault 🥲
Which math class is this?
126. the exam was mostly integral applications
must fix study schedule
Did someone ghost ping me?
Why did Tanvi leave this server?

fuck
isn't Alp one of the material science professors?
Drew’s shit
Drew's instagram though?
Am currently taking a chem class 😔
Tired of learning about charges
tired of not learning cuz theres something w/ chem teachers and being unable to teach
Not really. Hey, you don't insult my class like that. I love fluorescent lights and the band gap energy. Use gamma rays and you can't knock the electrons in my brain.
Drew is super knowledgeable about chem that even if you don’t understand one of his explanations then he’ll explain a concept to you in a different way
If only you went to office hours you’d agree with me
Drew is not bad it’s just we’re taking chem during a pandemic
Sometimes there’s a problem with super knowledgeable and passionate profs where they have a hard time simplifying concepts I think
drew doesnt want to teach basic chem, and so he didnt
he got paid tho, and gamed the system
so i cant be mad in that regard
cuz he got paid for doing nothing
He doesn’t get in trouble because many survived his class last semester
But ALEKS is helpful so at least he facilitated a resource (even though we had to pay for it)
No it doesn’t
Nope. Just saying that he’s not a bad prof at all
The students are dumb if they don't understand what I'm saying. I emphasize the readings and go slow in class. We behind portions also
I’m worried that Alp and the man behind Alp are being merged into an Alp hybrid of sorts
isnt that a dessert
Eclairs slap tho
I don’t remember which ones
i cant say i've had one tho qq
French baking hard tho
Ugh now I wanna cook
Cant fool me 🤨
You see this. It's the Besan burfi's Ansh gave me. Only reason I come 15 minutes late to class is coz of this. It excites me
I wouldn’t make dessert tho
so alp, why dont you give me the answers to q7
Because Alp wants to facilitate learning
Because that’s what I miss the most rn
ron after not having spicy food for 4months
Dumping hot sauce and cayenne  on everything isn’t enough
Customs got nothing on him
I forgot ketchup smh
I’m disappointed
Yea I forgot ketchup, but remembered hot sauce
last semester i went through 2+ bottles of bbq
Thu. Indian lays are shit
Have you had American lays before though?

@ansh8867 i thought you had office hours at 11:30

Rain, rain, go away
Rain, rain, go away

When was daddy wants to play in the song?
Omg
what do you need help with
Exams
That’s not everything though
It’s a valid complaint though
For CSDS 132 last sem
His main chess game didn't work
Sir I don’t know how to code that🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I don’t even love myself man
rip
I don’t
You didn't come only. Scam
Raunak do not hurt this man
He hasn’t started teaching
Economics is not boring though
It's so bad. I legit cried in IG
money
Rip @ansh8867
Sigh
raunak there’s only so much a sperm bank will buy
that’s a bad business plan smh
There are multiple banks tho
The world needs more Chinese and Indians
I didn’t know fishes are this kinky
Yh and he's like my research is better than Darwin's barnacles as it doesn't have genitalia and he wasted 8 years on that
*the barnacles don't have
cuz i never watched those
im gonna help you save time and say that i didn't watch 10/14 lectures and still did fine. textbook>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Does he repeat prior topics in his other exams
I feel the next topics should be better. I hated evolution in hs also. It's so boring
next exam will focus on transcription and translation
you will learn to connect those concepts back to evolution tho
I'll go to his office hours once and sort it
they helped me reinforce concepts tho
I miss Grayson and Sriya
I don't understand natural selection under ideal conditions.
But he hasn't discussed the genetics of that yet
you will learn that for exam 2 iirc
Yh, I wrote that. Still got couple MCQ's wrong
rip his wording can be vague
If a country's fertility rate is below ~2.1 and they don't have a lot of immigrants, population decline is inevitable
it helps to actually have an interest in the subject tho
Still a lot of people left over but rip
That could change since some Asian nations are trying to encourage people to have more children
I might be part of the problem because I’ve never wanted children
Still don’t
There would be slight increase tho. But at bare minimum when relatively compared to other country's population's growth expansion and fertility rate
That is if I don’t die alone
that's good. get them out of the broken foster system
im worried about that too LOL 🥲
the .1 is accounting for childhood mortality that occurs even in very developed nations so a few people won't make it to the age to have children
Nigeria has 200 million people and has a fertility rate of 5.4 children per woman so it seems possible that their population increases to 800 million by the end of the century like some people are projecting
What’s the child mortality rate in Nigeria tho
Like I don’t want to assume it’s high just because it’s in Africa
1/8 or 12.5% of Nigerians die before the age of 5
Ok it seems like child mortality doesn’t seem to curb population
ooh @raunakwastaken I forgot about wandavision
So I think Asia doesn’t want to have children out of sociological reasons
The younger generation seems to be rejecting more conservative “family values”
Yeah so child mortality isn’t a factor if Asia’s population is halving
It's already starting in Korea https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/south-korea-population-falls-for-first-time-in-history
yes and gen z hates the world rn so they don't want their children to experience the harsh world
I think it’s more to do with I don’t want to be trapped in a family _just yet_
We’re not really the generation to hate marriage and children we just seem to not want to rush into it like our grandparents and their ancestors did
If people think that 2021 is harsh then I'd like to hear what they think of every previous year of human history... smartphones, cars, computers, healthcare, minimal war, long lives, near universal access to education, etc.
my parents were in their late 20's when they had me and they were considered 'late'
To want to procreate ASAP
some people like to complain endlessly and not appreciate the good stuff. yes, there are problems that need to be addressed, but don't hate on EVERYTHING smh
but i hate it when people complain about EVERYTHING
work to bring forth reform but stopppp
It's funny when everything that people complain about was actually a lot worse in the past
hahahaha you think i complain about everything but it's really just school which is universal among young people
People in Africa are still having a lot of kids... in some Asian nations people had a lot of kids for some time but then stopped
Still more men?
Saying that the USA is bad is just ridiculous, people from all around the world want to live here to work and study
the democratic socialists argue that other European countries like Switzerland are much better. I agree that we can implement some of their measures in this country but come on, it could be worse
@fbi don’t @ me
social issues however I’m pretty left
but on stuff like guns I’m not as left
I’m a hard no on gun lobbyists and I find school shootings appalling but I don’t think you can just ban guns period
I would describe myself as a centrist though
Yeah I have a hunch that people in Asia don’t think matters of government can be easily considered overreach
Isn’t that what they do for politicians
They calculate their inclinations on issues and then find the mean
Apparently Sanders is a centrist and Biden is an authoritarian rightist according to this website
i wish some questions had a neutral answer :cursed_flushed:
Bush didn’t even make it lol
@_frostyyyyy_ im still here
Bush didn't run in 2020
We're both close to the center then
Trump and Biden are unsurprisingly close to each other
Have you taken this yet? https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/quiz/political-typology/
This is enough proof that we shouldn’t idolise politicians
like we said, we were happy that trump lost, and not that biden won
SORRY
this test isn't very accurate tbh
Faith in science? Idk
i still think im more of a centrist
I don't like talking about politics a lot since it tends to divide people
that's fair
Had america been too far left your dot would likely shift to the right
I hate politics and I'm 60 messages behind. Too much to read
Apparently I'm Bernie Sanders
Ngl I didn't know what some of the questions were asking so I just said "agree"
same tho
Sam you’re even more far left than Hawkins
How are you so left wing tho
and want fairness in society
I would consider Indian parents to be little left wing but not too much
left??? more like right
fair enough
It’s usually the young who are more left
I'm kinda influenced by my parents but that doesn't work here
I don't shit on Modi. That's all I'll say about India
in america? yeah it does still
@raunakwastaken get on discord we need to finish this lab report
i mean most people just get more conservative fiscally because they get richer and dont want to be taxed cause theyre selfish
but theres no reason to hate gay people even if youre old
That’s just like how not all people in China overseas shit on Xi
couldnt b me
Lol. I don't have much Indian political background
love how nehru didn't want india to join the UN🥰
is nehru cringe? idk much about him
nehru is the worth thing that happened to india and you should hate him
When my friends said Gandi is a rapist, I lost all my beliefs then and there
Wasn’t MLK also a perv _apparently_
let me emphasise the “apparently” here
the UN wanted India to join as the 5th power, but nehru was like OMG NO LET CHINA JOIN OMG NO WE DONT WANNA JOIN like how stupid could he have gotten
oh yeah thats kinda cringe ig? i mean idk as things go thats not bad like the un doesnt rly matter that much
China doesn't want India to join the UN so that's why it's frustrating. Also, India would've been better off if they joined the UN
idk if it would warrant saying hes the worst thing that ever happened to india
unless he did other bad stuff too
like this seems dumb more than like evil
why yall wasting ur time on the political compass lol that thing sucks
you have very strong opinions about some politican who died 60 years ago
Omg
if you want to
ive taken it before it puts me near the bottom left corner, but a more accurate one would put me near the top left corner
fr like wtf does astrology have to do with anything
*Its like the personality tests, fun to meme about, but dont take it seriously to base anything off of*
I forgot mine
don’t @ me
Sounds like something I would need to know for med school
dont take it
Um I want to know what personality I have
I feel like I’ve developed multiple personality disorder from Myers Briggs
Wonder what happens if you don't have one
Guess we'll find out
goddamit why does that car alarm keep going off

Ngl, it's hilarious and sad that no one at the math club is only majoring in math
apparently nobel and i are like bernie
but the test doesn't mean anything
@_frostyyyyy_ I dare you to say math majors are lame 💀
I could only go through three of them properly and then I just got tired
still dont take it seriously
it has IMO *too* many categories tho
8 seems unnecessary
finn, smh my head
I just answered approximately, the questions aren't too complicated. if I took more time it might be more accurate
oh fuck
its been so long since ive eaten bread
wtf
I got libertarian right on one test and social democracy on another which are basically opposites so I don't think these tests are useful
libertarianism isnt really real??? so...
i cant unsee
guess i'm fake :D
I’m v creative when it comes to stupid things
gif broken 4 me
does a bagel count tho
It's premium tho
I actually saw in the OT, a guy who had his testicle stuck in his abdomen
@ansh8867 do you have a missing testicle?
@nobelium19 looks like Finn and Zack aren’t going to like us for much longer 😔
Its not a car alarm, its the alarm on the basketball courts if you don't closeit
We aren’t based 😩
I don't understand based
the civil axis should be more towards authority tho IMO
Priyanka can't make decisions, even in her views lol
what's wrong with some traditional values?
theyre shit
thats what wrong with them
im progressive but still hold on to some traditional values
@ansh8867 turn your camera on
traditional values literally correlate with like nearly everything bad
i want some regulation. so what? some people are crazy
finn, dont tell me ur taking the buzzfeed quizes seriously
It seems like pro progress is our common trait
that comment doesnt rly make sense cause were using it as a starting point for actual conversations about more serious things
I don’t think he attacked u he just hates tradition which is fair
Some traditions are truly awful
Hot take: talking about politics isn't productive
@chandachan You're a TA for ENGR131, someone needs help for that class
you know youve said something wrong when the discord mod agrees with u
Hot take: Talking ~~about politics~~ isn't productive
i feel attacked
Are most people on this server libertarian left?
Damn that’s aesthetically pleasing
@sprinkles2108 Can't say anything now
i get lib left on the chart, but im actually auth-left
it just means i want a powerful govt
it just shouldnt be more powerful than it is democratic
Damn what a pivot
which I find preposterous
We wouldn’t be obsessed with foreign wars if it wasn’t for corporatism
The only test I like although it's kinda bad but yh
Just tried again and got this
GroupMe is bad but I have to use it because of the network effect
you dont have to do anything
Ultimate comeback to parents saying “you don’t need it”
Don’t need anything and I’ll just die
Wanna be comrades but won’t share my pain ic how it is
never heard of her
why do you hate my cat
what's wrong with the cat?
I haven't talked here in over a month and the first thing somebody says is to die
Cat did nothing wrong, except be born into my pain sharing society
ron leave my cat alone
Sorry Seba you came in like the protagonist in a post apocalyptic film
We’re trying to pick up the pieces
With my pain communist society
Oh Tanvi
MacBeth Can’t Breathe

sorry bro
Ball is life tho
we need to watch wednesdays lecture
nobel wont watch with us
cause he watches it in 1.5x
I don't want another Soviet Union
anarchism doesnt work 🤦‍♀️
what do u want then
Legend types at 119 wpm. He's bound to find everything slow around him
yeah the issue was just the leadership was super undemocratic so they didnt listen to anyone else
rip the aral sea :cri:
im not too familiar w/ it tho
10 more than u needed tho 💔
*middle school
I'm studying Chinese and Zhanda is studying French
Duolingo Chinese isn't very good but I don't have anything else better to do when I'm cleaning my teeth
also, the reason zhanda and i have less texts is cause we've deleted so many of them
Duolingo Chinese is horrible
We need to complete this triumvirate
I didn't even go through the module at all and directly took the quiz. These MCQ's are so misleading then @sprinkles2108
oh okk
wdym misleading? like they don't match the exam? i mean, they are just to check your knowledge. not apply what you learned
It's in 15 mins. I don't know the order yet
yeah the lab is due today
are you still doing the post-class covid test?
why does ksl close so early :sadcat3:
I explained shit we didn't even learn. Went a bit extra on DNA isolation explaining negative charge of Dna, phospholipid bilayer etc.
@sprinkles2108 This whova shit spammed my inbox
raunak cant
Right testicle is annoying
Which class requires you to do presentations? Biology lab?
I'm bored

I don’t think anyone here understands Hindi
Except a couple of us
how hard could it be?
Don't insult
I’m reporting you. Expect a call from office of equity
English is a refined language and somehow in India, some people feel it can reflect your status ( more for priveleged etc)
i have heard that in india you're considered uneducated if you don't know english but idk how true that is
Not really. You can know Hindi also and still pass JEE exams or go to IIT
Anyways, those exams are in Hindi
My dad went to MIT
Oh LMFAO
omg i havent had some in like 3 years :(
I have never been to the shop
labs are due at midnight anyone who gets them in at 8pm is an overacheiver
is it as short as it looks
lmk if you need help
oh it depends on where you are measuring distance is from
yeah but aren't we supposed to do it for each individual pair of points
@chandachan bruh I literally yelled your name and you didn’t look up
because the groupme normies don't use cord
The answer is that you use it because other people use it. It doesn't matter if the functionality of Discord is better if most students don't use it
dang i wish i had that emote downloaded
yall still aint done? embarassing
when u have 2 things due in one night
i still have some soc stuff to do ughhhh

you can't stop me
@bravo5127What are you doing on a plane
more accurately tho
Math tells me 10
math hard
Idk
A shooting on the main road seems bad
yea nothing serious
Ngl, a shooting on Euclid a week after a robbery seems quite bad
at least we aren't jordan, utah
when the weather is warmer, crime is a foot
u know most cities arent like this right?
needs more snow
you're a mad man
Sorry to yall small city folk ig
always wanted to do a showdown on Euclid ave
most major cities arent like this either 🤦‍♀️
Damn where u be going lol
wrong reply
Why aren't major cities more like this?
Also I forgot Chicago
thats cuz the reply feature sucks
ron, where do i find more details about the hunt?
Owo you didn’t get an email
Bro if you think that one shooting in a metro area of well over a million people is confirmation that everything is terrible and dangerous then you should go home.
i cant tell if ur joking or u didnt read any of my messages
they aint fraid of no ghost
if i cant open fire on a big mac, then what is america?
idk tbh havent been to uw in a while
Not a real place if there isn’t

Ukno that super big drug crisis everyone’s been worried abt for the last decade?
2 decades actually damn
I have almost never seen a needle on the ground in Houston
dont need to be afraid of HIV if make sure you already have it 🧐
Have you tried searching tho
Maybe you haven’t looked hard enough?
less than seattle but still
@.fim. apparently cleveland is among one of the most dangerous cities in america
You can find needles anywhere, there isn’t a needle autonomous zone lol
im dead
Me when I walk into the hospital
Sorry I am a needle autonomous zone
Still need me?
my mama need her bill money my son need some milk
Never waste the sticks like that
*Never ever* taint the sticks

They are in short and precious supply
No stick in taint either

See it’s people like you that we can create a fair trading society
i want to make a mess on myself

Ron if you ever want some juicy ~~cocaine~~ pineapple just HMU
i guess my japanese professor didnt like me using spanish

but they left the roll in the open
guess who now owns a roll of bubble wrap
cuz i popped them all
at my HS some students threw a bed into our pool and broke the pool covers, which cost the school 100k
I was abt to say wtf but then what uve said abt ur schooling history came back in a whoosh
Damn the TSO grab and go got sold out quickly wtf
And blankets apparently
It was sold out and then I refreshed and there was a spot open
They just cut the friendship. Eehs and Tanvi said our wavelengths don't match. Everywhere I go, I'm just rejected. Either it's due to some racial reason or just general personality. I'm not a shit person. I try to be my best and help people. My dad also knows their parents. What do they? Friends for life my fkin foot. They're the absolute worst. Just give me emotional torture and don't give two shits about me. I can't even make friends properly. It doesn't work like this. Why is it unfair to me? Little things add so break a valuable friendship. One time I got angry only. Emotionally draining they say. :cri: :blobloveslep:
Damn dude leave them

Fortunate for me, I have nothing due
I have a math quiz due before 8 AM tomorrow
trooper wtf
aren't you done with lab 2 as well?
Same class?
Damn
Im surprised how chill my class are compared to last semester
yeah but im still spending time re-checking everything 3x b/c I can't read lab protocols to save my life
i had one thing i was stuck on and then once my TA helped me she said im done and i could turn it in LOL
@Deleted User still, good to recheck everything tho
Also EE computer software track
No need to long functions and sintaxis for a simple operation
Yeah, I forgot what it's called but it's the BME computing specialization
I have homework due in 80 minutes and a math quiz due in 10 hours, why am I here
Cause you got pinged
Which math quiz?
MATH 307: Linear Algebra
Man pingin just minutes before most deadlines in the week is like t posing someone stressing over work
No gonna take more math lol
you don't have to do an actual signature?
Aerospace majors only have to take 4 math classes?
I didnt😬
I'm going to go study for my quiz now
Bye
He left
ngl we require the math classes
Math is ew
sorry
Math or coding
I still use print statements to debug like a 🤡
I really need to fix that soon
@chandachan where did the left testicle go?
it fell off
rip
we need to stick it tonight

Damn that's really not m
Fuck
Aren’t you the building with the dog on the third floor
I don’t mean fat
Or from what I saw from the distance because I totally wasn’t inside Tyler
Bold move to confess that to someone when you are giving up your last defense: sight anonymity
I’m like the wind on a windy day, I blend into the crowd but you may feel like you can identify me
Damn if only I knew where to get a picture of you......
Oh
i just said i wasn't inside tyler lmao
the dog takes pee pee breaks at 9PM
for petting a dog outside the building yesterday and waving at zack who didn't even look at me 😭
fat coc*
Why am I still awake? 🤡
if only this rain was snow :(
It stopped
Are you on campus? From Hitchcock view, I don't see any rain
omg it did
Huh I guess I didn’t remember
sorry nevermind
FUCK
FUCK FUCK
i havent even read chapter 0
Also, I thought I heard someone say that the physics class doesn't use a textbook
we dont have a textbook, but we do have reading assign
Yeah you're right it isn't really a textbook
Oh
but i dont think anyone reads
Um I think I am having internet problems lol
Bruh it won't connect to vc
Bruh I just realized we get a formula sheet for physics exam?
i dont believe you
You don't get a formula sheet. You just write the equations on a two sheets of paper and add on to it as you take more exams
We don’t even have that many formulas tho
My hand actually hurts if I extend it too much
damn LOL
i suck at it
I'm expecting to hear that you got a 95 in the class several months from now
what kinda physics shit this hw on?
don't remind me ://
Yeah same I’m almost done but still really scared that I didn’t memorize anything I wrote out
can't believe I'd say this but I really miss Jim
what if we did that 2 weeks ago
cuz it's once per month
i wish :nkolostcrittycry:
I can't imagine being a pre-med and having my future depend on how toughly one of my biology professors graded. I would feel so anxious
UCM, work energy
@chandachan @absence000 the exam has 19 questions and 50 minutes time limit
Wtf
I'm guessing since there's a strict time-limit, we won't have to scan and upload answers then
I'm late but it's once per calendar month so still gotta re-enter
Ansh I'm hoping it's like CHEM 111 where it's conceptual questions containing multiple choice because otherwise
‘Typing speed can help a bit’ LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL ALL THE CHEM 105/106/111 PEEPS ARE LAUGHING SO HARD RN *wheeze*
Someone who took engr 145 last semester told me that his exams were open note😐
Fk the open note. You won't even get time to read your notes
His exams are still open note at least that's good
I just asked him. He said we don't need to type any equations
He still wants our cameras to be on
But like if you’re not even in a classroom is it even closed book
How is it already almost 2 pm on the day before an exam
time needs to slow down
Eh I'm bored
I'm bored. Imma die
Hi bored, would you like to do my phys hw
Hate it
got my math exam score  🥲
rainy, if thats what ur into, then i guess im happy
@jundragon99 what if we broke covid protocols together.....haha...jkjk.....unless?
omg
@kaori_flute you must be into this weeb shit
eyo wtf
nah bro u cant just delete that
i just did tho
I probably still wont
I have to have due diligence on my work :nkosip:
@_the_intern_ im sorry for asking whether i can milk you. that was wrong of me.
WEL U CANT DO UR JOB
winston pls explain. im hungry
okay i wont take ur job lmao
I used to be PR back in high school club tho :nkosip:
jenin can you send me some halal food. im hungry
oh lala
Oh my goodness gracious
@zacharious Can you help me with a homework question quickly
Why can’t we have an emote king role
Ok I should really get off discord so that Haywood doesn’t kill me
idk
OKAY BACK TO WORK
Do you mind hopping in study channel
Anyone wants to challenge the TT maestro
Oh, table tennis
I invited people also. Now, I'm back in dorm. It was so boring
why was it boring?
Coz I can only bounce the ball on the racket which got lame after 100 consequtive bounces so I'm like let's do service then smash and leave
i dont think she has even started
it took Nobel and I like 4-5 hours to finish it
i dont think it'll take that much time tho
You didn't tell me this
@toomanyzs i dont want pics of cleveland. i want your pics UwU
@zackt7718 @toomanyzs @zacharious we want your pics
I do be like this: Sages, Sages go away. Come again another day
iPhone🥰
some pictures from a hike last week
Damn
And he never brushed his tee-we-eetg
I can only do that if I have plan with friends. Can't go alone
But I can easily do that alone
Why can't you do it alone?
You feel lonely. Like 1-2 hours alone maybe but can't go beyond that
That's a lengthy walk. Like 50 min or so. I find the walk from Hitchcock to Strosacker and back tiring at times so I would stop at Tinke or KSL and spend rest of the day there. Also, I can't walk while listening to music coz it's scary if I run into an accident or so.
slacking was fun though :uwu: 
ok will work i promise
😀 nope
but only in rough tho. i have to write it again for submission
Aren’t you in physics as well
idk if youre being serious rn but watch wednesday's lecture
we literally have gone over it the last two classes
work it, work it
I’m not in phys 121 and even I know y’all learned work smh
I never claimed i was smart
work lol
you don’t have to be smart to know what’s going on
Pri's name doesn't even phonetically make sense
Oh whale
Makes sense why I can’t function properly
OH NO, I GOTTA A DISEASE
I’m leaving
nope
Unfortunately
Don't have an Insta because I can't upload wide shots
Why am I still here I HAVE AN EXAM TO STUDY FOR
rip
it doesn't handle albums or story well
Rip
Can't compare those
I have **THREE** exams this week to prepare for
two math ones ig
Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Public Finance
public finance is that upper level econ class correct?
Comp major tho right
next sem imma have 3/4 math classes 🤡
Honestly, the easiest math class is still harder than most other classes
Discrete Math is the easiest one imo
Also, my Linear Algebra professor made the exam available through Lockdown browser for two days so this way we can have 3 lectures and a test in one week
That's a lot of work.
Professors don't care much about exams. They still need to continue with their portions
It is, I have to spend 10-15 hours a week on this class
Need to catch up on SAGES tho. USem is harder than the previous sem
I spent like 1.5 hours on Friday alone just reviewing notes/homework to do the linear algebra quiz and I think I would have failed it if I didn't do that
David man my bio exam is tomorrow and I’m not even halfway through reviewing my second-to-last lecture
These exams this week are going to kill my GPA
Well there's only 2 questions on the linear algebra quiz and I got one of them only because I carefully reviewed homework again so I just barely avoided failing it
Not bad still
That's bordering on C which I would say is bad
79/100 and below is a C so getting an 8/10 on a quiz is too close to a C for my liking
The brutal reality though is that the top grad schools will want to see a 3.8+ GPA
Most med schools want that gpa at all levels🤡
oh damn
People here study a lot
They also look at MCAT score and extra-curriculars (clinical shadowing hours + non clinical work)
time to get top 10% while double majoring in EE and math
this will involve getting at most 3 Bs, tho ngl idgaf about grades aside from it being a measure of how well I understand shit
Ngl everyday I question why I declared my double major and minor. I still don’t know if I’ll be able to handle the workload
the shit im finna pull is HARDCORE MODE lmao
it aint for the faint of heart or mind
Why tf am I tired already?
Seems difficult to do that in 4 years even with a decent amount of AP credit
Yh, I have IB credit for math, chem, and Bio. Bio's some transfer course or so which is useless but that's the only reason I'm able to pull this off
So that means that you came in with credit for CHEM 111 and MATH 121?
@kaori_flute r u done with physics yet :eyes2:
I don’t think so
i don't wanna say UwU
I dont think he is
Dhananjay I think Winston needs a hug. Pls go to his room and give him a tight hug
Let me go to cutter and hug you
I'm only one call away
Damn
I have math homework due tomorrow morning that I'm struggling to do... I'm screwed
Damn
Start your work earlier
David we really want you to try the all-nighter experience
I've done all-nighters and I felt like crap afterwards
I dont think he procrastinates
It’s 9am and I haven’t slept
Damn
damn
I don't consider 3am an allnighter
Because I still get 6 hours of sleep
Not enough for me tho
The latest I've stayed up this semester was until 3 AM for Discrete Math homework
rip man
It is easy, I was just a 🤡 and forgot to check my work until right before it was due
I probably won't say it's easy after this exam though
Damn @ansh8867 youre in my Calc 3 class
Yeah idk
Cause he's stay at home and in my calc 3
At least Raunak fell for it
Yes I fell for it. I legit thought you’re the price of Persia
We're so lame
Someone please ping
Someone do coding ping
oh shit
wtf is happening
Imma need chemotherapy after this
I'm dying rn
I can't believe how many people just rolled with this
what did I miss
Im totally ready for that exam
ENGR !$% EXAM
@sprinkles2108 Your ready for the exam?
@_frostyyyyy_ you should go to sleep
Studies show that all nighters are bad
3 hours from now
Sup, @_frostyyyyy_ you pissed or smth
It's still only 9:13 AM in my area
Having math homework assigned over the weekend and due on Monday morning so I can't talk to the professor or TAs about it is not fun
Having ~~math~~ homework assigned ~~over the weekend~~ and due ~~on Monday morning so I can't talk to the professor or TAs about it~~ is not fun
~~Having math homework assigned over the weekend and due on Monday morning so I can't talk to the professor or TAs about it is ~~not fun
~~Having math homework assigned over the weekend and due on Monday morning so I can't talk to the professor or TAs about it is not fun~~
Do your physics homework
jenin, this hw sucks
werent you on 2 like 6 hours back?
the problems are super long
Thats bs man, shouldn't be allowed
I studied a lot today and I still don't think I got a hang of this
I don't feel prepared in any way for my exams this week 🤡
One of my TAs told me that it seemed like I was very well prepared for an exam and I was internally thinking "I have no clue what's going on in this class"
What class is it
I feel most prepared for Discrete Math right now
Oh really?
What about the math?
The math is just some simple calculus
Oh icic
There's also utility functions though
Like partial derivatives nd shit
No, ECON 309 is the only econ class that uses Calculus 3 (Intermediate Micro)
Damn whatt
Would I need 103 concepts tho
Like inflation and shit like that @_frostyyyyy_
Nope
Damn
Damn so I could basically speedrun micro
oh
i have 6. need another 6
I just like it because it's a social science/humanities class in which I don't have to write essays
Cause the math seems fun
I need that
I think I'll need to do algo first tho
That class sounds hard
And I can also take MATH 382 (Probability in higher dimensions) if i want
Since that counts towards the track
Its not even a 400 level class
I can't sleep because I still have a math problem due tomorrow morning that I don't understand
I’m gonna study until 1 at most and call it a night
I am so screwed in this class
Nope
I thought you were in 214 last semester
Imma cry
Coudnt take it cause I didnt take chem last sem
I have a rough draft of a scientific paper due tomorrow at 10 and I'm just now starting on it
Is this for a polymer class?
David which class are you crying over?
MATH 307: Linear Algebra
I know it's pathetic but this homework problem is taking me a long time
Oh boy if you’re struggling then imma fail
especially with upper level math
Problem is that it's due in 9 hours and I would like to get some sleep
I might be 1000 miles away from Houston, but I'll come to you if you need me
Aw
@chandachan do you need a hug?
Hug 🫂
What's with all of the emergencies lately?
warmer weather
I don't see anything sus out of my window
I do hear sirens tho
A helicopter just went overhead
Oh, that's better. I was worried it was because of crime
Just breaking up the traffic on euclid
Emergency ended, all clear
My mom heard about the shooter on campus and was like this is why I don’t want you to go
Hate to break it to you
3rd time in 2 weeks
Anything can happen
Damn what happened this time?
Someone heard gunshots
Not on campus though
Abdul stay safe brother. I don’t wanna lose you
My mother just doesn’t want me to leave her until I’m in my 20’s I guess🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Do you study in thwing right inside the door, and at the table outside of jolly
ah no, haven't studying in thwing by the door in a long time
its a very old picture of me taking a chinese placement exam
I hate this EMAC class
We really are writing a review article over shit we know literally nothing about
but this review article is stupid
like the papers I have to read for the paper I don't even know what the fuck they're talking about
Yo my bed feels extra comfy tonight idk what it is but I can feel a good night's sleep tonight
Im gonna be real, I have no problem with the beds here. I've never been uncomfortable on them.
son like what the fuck does this even mean
overbearing parents basically cut the coccoon for the butterfly instead of allowing it to exert itself and break outta its coccoon
The two lowest homework assignments get dropped so I might have to use one of those on this
I really don't
It's hard to do a question when there isn't any other question like it in the book and the professor wrote it so I have no idea how to find other resources on how to solve it
cuz the 1st problem looks just like a comparison of norms lmfao
i don't see how the default inner product can be used to prove the statement given in that problem, but i used those norms, and was able to prove it directly
She specifically designed the problems because we weren't able to talk much about norms
@_frostyyyyy_ can’t you ask someone in the class for help?
even if linear algebra norms aren't in ur vocab
the discrim was 0 so its >= 0 since its concave up
On another note however, if you're not done with physics homework you need to finish it because it's longer than expected
That reminds me, I need to turn that thing in, it's due at 5pm and I still haven't scanned it lol
I'm done studying for my exam, I'm going to take a 1 hour break 🙂
8ball says I'm getting a 98
Exam over!!!
I’m done studying too🤡
Imma cry
Damn Physics was empty today
youch, why are there so many exams rn. yalls classes need to chill tf out
Yeah I didn't want Monday because I had a bio exam 😦
Your classes don't have exams right now?
I have like 3 exams this week
Yeah I did and I didn’t do too awfully bad
hold up the answer key is wrong with one of the questions
Bruh we still have a MasteringBiology?
In CHEM 111, the answer key was wrong half the time. There was one question where the answer key was wrong and the correction was also wrong
I got 7/8 points even though my answer was completely different from both of them
Class was wack
Don't people specialize after med school during residency? I may be getting it wrong though since I'm not a pre-med
i thought mdphd was for biotech development and stuff but i hate flashcards so there's no way I'm ever going to med school
yeah memorization is a pain
Bro I wanted to be a vet for all of middle school
One of the most prominent computer scientists in the world says "We should stop training radiologists now"
I wanted to be a physicist until I learned to code and was like oh damn this shit is dope
Physicists still need to code but not as much
well not yet bc they don't let freshman or sophmores intern but yes eventually
oh yup, I feel that. it's very hard for frosh to get internships
I'm a freshman and I'm applying for research jobs now because I didn't get an internship
Don't you want to go to grad school tho?
i never got an email from them
I don't know what the pay (if any) is yet but I applied anyway
yeah i haven't decalred yet which is prolly why i didn't get it
I can’t apply to majority of the internship positions cause I’m international 🤡
Life is sad
Prolly go back but idk
@_frostyyyyy_ @djsurti and @chandachan Guys, do you want to be in a team for Leo schneider math competition
Answer this first. leave rain
@ansh8867 Ngl, the questions from the competition last year look difficult
But on a serious note, my dad wants me to go to an Indian graduate school
They have a grad school right?
Raunak go to Stanford omg
Ah rip
Getting in Stanford for grad school is nearly impossible
There aren't arranged marriages in India anymore?
I mean there are matrimony websites (shaadi.com), the parents meeting happened over zoom lol
I checked. I don't have an exam on March 27th, when the competition takes place
Well, the 27th is on Saturday, so I would hope that no one has any exams on that day
To the left
fuck u loser
10900 Euclid Ave Cleveland, OH 44106
I'm tired
Hi tired, im working on phys
Haven't had coffee in ages. Probably get one from Starbucks
2 weeks without coffee. Imma die
Cold coffee
We will be sad when Alberto graduates 😔
if i want caffeine which is nvr cuz it make u dumb
He said he wants a new car
@_the_intern_ what kind of car would you like?
oh, and it needs to have a rearview camera
jenin u cant just simp like that
This is unimaginable to me... I probably haven't gone that long without coffee for several years
I forgot david takes caffeine pills
Who wants to leave their position then lol?
I've been out of my dorm since 12:45 pm. Imma go back now
did u kill dhananjay?
Y’all left Dhananjay out smh
For a math competition
Nothing is written in stone
It's so cold rn. I'm hearing a hoodie and suffering. Sudden breeze 🥶
@djsurti I saw you at Tinke but you didn't wave back.
me when i drink my super cold milkshake at tink thats killing my hands :slurpmagik:
and its still frozen??
how cold do u run
smh the downside of being from the cold
I legit made snow angels without gloves when there was a foot of snow. Didn't get frostbite
*he doesnt knoooowww*
Damn
Oh shit Im sorry dude
Omg how could I be so wrong
Lol the last time I was in a math competition was middle school lolllllllllll
How does taking standard math classes that many CS/engineering majors take make us gods?
David and Zach are math goddesses
Based on my performance in MATH 307, it might be generous to call me a "math god"
The professor in linear algebra even said "Since this is a 300-level class, you are expected to learn some things yourself"
When the only 300-level class I’m in is health psych🤠
no need to rush
That’s still a 200-level class though😭😭
idk what i even signed up for
is it like a math modeling competition?
I wasn't the one who announced it
Oh
Problems from 2019: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5pudvayO5wLlaoLC4VZKnrs9reY5q32/view
Did you sign up tho?
oh not what i was expecting
I haven't taken up to discrete or linear lol
Zhanda you have Ansh tho
Not yet
You guys don't have to take differential equations but instead take linear algebra
CS math reqs: Calc 1-3, stats or probability, discrete, linear algebra
Discrete is not there in the thing tho
it's cross listed as a CSDS course which might be why you didn't notice it
ok so this competition is just calculus problems with some other topics
I didn’t get any email
Coz ur not in the math club
It was due 3 hours back
dydrate to the last drop
And logical problems
@_frostyyyyy_ I saw that you signed up your team for the math competition. I realized I forgot to put on the form the slot for the team name. It is now updated on the form, so when you have the chance please fill in that slot. You can also just send your team name to me and I will fill it for you. 

In the past, we have used math related teams such as Proof by Failure to Find a Counterexample. Feel free to take time thinking of a team name with your team members. 

Hope you have a good week,
3 hours after the due date
this one is kinda cringe tho
did u still wanna compare answers
Oh My Cosh
shame that we cant use it
English ugh
priyanka out here with math puns
Girls be failing math and be like omg I’m so pale. Girl, you’re focusing on the wrong tan
I’m leaving
then you must be the manliest man with that 105% in math
Stop spreading misinformation about math. There are already too many slippery slopes around here
I think, I need.................... help
idk what server you're on
jenin ima be honest i dont have that
Everyone please don’t be a 3rd derivative
Math puns
That's a physics joke if you want to make it force*distance
I’ll do as much math as I need to. I’ll even take Math 307 with @_frostyyyyy_. But graphing is where I’ll draw the line
You have to specify third derivative of position with respect to time. Can't just say it like that
My smol brain didn’t get it
oh 🤡
i dont understand this new chem lab
Why couldn’t y’all tell that math puns was the first sin of my craziness?
Hmmmm why can’t I remember that lab smh
Stupid sig figs. You follow the rules also but still screwed
I don’t even know where all my chem lab reports went FAT RIP
Mom come pick me up I’m scared
ngl this is not as bad as the christmas one
Fair
It's not a req for engineers. I don't see it in general education reqs. Last class is differential eqns
I just learned in Discrete Math that if 0 = 1, then 1 = 2 is a valid statement
leave the man alone
is it bad that I don't know what zbt is
is it bad that I don't know what cbt is
Franklin left
Damn
Is he salty that people don’t like his frat
PSA: don't raid organizations, especially if they're from your own school.
damn
damn that's tough
How did you manage to ping someone who isn't in the server anymore?
its cuz discord doesnt register a user as left until a short bit after their leave
zhanda caught the tail end of it
since he's not in the server I feel comfortable pinging him
Huh didn’t work
Oh
Oh
oh 😐
you might need to have developer options enabled
We miss him 🥺
yuh he went to my school
And I intentionally don't have snacks around
The object is to not leave my room because I have all my good sleep vibes in the room
I'm just saying, @chandachan everyone you ping is leaving the server, I think you should stop 😂
Oh yeah I just saw joyous leave
ye, unless you want to b the next person to leave, i'd recommend you stop
@nobelium19 @howdy_. Yeah, I realized that my pinging was straddling the line between self-entertainment and harassment, and it kind of crossed the line to the latter so I will stop this kind of behavior from now on
I fucking laughed
Oh noooo what a loss
i'm gonna miss him 🥺
I thought you were like Britta from Community so just wanted to see
I’ve never watched Community so
Isn't Annie. I'm retarded
I've never seen Community
I got up at 11:36 am today. I was busy watching Indian Idol yesterday. I need to get my sleep schedule fixed but 10 hours sleep is abnormal
I still felt sleepy for a while today even after getting 8 hours of sleep... 💀
I only slept for 5 hours
I don't feel like doing anything if I only get 5 hours
I had a math quiz for which I needed to study
That’s why I woke up a bit early
I've only had a couple days this semester where I've gotten 5 hours of sleep and it was when I had a lot of work to do
I’m trying to have as normal of a sleep schedule as possible
So far I’m not sleeping well only around exam time
Don’t use that word please @ansh8867
It doesn't insult anyone
Special kind of stupid? :thonk:
Yh so that's why I stopped using it
Doesnt “dumb” mean you can’t speak?
doesn't add anything of value to my life
Me neither unless they insult someone for something they can’t control
lol fair
I thought dumb meant you can’t speak but I may be wrong
@ansh8867 don’t you wanna be a doctor too lol
don't need an eye doctor when I could just make a robot to see for me ✨
ew discord phone users
there's 3 fields of study in which u get the most outta ur money
Physics, Engineering, and Math
Medicine gives a shit ton
I'm not doing it for the money
But I don't like that the extra-sensitivity disturbs general conversations
Learning never stops. There are trained doctors who still learn till this date in their 50's, 60's also. Life-long learning remains in every field. It just depends on your attitude to stay a student or be a sassy teacher. Always remain a student
Why make money when you can simply pass away
A math, physics, or engineering bachelor's degree is more lucrative than almost any other bachelor's degree, but the top doctors make unimaginable amounts of money
I thought his dad was a PhD
Oh
My dad got a PhD from an EECS department
Math/physics can damage your GPA if you're not careful and then that can kill the chance to go to a top med/law school
Oh then give me the money you earn
this shit SLAPS lmfaoooooo
Grading may be tougher but there's a lot more extracurricular/research opportunities that can help you get into med school
Covid has limited that though
Or maybe cause they didn’t apply. Are you sure GPA is the main reason?
I could’ve taken the easy way out and just majored in neuroscience but I have too many interests also I need to prepare for the rigors of med school
im not even applying med school so i got nothing to lose
No it’s because of gpa many pre meds and pre laws don’t pursue an engineering major
75th percentile for Yale Law is 3.99 GPA so if you get one B in college, your chances of getting in are significantly lowered
Doesn't your dad work at the cleveland clinic Clement
Wtf
People major in English and history and go to Harvard medical school
If you want to get into a med school/law school, GPA is paramount
different topic: i wish leutner makes mac n cheese more often. It's really good
If you want to get into a top med school then you need a 3.9+ GPA and a 99th percentile MCAT ideally
But then I quit because I realized that I have little interest in biology/chemistry
nothing to lose
why study chemistry when you can study physics
read this interesting study last year
I also reasoned that I wouldn't know what I would want to do if I didn't get into med school
@_frostyyyyy_ @halcyon6561 “AAMC statistics that break down how well people with various undergraduate concentrations perform on the MCAT reveal that the college majors correlated with the highest MCAT scores are those in mathematics and statistics disciplines. The mean MCAT score among math and statistics majors who applied to medical school is 510.5, which equals or exceeds the scores of 80% to 83% of test-takers, according to the AAMC's official MCAT percentile chart.” US News
but when the mice were rescued right before they went under, dried off, and put back in the water, guess how long they stayed afloat for?
Why? Isn't biology the quintessential pre-med major?
It is but... idk how to explain it
Now guess how long those mice were able to tread water after being rescued
Us neuro majors have to take stat 312 and a programming class oh my goodness guys I’m gonna get a 528 on the mcat
EE and Math
Cold
don’t use Mayo
They were able to go for 60 hours
All cuz they were waiting for someone to rescue em
Are you sure they were actually treading or were they dead and were just floating in the water
For nearly half a millennia humanities was the backbone of universities
Engineering is an actual solid field of study. I can't say the same about the humanities cuz half of their research is bullshit that can't be replicated
No wonder why most of that is never cited again
How do u know if you’re cut out for engineering
I have a fear of maths and physics
Please don’t
Math and phys is the backbone of engr
my father wanted me to go into med 🤡  but we kinda convinced him in CS
but i don't wanna do medicine
i don't think it suits me at all
Main point is, the mice were able to tread water for a *lot longer* when they believed that someone was gonna rescue them
Still not sure how to apply this to my life though
i _think_ I’ll be able to double major music with something STEM but I don’t know what tho
i don't think i would want to be taking chemistry classes rn
Tbh I don’t know why Nobel is killing himself with a major in bio lol I think CS alone is fine unlessssssss he really likes bio
also medical school looks scary
Well I don’t wanna take physics rn
I'm still considering EE/CE but I read that so many EE majors go into software development anyway
@kaori_flute is double majoring in CS hard
with school, since im not applying to med school, i have nothing to lose when it comes to taking hard shit
mmmm
i would say that majoring in CS alone is very time-consuming
software development is some serious shit
You haven’t declared your major yet right?
It's really tough to get hired at a prestigious tech company for software development though
Idk man
i mean idk much tbh cuz i hardly have any experience in it
but you can spend hours working on a bug
or figuring out more efficient code
Yeah I’m not actually interested in CS I’m just trying to get a frame of reference
I thought I’m already taking it for you?
i just wanna go HARDCORE MODE in school cuz i can
I'm a CS major but I'm early enough that I could switch into some types of engineering and graduate on time
Cuz I want to explore what direction in STEM I want to go in
I still feel like a clown for declaring my degrees so early on🤡
David don’t leave CS :sadcat:
at cwru people delcare way earlier than they need to
But y tho
but u dont need to until sophomore year
There's even less of a need to declare here because there's no restrictions on majors like many schools have
At many schools, if you get a bad GPA, you get kicked out of engineering
I hope neuro, psych, and public health won’t be too much
This reminds me that I need to declare soon
seems about right, i declared myself as EE and Math at the end of last fall
i guess i should yeet myself UwU
I declared end of last semester too but I’m a freshman🤡
I want you to take “eat shit Zack” to a different level
At Texas A&M, you need to get a 3.5 GPA to guarantee entry to your preferred major
It's the biggest school in the country I think
What is bad about ASU?
ASU is a solid school from what I've seen
University of Arizona keeps sending me emails asking me to transfer there
~~still big numbers~~
That includes all campuses which shouldn't count
can't forget this one
idk
I know, I was pointing out that counting all ASU campuses doesn't count
I decided not to do pre-med because I realized that it isn't what I'm good at
Isn't it a meme that pre-meds just stare at their flashcards for like 3 hours a day and that it gets even worse in med school?
Right cuz of all the memorisation
Idk but we have hard classes because you need to be able to think critically as a doctor
Case's med school was one of the exemplars elevated in the Flexner Report
I just read up on all sorts of shit lmfao
I thought I'm good at things like math but I don't know how much further I can go before I hit a wall
I'm only at linear algebra and my grades aren't that much higher than the class average
So I'm worried that if I try to go further then I'll just be average in higher classes
That's the last thing I would be concerned about
Jeff Bezos said he switched out of theoretical physics because he realized that many of his classmates at Princeton were better than him at it
I do want to take more math classes, but I'm worried that in classes like abstract algebra or analysis that I would not stand out
and dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths, its all propaganda
@_frostyyyyy_ You've got the wrong priorities. Standing out comes from understanding, so focus on understanding first instead of ur rankings
Bruh my performance? I haven't done anything yet
~~i don't want to do premed though~~
can't manage even music
Should I double major in CS and math?
And on top of not being Nobel I don’t know if he can manage Music+Premed
I broke a piano key once
oh my
If I could uberload 50 credits per sem, I would be goin ham on physics courses along with EE and math
Oh lala?
i got 3 complaints in 2 weeks this semester 🤡
I can sustain _fff_ and _ppp_ but crescendos and diminuendo are kinda hard
never
I have some work to do on that
Don't make me homesick rn
They'll be scared of us Zhanda 😆
I've scared many people in India by just walking. They lose their shit when they turn back
it is possible for prions to become a mass scale public health hazard cuz of mad cow disease
dont want that shit gettin into the food or water supply
my mom can't donate blood because she was in London when mad cow disease struck there
god damn
Damn
nope just a US citizen
Mom came back from there to birth my younger sister, and she was held in quarantine initially cuz she came from toronto
until last year
it was horrible when that shit hit, the mortality was a lot higher than this coronavirus
tho it wasnt as infectious
how long did it last?
have i told yall why i only went to preschool for 6 months?
wow so babies these days will be like me when they grow up: they wont know that covid happened just like how i didnt know that sars happened
damn
cuz you were too smart
and im not even catholic
cuz zooms literally chinese spyware
cuz i generally dont take things personally
I didn't know it was possible to join Zoom lectures without signing in with your CWRU account
just dont sign in
Guess who was a dummy and spilled coffee on their laptop and iPad 🤡
@stuckinohiolads Don't think I didn't see that
could be worse
fax i turned my laptop upside down immediately
Shit
He can eat my ass because I wrote him a bad review anyways
i only rated my math prof from last semester
I didnt rate anyone
couldn't find the time to review bader and drew
I dont rate people
damn
this is the same guy down in georgia who got me into math again lmfao
Math again? elaborate
I haven't written any reviews for RMP last semester yet
I keep telling myself to do them but I procrastinate doing them with homework 🤡
nahh they just suspect we will end up with vaccines by then
I mean cases per week for students have stayed at a static 14-15 for the past three weeks so its not like we are doing that grrat
Which means they 100% won’t be but
What do you mean don’t you want to have family meals together in leutner?
There are so many stations that aren't there that I iss
miss
yeah lol i recently realized that i havent gotten sick a single time since covid started
As it turns out, masks, social distancing, and handwashing also help fight the flu
normally i get a bad cold like once or twice a year
but i havent in like a year and a half now
4. The precaution that is dismissed but also is extremely helpful is not touching your eyes. If you're wearing a mask, you can't touch your nose or mouth, but eyes are a vector for transmission, and even if you sit at a desk where a dude had covid and yacked all over, by not touching your mucus membranes your risk of transmission is drastically lowered
aren't most cases here transmitted by people going into each other's dorm rooms tho?
I can’t read so this doesn’t mean anything to me
do you think that it's still 90%?
Considering that I've encountered gatherings of 8 and 9 in a room, I think that it is far more common than you think
damn
yeah, so it would show that surface transmission is still important, but nowhere near as bad as unmasked groups?
This is off-topic, but give david the chill role now that Franklin is gone
what happened to franklin
I don't know
wtf i just went on my phone to order food to pickup but apparently i already did that and just forgot about it and its ready now ????
leutner closed at 8 💀
zach is still going on
people get mad at me for calling zhanda an idiot but not for being anti-british
To be perfectly honest, I haven't heard of a single case from somebody being in class with somebody else, or sitting at a covid-y desk being a source of infection. I *have* heard plenty regarding people in groups, and especially couples, because in my experience, the willingness to break the rule for another person multiplies when there is that relationship bond. Let's say Person A is dating Person B, and they sleep over with one another, etc. Person A doesn't feel comfortable with gathering with more than Person B, but Person B is a little more adventurous, and hangs out in Groups of 2-3 routinely, with the occasional 5+. There are two possible outcomes here:
1. Person A sticks to their guns and doesn't gather with more than just person B, but person B's exposure is so consistent and intimate with Person A that Person A is basically sharing all the germs of Person B. This is still bad, but is the lower risk of the two outcomes. 
2. Person A is pressured by Person B to branch out a little, and ends up occasionally gathering in 3-5+, emboldening Person B to do so more often, and Person A's infection risk skyrockets.
3. Person A is completely safe, but gets sick from community transmission (the gym, classmate, etc) but is Asymptomatic, and even though they only are in close proximity with Person B, Person B's habits cause Person A's otherwise manageable and contained infection to proliferate
This doesn't have to be a romantic/sexual relationship either; any consistent, precaution-less/reduced interaction can fit these situations
lets be honest, deep down we're jealous of the people who actually have someone intimate theyre willing to break the covid rules with 😳
Finn that requires commitment to a relationship why tf would i want that
Adam so you’re saying you don’t want a relationship?
damn ok i guess you guys are all rocking the single life then huh
sorry
One of my best friends is engaged and they get an AirBnB to avoid spread to his suitemates and to respect the guidelines. He doesn't have any other significant, precautionless exposures and neither does she. Furthermore, he is vaccinated.
oh ripppp
hah, i dont need that. so far, I do a good enough job ruining them on my own 😎
what the fuck?
idk if cbus is more or less expensive than cle tho
oh damn thats actually really cheap
they want stonks
idk
they want to steal ur monies
doesn't matter if college is one of the best personal investments you can make!
Markets drive down prices; the problem is specifically that CWRU doesn't allow you to use the housing market as an underclassman
You have selection bias because of the safety alerts bringing up the incidents that are serious whenever they happen.
Here's an example; your beloved columbus has had 2 safety alerts in the past 24 hours alone
if it hit u in the head
no i didn't
It is safer but it's still more dangerous than most places
tho i live in a suburb of it so im never near actual cbus
@sprinkles2108 What's the context for your status? "Just saved my laptop from death"
oh shit
but this laptop is going to my dad
gosh i hate being clumsy
coulda lost my ipad too but thankfully only the lock button is slightlyyyyyyyyy sticky, which i dont use anyway
simply dont have liquids near ur pc
pro tip: if you ever spill something on your laptop, turn it upside down IMMEDIATELY
liquid doesn't do shit unless there is current
i didn't do that oopsies
mhm i still need to figure out how to clean the plug box on my desk 
so that the person that comes next semester won't scorch to death bcz of me
i actually made a joke to my mom that i ran the laptop through the dishwasher today
And my dad is an attending at a hospital
i want an iPad and airpods pls ty
oh and a new phone
Clement, pay my college tuition
Clement do you need my SIS account information?
@djsurti there's a rly nice fur coat that my gf wants, get that for her and i'll hook u up with a lifetime premium subscription
You asked me for what I wanted right?
who is the devil though?
Boo
get yourself taken care of at 🅱️leveland 🅱️linic
Damn those are some good gifs/emojis Clement
ochem would actually be sick to learn lmfao
as of now i don't plan on taking summer classes
im not taking summer classes. ideally i'd like to do research IF MY DUMB SELF WOULD EMAIL PROFS OMG
having shit open in person would help with labs, cuz i'd prefer doing those in person
oh
What are you too scared to get a reply back?
no im just busy and stupid
Oh
Stop being stupid bro
i need to find the time to send emails
and i haven't made time
part of planning is "i need to do this shit *by this particular time*"
i just want to do something productive this summer
idk if summer classes are worth the extra money
Nd then you don't even read the paper
Profs est that shit up
yeppppppppp i already cold-emailed bme profs last semester so i'll use a similar format
@_the_intern_ I know it's your birthday on Saturday, so if you need to celebrate it with your family or friends, do not feel obliged to come to the orchid show
Fuck that ppl do all the time
second of all, i aint in amsa or in phide
Damn how do you know pris CV offhand
Totally don't have 12 of those in my building alone
Idk, I suggest the good ol tactic of fuk around and find out
FR OMG LOLLLLLLLLLLL
Ah shit im kinda busy then
Its okay tho
Biochem= boring
and the other chem bio major who is from my hs is Shweta idk if you know her
The fact that I knew what I was getting into so I was well prepared bc I had previously tried it before leaving case
tho
i dont count chem as a minor lol
Damn
this junior at cwru who went to hs w me
ye, what do u need to describe in those docs?
For those wondering, Chemical biology is more drug development and small molecules (Chemistry applied to biology) and biochemistry is studying the chemistry *of* biology.
Not even counting the dozens of tables you need
Needs to be quite comprehensive ic
i could NEVER major in chem bio oml
I like complex shit
IDK y
Don't cook meth
I hope you don't because that's reflux, not distillation
Breaking bad vibes
My professor for that class has the breaking bad meth truck as his background on zoom
Have you ever gotten stuck at a CS problem and solved it?
Damn, what's this class?
That alone should convince you that its fun
Fair
Omg
During activity fair
yea same math>>>>>> programming
ok we get it your life is sad
Damn, I wished they covered that up in OChem.
Go to sleep
if you don't want to go into programming because your parents make it look boring, that's an issue with parents, not programming.
I don't remember
@toomanyzs ive never taken an ochem class before. should i take chem 223 or 323
Is that society encourages bad tooling and we're stuck using ass from the 70s that makes everything needlessly harder
My dad makes it look really fun but I don't have a programming brain as such. I did do CSDS 132 tho
Kotlin bad execution at an attempt to make clojure
fair
sad
Worse than JS in terms of lang design
No, I want to be a doctor, I'm just a chemical Biology major which is a fancy term for Chemistry major who is premed but doesn't want to not get something out of all the bio i have to take
Python prolly close to #1
C doesn't have type safety and that sucks
Which is #1 for optimization work
I started studying for it in December but Covid screwed up the test date availability so I postponed to summer
Granted tho that's a p niche skillset to need
no it's arduino C, you don't have a lot of options cause you gotta use the IDE to upload the code
the libraries we need are for C
323 is not a req tho
My approach to pre-med is to do whatever I want to do in order to make me a well-rounded and fulfilled person, which will make me a stronger person in the care of my patients because I won't be an empty husk who was funneled down the academia train into dermatology. Ex read my meme about "I am a freshman pre-med bio major etc"
Just a pain in the ass if
for example, i didn't rush phi d e cuz idkkkkkkkk
and i didnt join amsa cuz idk what i would get out of it
Solid approach. What's up with dermatology tho?
Those people can absolutely be successful but it's not for me. I tried to be that person and I was very unsuccessful. I prefer my way
everyone goes for that since it's an "easier" specialty
really ?
and amsa doesnt seem like it?
I never knew that, what makes it easier?
I'm scared for after school
What if everything is boring and miserable
SSSSSHHHHHHHHHMONEY and because they work 9-4, 4 days a week, nobody needs one in an ER or OR, and tbh any ER doc or family med can do any procedure they perform.
Many BME's end up skipping pre-med and just go into industry. I get these thoughts some tiems
hence why i want to do what i LIKE in college and not just resume builder stuff
I heard it's hard to make the jump into the industry with just a BSE
Lol schools boring too tho
i hate the idea of doing shit just for them to look good on my record
School is kill jpy
I j wanna work on my maths papers
Doing good shit builds your confidence
That's why I chose to major in EE and math instead of BME
That way I'm able to build and design more types of shit
Major. Math and CS
bruh I shouldn't have pinged him
My major is a deans approved tht has no math
I just like writing math
I do work mostly in foundations
i only have one more math class to take😎
got credit for Math 121 and 122, tho i decided to take 126 last semester. then all i have left is stat 312
And semantics of maths
Nope
Gödels incompleteness theorem marks the end of math syntax
Philosophy of maths
What I'm working on right now is
A naturalistic definition of information and proving probability as a corollary of that math  and the EPI principle
@kaori_flute go to sleep
i wish i could go sleep 🥲
Not just correlations between two maths
oh, what would a semantic meaning provide?
Although he prolly didn't know it at the time
If I say there's probability .5 of getting a heads from a fair coin
I know probability as an abstraction for the proportions of all the possible outcomes of a situation, given u marked a "save state" in the world, and ran that save state of reality over and over again
But that breaks down if you're only given 1 toss doesn't it?
What does it mean to have probability .5 for something that can only ever happen once?
You're assuming you can simulate hwoever many times tho
In this scenario you can't
at throwing a coin you get 0.5 as probability for head and tails
There's many many philosophical definitions
IFF but you want the most robust idea possible, to apply in every situation in which you can speak of probability
Well, a coin may not necessarily be fair
Probability and expectation won't tell you
You need entropy
Which isn't well defined either
oh
My work isn't so useful for mathematicians
Where my work is important
Is in computer science and physics
Careful not to jump outta a plane without a parachute with ur theorizing
You're missing the point
What are you really asking?
Like this nothing is certain and everything lies on abstract ideas. Everything can't be perfect but over many years these theories have come across by which we can gain some certainty. I would not delve too much on the uncertainties but again I don't know too much yet.
Nope, the binomial theorem gives you the probability of such a sequence during one trial
I'm telling you binomial theorem won't give you the right answer haha
If you mark a save state and do that one trial 8576278294672 times, how will shit turn out?
Which makes them able to have statistical fluctuations
So that's the tool used to work with those
What's something that isn't well behaved?
i wish
How I thought of the coin is like how electrons work in QED
Your asking how often will the coin work like a coin
ok you really lost me, what?
The trippy part isn't there actually
You can describe how much is able to be known
WTF are these theories. HOW ARE THEY SO MANY TERMINOLOGIES FOR EVERYTHING
@inexorablesalmon Presenting the scope of your discussion more succinctly will prevent you from jumping outta a plane without a parachute
Definitely sounds like some wild shit tho
Did It work?
I don't live to avoid pain tho
If I fell so be it
Ooh idk him
How far you want to take things
This was the class
You don't happen to mean Ramsey thesis in Ramsey theory pertaining to the order in sufficiently large sets do you?
Finals: Cursed propositions for sex
zhanda is quite the internet troll
this one has me dead EVERY SINGLE TIME
yall can't tell rn but im wheezing again
that why franklin left?
HOLY FUCK LMFAO
MY STOMACH HURTS
it was fucking delicious
The Costco near me recently started selling "Flamin' Hot" cookies
wtf lmao
oh shit
sichuan food slapps, but idk about that
hell yeah its some dope shit
cuz im a god
@everyone wake up it’s time for school
Oh idk why i didn’t notice that
Yeah idk either
9:29 am. Not bad
As in: I’m disappointed _that you are alive_
i can't
fair enough
I didn't take BIOL 214, what does it say?
It's from last semester
cuz w/ neosef, if you arent getting the free food they would have under nonrona
Rip
I loved science fair in hs
Uhhhh idk the exact unit price but we paid the full price for each sandwich
I can’t remember
David you will speedrun your qualifying exams
Oh
I don't speedrun exams, ever. Even on exams where I'm 99% sure I'm going to get an A, I take all the time available
I might actually go but I legit don’t have any cash
I don’t have that either lol
We're broke students who don't have any money to give
I know there are some geniuses who regularly leave halfway through an exam but I don't have that confidence yet
zhanda never had chickfila
Okay those people who publicly announce that they are done with an exam in just half the allowed time are cocky
me during the math 122 test
I wanted to leave as soon as I was done but I don't trust myself like that
https://discord.com/channels/669280377680035842/670474509244956672/816708842833838111 @howdy_. we don’t. We have half with pickles and half without pickles
So no spicy, sorry
I remember that @ansh8867 finished the MATH 122 final in half the alloted time
Wait it's just til 1:30pm? rip
I mean sometimes that's me but not because I want to get it done first but because I've already gone through the dang exam 2 more times and there's no point staying
I don't get people who just turn in an exam who don't check their answers unless the test/exam doesn't matter
Got an exam in 1 hr
Ope rip
rip
that face is scary dhanajay :pepe_sweat:
It depends on the exam of course
For instance, in bio we have 50 multiple choice questions in 1 hour 15 minutes
I don't need 1 hour 15 minutes for 50 questions lol
What class is it for?
Fingers crossed it isnt too bad
I'm not worried about my econ classes, I'm worried about getting bad grades in Data Structures or Linear Algebra
Those classes are hard
@chandachan Bruh, I already got my chem grade for the exam I took two days ago.
Eileen is damn productive. She goes through everything instantly
Wtf
I got homework graded at 10 AM when I submitted it at 2:30 AM 👀
Damn
Oooh I think we sold out
i havent even watched one piece
and one of them is attack on titan which doesnt count
it definitely doesnt
yeah its an anime but it doesnt contribute to being a weeb
eren is the definition of cringe though
jenin discussing aot without participating in class smh
even if i am a weeb, i need to assert that aot is different
i mean to be clear, if we want to go by the actual definition of weeb theres like a 0% chance im a weeb but people are just memeing here
its specifically means ur obsessed with japanese culture and shit
i dont give a shit about japanese culture
like the really early one>
once they leave
The plot was so lost on me and I wasn’t willing to reread all those years
Damn not even Pokémon as a child
I have never watched doraemon
but i have never watched a single minute of doraemon
i remember nth from them tho
don't accuse me of being whitewashed either because i watch no tv show
Rip
bruh i wish
im sorry but hong kong tv is trash
its so bad
its all just soap operas with really bad messages
i'm don't know the names of one single actor from hong kong
you really thought hollywood was bad
it is, but its worse here
last time there was an plus sized actress who got death threats for being fat
by the way i don't know her name i just know the thing happened
i hate it here
i turned out fine but it wasn't fun
Now that I finally have Minecraft I realize I’m not even equipped to play the game Bc I’m scared of all the mobs lol
ur not scared of sheep
her reasoning was that "i want you to learn about honor"
Sometimes I come around a corner too fast and get scared by a sheep tho
Which one is kill bill
Anything can be scary if ur squared up enough
even if it meant dying
also she wanted me to be inspired to learn kung fu
i wasn't
I did enough sport in my first 10 years of life that I don’t have to move ever again until I die
i didn't do enough sport lol
i wasn't forced to do anything as a child so i don't have resentment against any activity rn
Never played a team sport but regardless ur not missing much
Never played sportsball either
i wasn't really good
Dodgeball is unfair because arm sports suck
i would never talk about sports tho
thats _really_ boring
Rip
Isn’t that the week before that tiny break we get
thats overall a bad thing. its a good thing because it means you havent seen any anime but its also a bad thing because it means you havent seen attack on titan, which outweighs the good of having not seen other anime
the point isnt for it to be an intro show
aot and that one anime i got introduced to about a group of teenagers who got into a plane crash and are stranded on some island in some weird time warp shit
basically lost
lol idk that one
Lol Lost
you want sth short and not heavy
its basically lost
oh i forgot u stopeed after season 3 :thonk:
it's a bit long tho
No of Lost the tv show
Oh
I guess Ozguner is making his own class then
the premise is basically Lost
I am enjoying bnha Bc I’m sad superhero nerd
i am as close to the anti-weeb as possible
Oh
Data Structures is my most time-consuming class right now and I think I'm still spending less time on it than I did on Java
Nah that dude was wild he didn’t like anime but fetishized the entire Japanese culture without it just fine
I don't understand why underclassmen buy anything if they're on the meal plan because all of their meals are already covered
he turned 211 two days ago
I have played one of his songs I think but I also don’t care ab piano anymore to remember
yeah i was gonna wish u a happy birthday if u still had your chopin pfp
Once I'm on the meal plan, I don't plan to eat anything that costs money and isn't on the meal plan
That counts since the meal plan has some CaseCash that will go to waste if you don't use it
But I don't plan to go to any restaurants that don't take swipes from the card
I got kimchi from Whole Foods and I’m sad Bc it exploded and then it was also shredded
i never tried kimchi
Ooo never had it
oh the korean style yellow pickled turnips
I don’t wanna see u round my streets anymore
speaking of wasting cucumbers i don't think coring a cucumber is considered wasting
idk what ur on mosses
i want the homogeneous crunch
dont want them slime
But the second one was too thick and bad
I want it all to b red
i forgot its name though 🤡
kinda expensive tho :D
beets dont normally look like that
I only have one assignment due over the next 5 days
Too lucky. Only done with 1 of them. I still have 2 assignments left
oh
Imagine having a cold ass hoagie with that
ansh, david does nothing but rise and grind
There was an apple frappucino so I just wanted to try it out.
i still get tim horton's cuz it's cheaper that starbucks
but there aren't many tim hortons in the area
I need caffeine though
to be fair, I had an ungodly amount of work over the last week or so
a tall hot chocolate at starbucks at pune airport is 7 freaking dollars
airport stuff is always more spensive
i don't have time to grind coffee
I'm using a grinder that takes one button click and takes a minute. Only downside is that's it's **really** loud
i don't get preground. i get ground. preground is instant coffee
NEVER with sugar
I used to have that Nesquik bottles you get near the gas station during childhood road trips
6-pack David. Damn. I have family pack on the other hand
I also had a lot of cavities in my teeth in the past so I'm trying to reduce sugar consumption
We don't read history. We write history :dab:
I have a full belly because I ate too much
it's days like this I'm convinced that the world ended in 2012 and everything since then has been a gradually unwinding hallucination
Then don't eat much. I'm a foodie tho yet one time I skipped dinner coz I was too lazy to walk to Den
I don't see the channel on slack
What's that meme tho
Put Alp tho
idk how, I just found it on another discord
Omg
What's discussed on the group tho?
I mean I just joined, there doesn't seem to be that much going on lol
anyway back to work
damn
I walk into that pen and my inventory is nothing but eggs lmfao
zack do you want a huggy?
@everyone pls hug zack he is suffering from erectile dysfunction
Internet shows some smoker's multi tool instead
Someone please tell me to study
Ok, going back to study session. Any one wants to join
Lol “we’re sorry too many people are accessing this website are the same time”
ugh
david that would be my worst nightmare
well then rip
i couldnt but some people sent the link in our group me
Sorry guys for cutting the convo
Anyome having problems with canvas???
Just one month in and I feel I got all at the same time
Wtf this semester
agreed this semester is much worse than last
It's annoying how easily our productivity can be disrupted
All it takes is a small distraction and then you go for an hour with almost nothing done
happens to me daily sadly
ugh
same tho
well if we didn't have google the entire internet would fall apart lmao
the internet is nothing w/o google
i wish ecosia was as good as google
You shouldn't be?
yea i didnt get the email
idk
there is someone named "rounak" on this call
For every giant proprietary software there exists a sometimes better, mostly shittier open source software out there. Meaning as long as we have nerds we will have some familiar form of the internet
i think it would be too much for the internet
ight bet u wont
I use PyMol which is a biochem tool that is at its core Python, and I know how to use that but it is limited and I don't want to be forever dependent on Matlab
Will my pycharm license expire tho?
It won't expire as long as you have a campus email afaic but you're supposed to be an enrolled student to use it
You need an email and I'm pretty sure license doesn't expire if you're still a student
Damn I'm just going through some tutorials and Python is really clean lol
Although I dont know much
You could also stop studying so much and be content with lower grades
It just depends on what you want
^ not a bad idea
Not bad
I got 4 points wrong tho😭
Just had a brutally hard ECON 342 exam today 🤡
oh
I've heard that the professor's curve is really generous though
Sad
Oh
im in my phys si rn. cant type properly lol
I hate multiple choice to be honest, I understand that it's convenient but I don't like it
i do not have the ability to study for hours at a stretch. once i hit 2 hours i stop for a break
what's the answer to number 5 i didn't catch it
I nearly got a B in MATH 122 last semester because it was multiple choice tests
oh no not a B
BIOL 215 has multiple choice homework where you only get one try, right?
idk how i've been able to do ok in my bio hw assignments
In most of my classes, it's very doable to get a 90+ % on homework if you're putting in the effort
bruh how did you get that cuz i got 420
I have no idea what's going on in linear algebra but I have a 100/100 average on the homework
yeah getting an A in bio and chem is doable but you gotta study a LOT which is just :')
that's not that bad
In Calculus III last semester I got 10 tries on almost all questions with full credit
i want half credit
oh that's kind of a rip
oh damn
Yeah, it's online automatically graded homework
oh whale
I don't have a problem with WebAssign because the instant feedback can be nice, but it shouldn't be too hard
I don't have any classes right now with automatically graded homework
yea fun how most upper div classes don't have auto grading except some CS classes
I was going to do Discussions but I completely forgot about it lol
I was going to do it but then a winter storm hit and then I missed the deadline to join review
I have class from 2-4 so
I forgot about a lot of clubs and now im too shy to join this late
how long does med school take?
She will open her clinic near Houston so I can get free eye exams
bro i hope 😭 i hope covid doesn't force me to take a gap year
nah i don't like hot weather
I don't think she likes Houston
Doesn't your insurance cover that?
i like the career tho
I've never been to an ophthalmologist but I've seen optometrists many times
yeah but if I ever need LASIK
Now I can't read very well without glasses
My vision may be the worst part of my health
idk if i trust lasik for my power
there's always a chance that lasik could fail
what do u want?
i can't stand poverty what can i say
no idea. i don't plan to live in india tho
I wish to see poverty ended as well, ideally no one would be poor
poor is a relative term. you can never get rid of it
Poor is the natural state of humans
well poverty is like when u cant rly afford basics
Doctors don't hold much respect in China
theres like numbers and shit
also their measures of just looking at money u spend isnt rly accurate
Wasn't just months ago that Xi jinping said extreme poverty in chin was canceled?
can you imagine how many asian americans were forced to become doctors like that's sad
> China's poverty rate fell from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015
Indigenous nations that want to stay independent are part of the extreme poverty ounting ? :thonk:
There are indigenous tribes that want to stay independent and don't even use currencies for anything
$1.9 a day isn't that much, even in very low cost of living places
I agree that there's still a long way to go, but there's been a lot of progress
Sadly, COVID-19 has caused poverty rates to increase in many parts of the world
@.fim. I don't know
Eh infant mortality doesn’t cover the full scope of idk, living a life fully lol
china isnt communist
oh
I would say tho probably the issue for using only mortality/life expectancy doesn’t measure for the quality of life of disabled ppl
@sprinkles2108 China is ruled the communist party of china, which was originally supposed to be a Marxist-Leninist party, which means that their goal was to use socialism as a transitional phase to bring about communism (this is a simplification obviously), and for a while they were (arguably) pretty socialist, but even they never claimed to actually have a achieved communism. but now, mostly thanks to Deng-era reforms, they have liberalized their economy and are capitalist, although the government does have a fair amount of control over the corporations. the corporations often work hand in hand with the government, and it's sometimes called "state capitalism" (although that term is used to describe a lot of totally different systems) but it is still very much capitalist as business are owned privately by shareholders and billionaires
Life expectancy by age seems to b a weird metric what would u use it for
A messaging app is a messaging app whether it’s on a laptop or phone lol
True, China is second in # of billionaires if I'm not wrong
youre not wrong
It means that people that are 70 years old now can expect to have more years left than people that were 70 years old in the past, so people of all ages can expect to live longer, and that increases in life expectancy at birth are not caused purely by solving health problems associated with infants
That doesn’t account for quality of life tho
I gotta bounce tho
quality of life is also much lower in china than in the us because in china people dont get to live in the same country as me
Rober bye
am i wrong
@raunakwastaken how does it feel to not live in the same country as me
Relativism hitting hard
damn it didnt work cause he didnt respond
it sucks, right?
I do not think that’s tru, u are not sharing my pain so my quality of life isn’t improving
I’m sending a ss of this to office of equity
raunak dont do this
dont u remember what we had
You didn’t send a hairy pic of yours
I’m mad
you really don't
I dont know how to😅
Oh icic
Nope
I don't know.
You didn’t send me anything
Something happened?
You will go to the Office of Equity like @ansh8867
You will not go to the Office of Equaity like @ansh8867 .
with office of equity?
Finn is silent. Maybe he has already been called by the office of equity
idk lol
It do close at 8
i will chop off your left testicle
u dont need to be quick
i dont delete messages
Dark mode hurts my eyes
Priyanka you don’t have @sprinkles2108
They're closed
fml
I wanted to have chicken shawarma :blobloveslep:
Yea I doubt they’d expect any super last minute ppl
the white background hurts my eyes
Rip
Y tho
@raunakwastaken I haven't done anything
The dont mind another semester remote
There’s a rule that you need to enter the US within 6 months of visa approval. I didn’t enter the US within 6 months. Lmao
So you can't come next sem also. 😫
dang it won't be worth it to steal then
We could have gone to get dinner
College is college is college
folks need money
Understandable, I managed to find a work study luckily
u dont
just steal the money 🤦‍♀️
As if work study does anything lol
work study isnt that good imo
Omg Jenin did you not see my job posting
No shit lol
but if you want the money so you can go to school
No need for work study if u remote
yeah so im saying just get a job instead
I mean I would still have needed work study remote or nah
It’s only fair
Next year probs won’t b as kind tho 😢
im so sorry
What happened this time?
Shit happens
I'm hungry
I think I’m not gonna have enough dip for my chip tho
MY MOM WAS TOO TIRED TO COOK
we will after tn lol we can't eat sm
This is not fair 😩
Oh with unlimited there isn’t one
You could always just pay with actual casecash tho
That doesn't make sense
Just go thru regular menu and pay w casecash
Den doesn't accept meal plan now
Oh, they don't accept two orders at once
The angry avocado , rough rider pizza etc. are all closed still
it sells tho rn
Though I need to stop pigging out
I don’t wanna gain weight
I wish teachers were more respected here in America
Nope they just get yelled at
I know and it’s annoying
You're still stuck in the soup and the race
omg i was featured in it 🤪
He does? I don't remember
oh
I don't watch many Indian movies, White Tiger is the exception
Do you think his action is justified tho?
Spoiler alert: Killing the owner
i didn't
i didnt
Wow what if i wanted to watch
i. didn't.
i didnt
But then I won’t gasp if I kno the ending
That’s boring
huh what happened?
what is wrong with me
oh I know your ass ain't talking
zack stfu or i will literally hug you
i hardly watch bollywood movies anymore
I ain't gay but I would be gay for Professor Snape  😩
that doesnt make sense
omg
Dhokha (Heart broken) 🤡
bhabi doesnt mean wife

Nobel wanna work on it now
I'm still here
wtf is going on rn
oh my god, i'm already in a relationship though 😦
sorry raunak
hush, she doesnt have to know
No don't do that. My sages professor says never cheat on someone

i actually hate anime
Gosh I need to go to the cat cafe on the westside
i've never watched it
I need to pet pets

You did not say Corey in the House so therefore your statement is wrong
right across from my room too so please don't get TOO wild at night
it's my house stupid
wtf is that?
cuz i stole your visa
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.
nothing
oh shit wrong reply. that was for neel
I am a concerned mother with a 13 year old child and I am here to seek help regarding my son. Last week when we went to the supermarket, my son pointed to a red trash can and started jumping around screaming “THAT’S AMONG US! THAT TRASH CAN IS SUS! RED IS THE IMPOSTOR!” As soon as he did that, the manager told us to leave. I told him that my son is just excited about something, and apologised. But the manager still told us to leave so I picked up the red trash can that my son was going crazy over and threw it on the managers head. Then my son shouted “DEAD BODY REPORTED.” Can someone please tell me what on earth is wrong with him?

Don’t have camera on
oh nvm i remembered
neel wanna make our lights fuck
wont we dhananjay 😉
and do math
Raunak, you have to save some for poor people like us also man. You can't take everyone
Sex dungeons are meant to b shared tho smh
Damn
It's EXAM WEEK 😤😤 and it's TIME ⏱⏱ to WHIP OUT 😯😯 your EDUCATION ERECTIONS 🎒📚🍆🍆 and FUCK THESE FINALS 🤣🤣😉😉.

The limit of Raunak running towards Dhananjay is a multi-variable function. So there is no opposite direction. Raunak can come from any direction in the x-y plane as a curve or straight line.
where do you find all these copy pastas
or you will have bad luck today
@stuckinohiolads send it to 11 people or else you fail the soci(alist)ology exam
I think its just that there aren’t massive wage differences between STEM disciplines and other common high pay jobs in China

I’m pissed
What happened?
I want to eventually switch to Shredded Wheat though, it's even better than Cheerios
It's objectively better but I don't have the willpower
back in the day, burn victims were prescribed eggs, cuz having a shit ton of em worked as good as steroids
cuz its an alt
People are annoying
is it tho
Well I left because I don't have anything to do with the server
And I'm about to leave for the fourth time
its only bad when its poggerested
idk what that even means
@chandachan I got it wrong, I missed an earlier instance, so you joined FOUR times in total
they need to change their logo to
and I just left again, so 5
Ok so I was checking the student code of conduct since this seems to be a case of impersonation, and it looks like what this user "error" did might be a violation of Article III Section B Clause 19.c of the Student Code of Conduct, which prohibits the use of another person's identity and/or password, which is exactly what happened when the user impersonated Raunauk
The coincidence is super weird though
neel isnt that dum
nah, they can see how many ppl used  it tho
in servers i ran, we used invitemanager to see who invited who
somehow i doubt it tho
unfortunately invmanager is down half the time
Anyway Raunauk is pissed and understandably so. I initially didn't want to go on a hunt for the user as it would be unproductive and I think they got the memo, but Raunauk brought the impersonation to my attention and it seems this is a much bigger deal that I initially thought given that a professor is on that server
without a live monitoring tool u basically cant tell
i generally don't like big public statements cuz they feel tacky
I don’t know Arabic
lol wtf
Oh
They’re still on the server
nvm it wasnt arabic, it was some other character spam
@sprinkles2108 no they're gone
David are you lowkey trying to imply that it was me 🙄
no you spelled it wrong
VPNs would do nothing to get around a server ban
Oh dang
Oh
cuz u don't even know
Jokes on you I don't have any dorming money because I'm off campus
oh?
well that died quickly

Apparently, Zachary Attackery's hometown is one of the richest in America
apparently i'm 6000 miles away
Sorry*
i wish
I have a massive telescope but I never use it
lol i wanted to be a astrophysicist for a few years
I can't believe you looked that closely at my background
damn zhanda pays a lot of attention lmao
@zacharious You feel ready for the Discrete Math exam tomorrow?
Ngl, I thought the practice exam was harder than the homework
It got me a little worried
I just tried to breathe life back into the 2022 server
what a boomer, being class of 2022
Tf is wrong with Bader. 1 hour 40 minute lecture and he goes around with his stories of history and shit. Idgaf what happened in 1950's and crap. Then, why and how for each and every detail
Why do you want to know? 👀
Don’t you dare bring Eileen into any degeneracy whatsoever
So you want to send them messages on Discord?
Na. I just want to see how life will be in 2 years time. Also more the information the merrier if I want to be TA or so
That's the right link, idk why it isn't working
Nope
Trying using this button on the left side of your screen to add it
Please leave the server alone; those people really don't want to be spammed
I feel like you joined more to see the havoc zhanda and raunak were wreaking
I didn’t know that they wrecked havoc until I joined
Idk
Like I don't want to come off as PepeHands
yeah, i think I went too far in dms
he still is fym "looked"
i meant like he isnt a babi anymore
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.
sorry but you said ruffian and that's all that comes to my mind LMFAO
@chandachan you didn't impersonate Raunauk in the Art Server did you?
@nobelium19 I got your ticket for the computer in KSL lol, I'm working on fixing it
I broke myself today
He broke himself
Hahaha lobe that that went to the wrong everyone
Nd so now I can't move for like
3-6 weeks
oh no
I literally stretched 2 hard :/
And now I can't stand lol
Lol do you work at KSL?
No I work for UGen IT which manages the computers at KSL
shut the fuck up I'm spreading positivity
@inexorablesalmon yo I’m so sorry to hear that and I hope you recover soon!
Thanks for feel better wishes, @chandachan  @sprinkles2108 ?everyone else?
damn
Damn take care
thats some rough shit
I spent 45 min alone going all the way to Veale testing center and getting ruled sheets of paper and coming back. It's fun
Still can't rly move
V ouch
You have multiple splenius, and considering that is one of the deep and most broad muscles in the neck, if you truly tore it you need to go to a doctor. An origin or insertion tear in the manner that you're speaking of will need surgical repair.
Furthermore, a muscle tear that large will likely cause a large hematoma in an area which is directly adjacent to the carotid artery, possible compressing it
i dont fink u tore ur splenius methinks u pulled sumfin probablay
@raunakwastaken i just realized your nickname can be Rubidium since its chemical symbol is Rb lol
omg boost our server
sorry already boosted another
fair
can't please everyone
omg no the green virus hits different tho
they contribute tho :(((
it wasn't bad until people falsely accused raunak and neel for it
I just learned that we don't have class on March 16th and 24th
oh great, uninterrupted study days
like no, i'm gonna be studying for my second bio exam LOL
and crying over matlab
that won't do anything
oh whale it's only a month
no clue - i got an emial with a link saying "Your new SpartaIRB profile, which was recently requested for/by you, has been created." but idk why LL
I don't what Sparta IRB is
Oh my alt has that
Idk
And find out
OH SIT
shit
Imma fail BIOL 214. I'm outta here
You're a straight-A student, how could you fail BIOL 214?
dude if I didn't fail biol 214 there's no way on earth that you will
I did trash on the first exam. Stupid MCQ's not too bad on written section but still
define "trash" cuz i got a 78 and was pretty upset too
To be fair though, as a pre-med, wouldn't getting a B in BIOL 214 look really bad? I guess that you could call getting a B kind of failing in that case
tbh, there are so many filler points in an online 214 class that it wasn't too difficult getting a solid grade
last semester the class was out of 900 points. of those, 450 points were exams
I'm shocked, in most of my classes the exams are like 80 percent of the grade
you needed to miss 108 points at most to end with an 88 which was an A
Mine was also like that. I messed up MCQ's tho
same. i missed the most points on mc. it takes practice tbh and reading the textbook like a bible
Only class I'm taking this semester that isn't exam heavy (Data Structures) has 45 percent of the grade from homework but the homework is actually kind of hard
Fml
it would help to change your study methods if you want to
He goes on saying stories about 1950's and shit
i never paid attention in his online zoom lectures
that's what happened to me in chem 105: 83 to a 67 to a 63 💀
I don't see how it could be anything else. Here's an archetypal example of how my semesters go:
First exam: find the speed of this position function at point c.
Third exam: Find the triple integral of this function between the coordinate planes and this plane, represented by a tetrahedron.
Third exam is way harder
First exam: what's the cross product
Second exam: Arc length of curve
Third exam: Triple integral over the intersection between two cones, an ellipsoid and a hyperbola
the one strategy that didn't fail on me was studying the textbook word-for-word and that's the one advice most 214 survivors give
i've never taken ochem and i'm jumping into it this fall:ramsay:
Oof, even most of the people who survive BIOL 214 won't make it to the finish line
cuz i really like gen chem
I've heard that OChem is the hardest premed class
And you still got an A in Chem 105. Impressive
College in a nutshell
I've stayed up until 3 AM doing homework even though I knew it was bad for my health
me too but studying for the 105 final
for once i forced myself to sit for more than 3 hours at a stretch to study lol
for a class
i should go take my exam now cy'all
You can take your exam when you want?
Which exam?
yep. we have the whole week to take the exam. 3 hours for a 50-minute test and it's open note
3 hours? that seems very generous
Which class is that
stats class but for the psych major
Lucky. In my CS exam this morning, the professor made sure that we didn't get one extra second over an hour
What CS exam?
Discrete Math
Oh math
Some people kept writing like five minutes after the exam ended and he called them out
oh yeah he told us to stop writing when we hit 60 mins
my exam rn is a math exam too haha
anyway imma head out and review for the exam once and take it so ttyl
I took Economic Psychology last semester and the professor spent a good amount of time talking about what he didn't like about psychology
Take your exam already
Never
You need to do deep breathing and Surya Namaskar before the exam @sprinkles2108
tbh ik this exam won't be bad but still i nervous LOLLLLLL
That doesn't mean it's easy
In my Linear Algebra class, only two definitions are provided on the exams
The professor was saying "If you don't remember it then you don't understand it"
But in all actuality the results don't matter!
I can't be a doctor anymore
CHILL. OUT. AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WITH HIGH-FUNCTIONING ANXIETY.
This isn't reassuring if you really want to practice medicine though
You're not fucked, one B alone won't destroy your chances
Which isn't possible to control
I'm not really crying tho
Also, even if you don't go to med school, since you're a BME major, you can get a good engineering job out of college
Generally, I would cry
How much did you even get?
That you’re this sad
A single B isn't catastrophic
Srsly tho I encourage you all to pursue what what you like in each moment
lol someone freaking out over a single B? classic
he got a similar grade as to what i got on 214's E1 last semester. he's gonna be ok
@chandachan Tell Ansh that he can get a nice BME job if he doesn't go to med school
u can easily get a B on a test and still get an A anyways so
so its hard to parse when u scan it
77? I understand your pain
@chandachan i will beat you to death
Finn pls keep your micro aggressiveness away from this server
It’s kinda sad that y’all are actually calculating that
U right I can't count
you didn't specify the number system smh
Problem not solvable cause I didn’t feel like it
I felt like solving it because I wanted to know what the number was
Zhanda wtf
They're like w-woah man slow down
I got 84s on two Calculus II exams and still managed to get an A
Just study really hard every day for the next exam
Ok guys, its time for a math problem. Little Johnny is a premed student at CWRU. Johnny wants to get an A in his class because he knows med school is hard to get into. His class has 4 tests; 3 normal tests and final. The normal tests are worth 20% of his grade and the final is worth 40%. If Johnny got a 75% on the first test, an 85% on the second test, and a 82% on the third test, what score does he need on the final in order to get an A in the class? An A means 90% or more.
wtf is this lol
I don't know I found it in cursed memes a while back
anyways sorry to detract from the convo
cold
someone was wearing shorts and slides though
Just don't get a B in anything else and you should be on track for Harvard Med
In all honesty, I don't think he will end up with a B in the class
Getting a C is quite uncommon unless you just don't show up for class
i dont think getting c is that uncommon
damn
just leave
@_frostyyyyy_ theres still missing info tho cause e dont know the rest of the dist.
aight imma head out
It's not hard to be in the top 35 percent if you're trying though
3.7 aint too bad lmaoooo
Aight imma head out now
Most people don't study hard so if you're studying a lot then 3.5+ is quite doable
David flexing hard ngl
oh damn u right i thought it was like 35%
David aren't you in the 99 IQ club
makes sense tho
The stupid online tests show 133- 140's
oh
doesnt it mean that 2/3 is within that range or smt like that
0.3% is the shit above 3 and below -3
She's taking an exam right now so she can't respond
Which exam?
Damn wut
Which exam takes place at night?
cause half is above half is below
You can take it when you want
I think the exams are open for a 3-hour limit
Damn
i wasnt alive
Nope
Damn

They were heading in the direction of most Cwru students' worst nightmare: where poor people live
my guess would b down 115th
well they arent at the right school if they tryna stay away from poor people
omg there was a shooting? When? dang.....
not rly? i mean they chose to come to cleveland so avoiding poor people clearly isnt that high on their list
sorry
ive never seen a black person before and i live in cleveland
have you left ur room?
sadly
but still didnt see any
This person on Instagram is obsessed with Cleveland and keeps posting about Cleveland’s racial and economical demographics
Basically how we’re not a diverse school
fair
i mean thats what happens when ur school costs 50k and doesnt cover need
It’s kinda sad IMO
a globalising China can’t keep up with the times
it sounds like theyre posting stuff other people arent talking about that much
Didn't see his ass at the protests this summer
He’s also a photographer it seems
I think he had pre med in it at one point but I could be wrong
idk what action would be there :thonk:
Increase awareness I guess
I have never heard of this person and I've been p involved at time with activism here and
isnt that what he is doing
I guess pressure cwru admin
I just hate that sort of thing
Oh fucking hell
God damn thunder god 🌩️
And fucking
I SHIT YOU NOT
I wanted to scream
i mean he's not wrong, they do look bad
they always look bad
and tell him that Finn owsley wants to fight him
He wants to be a doctor.
I hate it
Don’t fetishise
nothing can ever b truely deleted
I get the white guilt vibe from him don’t u?
Oh fuck
Does he not understand the concept of “show don’t tell”
This shit is so r/im14andthisisdeep
I don’t give a shit
Sorry but logic man
So from the people that I know who know the thunder god, he's apparently extremely smart, just really odd
“Just really odd”

Wow I would have never figured that one out
that would be implying I still live in pierce
it just rubs u the wrong way
My advice still stands
On Inauguration Day he wished Trump a teary eyed goodbye
oh
I however refuse to concede an inch of ideological ground to someone who thinks Trump is a god
Hey man patriotism isn’t a crime
i might if he posts some dumb shit
Well the expect a looooooot of dumb shit
During the Capitol riots he was concerned...with Josh Hawley’s book being taken down by his publishers
Whining about fucking censorship
Maybe he shoulda been worried about that Ashli Babbitt pack not being sparked
we need an edit of that gif for margret thatcher
I still can’t believe the cognitive dissonance in those idiots who thought Joe Biden, the literal textbook definition of a neo-lib, was bringing communism to America
@everyone wake up it’s school time
ight do that shit then
simple solution to force urself to get shit done: gimme $100, and u get it back with $10 extra if u get ur shit done, otherwise i spend it all on lottery tickets and u get none of the winnings
It’s a sad cat shaking that’s exactly how I feel
Gimme $1000. Bigger incentive to study
Money doesn’t scare me
why haven't we changed the the server's picture
we really are
cam was working on a babs, probs got delayed due to exams
There's a lot of paths to success other than med school
Uhm yeah one bad grade in an intro bio class doesn’t mean you can’t be a doctor
It also doesn’t mean anything in the context of life to be honest
nah, it wouldn't look bad as long as you show improvement and passion for the field in other parts of your medical school apps
YOU NEVER RESPONDED TO NY TEXT JENIN
i'm sorry 🥺
sorry
A B in biology isn't that big of a deal as long as you don't get too many other Bs
@djsurti sorry
wait but david didn't you just say that a B in biol 214 is really bad grade lol
If you want to go to med school, it doesn't look great
a few don't look bad. consistently poor grades do
guess.
Last I checked you’re not a med school admissions officer
I'm not going to disagree with you, but it really depends on what you're trying to do
damn
@_frostyyyyy_ is this the average chance of getting into each school they apply to, or is this the chance of getting into at least one med school?
So like even if you do get “a lot” of Bs it’s not like you just can’t be a doctor?? Or any other healthcare professional??
is this the average chance of getting into each school they apply to, or is this the chance of getting into at least one med school?
He has festered his seeds in the stomach of @ansh8867
oh shooy
i need to chang eit
r u not studying smh
No i did my first set of practice problems
zhanda we will ping u instead
cuz we have to ping someone
Who is this poor person
more than one ping doesnt rl matter that much
It's the average chance of getting into *any* medical school
grades aren't the only factor that make or break your application
Nobel is stupid
I relate to this so much omg
i didn’t kick him lmfao
Oh sorry
It was someone else
You did criticize him though
so hard to recognize
idk about ansh
Nope
We need to have a custom frost emoji
i can add a hug emote if u guys want :eyes2:

I’m sorry
i literally didn’t report u
You are worse than Donald Trump @ansh8867
y’all need to chill
I tried talking to you, but you threw your old socks at me
I need it
To the office of equity
The Office of Equity and I have reached the consensus that you will be expelled from the university.
:hug1:
Not so bad also. Today, there was batter-crusted fish
That wasn't a real ping
Smh you know better than that David, I'm disappointed in you
David has turned to the dark side
Sam hug me
OH
:hug1:
this shit happened so long ago can u please calm down..
sorry
I didn't
@user714 sorry, I will buy you food Thomas
@user714 Sorry for the comment

That's even worse
alt + tab between dr java and discord is pain
That's where all the bad action is
It's dead

Omg. Was he able to change gears?

-8ball Do I hate Raunak
we've missed you
back in the day when all the highways were capped at 55mph, ppl crashed cuz they fell asleep on the road since it was so damn slow
which class?
One of my greatest frustrations in life is that the "I'm semi, I stay automatic. Money add then multiply, I call it mathematic magic" song is not longer
@chandachan I just realized that your Discord interface is in French
@chandachan wants that full immersion
@howdy_. sorry howdy I love you ❤️
here's a hug
i think zach just died on his keyboard
Power went out twice for a minute each time in the last 24 hours
Confirm Zach that you are still alive?
I live in The Energy Capital Of The World but the lights have gone out several times in the last day
why is it so bad
why can't they keep the power on
I've been in Ohio since 2008 and I can only remember 2 times where the power went out for a minute or longer
Although it's probably happened while I'm sleeping
its cuz we're connected to the eastern nrg grid
we didnt pull a dum like texas did
and cut ourselves off and then charge outragous prices
because privatized utilities suck ass
dirty mind arent u
I don't get it
i've been in ohio my whole life:kittyvibe:
excluding my time since july
i've lived in the US for less than 3 months total 🤡
the computer will give you an error
and you can't typecast state to city
I wanna learn tho
FUCK LIGHT MODE I HOPE WHOEVER THOUGHT OF IT HAS THEIR BONES SHATTERED AND SKIN TORN OFF
You lost me at "solve"
Ok I am scared now....
Short flight anyways
But I'm prob already on plenty of FBI or cia watch list due to my questionable YouTube and social media browsing history so
Fuck it
In fact if u really want, find me outside of cma tmrw
I feel like there r only so many maxwells in this school
@speedbirdconcorde2 really?
Nope I'm a sophomore and moved out
step 1: Don’t find validation in others
awww nou
Cause she had it cut
how else would someone's hair be short
She even goes to sleep while holding it
She can’t sleep otherwise
rumors are that you don't even hold the flute anymore, it has merged into your face
This is a BIG if though
I didn't say it was, I literally said the opposite
someone blow wind on Jenin
I know I would collapse under the pressure of both pre-med and engineering though
That's why don't take pressure lik e myua
"handle" the work load like passing all the classes is one thing, graduating with a 4.0 so u stand a chance to any big name med school (including case med school) is another
You don't have to graduate with 4.0 only
I'm doing group homework with a BME major with a 4.0 GPA though
work on lab
If there are any weekend plans, hmu
He didn't give a score, only percentile, but the lowest score that gives 100th percentile is 524
What is the weekend plans. I'm tired of staying in dorm @chandachan @nobelium19 @djsurti @moseslee
Weekend plans maadi
and that he would like someone to accompany him
bruh u dunno what cap is?
God, David is lonely indeed
oh?
keeping it a buck it was kinda boring
I haven't been there
Too busy studying to go outside
Seriously tho, what are you doing tmrw
I don't study
Studying 😔
I've been listening to lot of songs here and community is getting damn boring rn
Sometimes Indian Idol. Bigg boss is over, which is sad.

jenin never invites me to anything unlucko :(
Nope

That the quote isn’t from Reddit
Just one it seems
cuz we live in suites
oh

ah ok rip sorry my roommate and i come in a package lol
wtf
oh shit it's march
*too cold for march*
thats mildly concerning that it would be that complicated to begin with tho
I mean unless u wanna be stuck in a shitty dorm
i can't believe we're already planning out sophomore year
~~we won't get overthrown with another covid right?~~
Shitty dorms + shitty ppl tho
still dunno if im gonna b living on campus bud
i aint rich like u finn
i aint on campus :P
but you were on campus last semester :thonk:
i also was not on campus last semester
I cant b above neel, he's on top
Zhanda, howdy wants to be suite mates with us
even in academics tho he's a big brain
@howdy_. how does the room selection thing work? Do we need to find suite mates beforehand?
I don’t understand it tho
oh
its due by end of march
rip
actual rip tho we have to look for more suitemates
You don’t *have* to
they will just pair you with another group that needs to b filled
oh
cuz i invited her to that server
Howdy totally doesn't live in Smith
To find suite mates
you dont have to
if you dont want to
who was going in alone
Zhanda you literally told me yesterday that you’d stop
zhanda, do you want to b bonked
The one where we never see u again
didn't y'all have the flower fest tho
He broke his neck
but the tickets were still bought :thonk:
:Hug:
:Hug:
nope he doesn't
i'd get that then, cuz if u dont get it
are you serious rn
case isnt gonna let u not pay for it
Why won’t I get visa lol
dunno
Zhanda let me rain on you
lol he doesn't have security tho
The stress ball with gell literally broke and I spent 15 minutes cleaning the mess
If autonomous vehicles are widely available in 3 years, then I may never drive
just don't be dumb
I really need to learn how to drive
driving fast af gets my blood pumpin
gets me close to God
it's not terribly hard
just dont crash, and u can drive
Don't drive so fast then
I need  a license. I know how to drive tho
Car goes brrr
y'all need to be taught some rules fr
Right now I can just use Uber if I want to get a ride but yeah, I'll need to drive a lot after I graduate
Big city traffic is a yikes lmfao
dont hit anyone
Getting caught is not poggers
Leave your gf
One last milk dud left
This milk dud is stuck in my teath
Cause we need a hug
I'm so sorry @user714 for always tagging you, let me hug you and spread the love 🫂
I ACCIDENTALLY HIT "SPEAK MESSAGE" AND HAD TO CLOSE MY LAPTOP
I don't understand this
I don't get it
@nobelium19 Nobel you don't want to live in a suite with me ?
He already said that I'm the only one that he could trust
He said he doesn’t trust us
We were sad
Zhanda, do you think Nobel doesn’t wanna stay with us cause we’re Asians?
Office of Equity
We need to  call the office of equity
Oh please don't. He'll get pissed again
Why can't you trust Zhanda tho?
🙄 Nobel trying to act fake now
I don't have anyone else
But I would cry at your funeral, if that makes you feel better
I’m dying
Don't act fake like Nobel now 😬
you forgot zacc
Damn zach left
*zach has left the chat*
What's that? I didn't find anything on Google about it
like how noah and his family didn't drown in the great flood cuz they built the ark
u would be surprised about many other wild shit the CIA pulled
Imagine if the earth suddenly stopped spinning around the axis
oh shit LMAO
lemme find it rq
I also forgot to mention hostile AI. Many people now view that as one of the greatest existential threats to humanity
just a slice of all the ways we can die!
Many thinkers believe that AI will be the cause of our demise
zac(h)(k)s dont wanna stay together
you replied to his text replying to me tho
frat people don't have social anxiety
Anyone here want to work for the CIA?
but i dont think they'll accept me
Seems like this is alleged and that they didn't acknowledge it
*pepe wants to know your location*
or "lost"
that shit involves hella pure math, esp with number and group theory
I understand that, it's not required for either math or EE
id be more focused on shit like topology and advanced diff eqs
david go work for NSA
so it might work
Zachary LeClaire says that he wants to do battle with you King Kerr.
He's trying to usurp the thunder god throne 😬
yup i am a power hungry warmonger
bitch, i don't need your sass
nor do i want it
I hate the fact that i've seen this meme sent in discord before
Tbh, is not even that bad, crickets are very nutritious, protein rich, clean insects and easy to grow, insects are eaten by many cultures, and disgust really is a relative term, some tribes might not eat animals normal for western society. Insects and plague insects are an option for any future world-spread hunger
ikr
and what is even worse
forgot about seeing it
discord is now light mode compared to this tho :xcrittyx:
oh I thought everyone used that
I don’t get it
OH
I wanted to talk about classical music but nobody really seems to
we will talk :culture: 
i think general was simply dead then
Yeah idk
They were making shit up on the spot
God damn dhananjay with the 6 pack
Oh LMAOOOOO
That makes sense, I was wondering for a while why you wouldn't trust Zach
I think Zach said he already has a group though
I don't think I'll be living in a suite
damn nobel you finna be fake
I think you could live on north if you wanted to
No but it's a suite so we don't live in the same room
Aren't suites less expensive?
Oh rly?
Your chang mian isn't the only thing that's long 😉
Idk
I thought you wanted to live in an apartment
as for pieces I've lately been into schumann's piano concerto, brahms piano concerto 2, brahms violin concerto, franck violin sonata
there are too many names for me to list so I just stopped there lmfao
David you want to be roommates ?
Only if you don't want to pay more
you gotta sleep though
Just sleeping, and as long as my roommate sleeps at the same time, I don't care if I have a roommate
Once Zoom University comes to an end, there will be no reason to spend any waking hours in your room
but what if I prefer studying in my room
Rooms are too cramped, just go to the lobby of the house to study
what if people are there tho
Commotion though
You never know what can happen on your way back to your dorm late at night
Not at CWRU though
I don’t think so?
not yet :0
Not bad, considering we didn't know what we were doing
Although we kinda missed 2 points on a stupid mistake
I could've sworn I included whose data we used but I guess not
On behalf of Zhanda, I'm sorry
@nobelium19 u literally missed the other person
I'm gonna get back working on homework, as you should :eyes2:
Not like I have an exam for soc on Monday
@nobelium19 how hard are Hurwitz’s exam?
Fair
wrong thing selected
I took notes too but still nervous lol
Well the exams are 30% and everything else is basically a guaranteed 100 if you actually do the work so
Simple math
Because it’s easy to get lost in her class
So rip
@nobelium19 are we supposed to compare two different blood samples? Like old sheep vs. new sheep?
I don't think that's the subject of the experiment, although you *can* use multiple samples
@toomanyzs let me suck your blood 🧛
But I'm still confused because the data is literally just figures and tables
So am I supposed to just copy them over?
Easy for me but doesn't sound right
Well what else am I supposed to do?
I mean I can reformat the tables but they'll still have the same information
I don’t know to be honest
want
Bruh I wish we could just do molecular weight as well
But someone already did the stuff for electrolytes vs nonelectrolytes
Yeah but someone did the experimental design for Experiment II
So I'm kinda stuck with just doing Experiment II
I don't really want to be that guy but I'm utterly confused over here
O damn
I tried it yesterday and I had to stop after like 20 seconds of using it
Bc my eyes were burning hotter than california wildfires
and even that is far too painful
og role hard to see
u can do it w/ java, but sometimes it dont like it
sorry smol brain
lol fuck i just noticed i missed a physics pre-lab quiz
ope rip
so a single quiz won't affect it much
I almost broke my tooth there
rip
zucchini stem aint food
so it aint good
they cant turn u down
Need for Speeed
@_frostyyyyy_ I just happened to pass by the general channel when I opened discord haha
UH- University Hospital
can i research my bed, I can get tons of work time in, just shut the door and turn out the lights
~~we need to drop our iolab devices~~
werent u supposed 2b sleeping?
i never said im sleeping-?
except
Not bad tho
what is wrong with that :cutethonk:
u can't play long notes >:)
also wind instruments don't have as many rep as y'all do
pls make it longer than a bar
i don't have a brain for it to be empty
go sleep then :eyes2:
The next two weeks are going to be hell for me so I'm only going to average 6.5 to 7 hours but it should get better before April
I have so much I need to do in the next two weeks
I'm doing homework right now, unfortunately I'm stuck in a time crunch until late March and I will only be able to get 6.5-7 hours of sleep a night during that time
I should be able to get 8 hours during April-May though
i sleep that without alarm
Without an alarm, I sleep 8 hours
i only sleep 8 hours if im ded drunk
or physically exhausted
I only sleep for 5-6 hours
I always feel so exhausted at the end of the day... I will suddenly feel tired and then just collapse onto the bed
I don't even have a choice
but u are waking up kinda late then if u still up and sleep 6 hours
I don't have insomnia, if anything, I have the issue where I just fall asleep when I don't want to
i go this late just weekends
don't wanna start a war
i know i mentioned before but i think u didnt see it
I have never seen you before clement
yo why he dont have airpods tho
my other pair of headphones broke, so that was my spare
o shit bet
ehhhhh idk if i look like matt damn
Matt Damn
Math damn
close enough
damn the o didnt register lmaoooo
I hate that movie
Fuck i was about to
idk what that means
idk man
i dont acknowledge the existence of any other continents
https://melmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ohio_meme.jpg we shouldn't acknowledge the existence of any other states
I never played Age of Empires 😔
@quintus_fabius_ I don't understand all of those emojis you used to react
Shame?
Oh, now I get it
@chandachan I'm gonna try and tag u all day long to find out when u sleep
Don't drop out of college please
go to trade school
The sad part is supposed to be that many BME people have to quit their dream major because it's too hard
from a trade school????
Oh I thought college in general lol
I didn't read
Is that a trade school ?
i dont believe in you
dont choose your major based on median starting salary
Petroleum engineering tops the lists of college majors by salaries but I never even considered doing it
All I'm trying to say is that if you do have to switch from BME to business major, you will still be okay financially
whats the difference between a 50k starting salary and 90k starting salary
"My mom told me if u want to be priest you must become the pope,  I decided to be a pinter and I became Picazzo"
I agree, as far as inknow people in the states can survive without a major or just community College degree
It's easy to say "money doesn't matter" but it does matter if you want to have a family later
starting salary isnt a good statistic to gauge that
I don't want to work like 80 hours a week
"Enjoy your work and you will never work in your life"
What if you want to have a life outside of work?
The meaning is that if you enjoy your work then u would be so passionate u don't see it as a job
No need for tensions
Understandable tho
i didn't know you are pashtun
damn bruh you need to visit the cleveland museum of art or some shit
Why tho
Freaking spy
What does the hug emoji mean?
He's asking about Pakistan a lot cause he was sent by xi jinping to make sure the silk route won't be blocked in pakistan
Now I'm gonna be captured mossad style and land in freaking "reformation camp"
What class
is it monday ?
But I didn't get any announcements from the si girls
@chandachan rober needs you
@chandachan be a woke young man
oh lala?
U woke up too late
Time to do some homework
@chandachan no confidence motion was passed again Imran Khan
Bye jenin
i didnt have him personally but a lot of friends did
@mgster didnt have him
I suck at it
Y’all don’t study
since we last talked
don't u dare offend her
what happened here
idk
Couldn’t be me
raunka u suck
Jenin study
both of you study
ur not studying either raunak
i can see u not studying
i lied sorry
y'all need to chill
raunak i hate you ❤️
Jenin pls take your laptop away
And let us study
your laptop simps for you?
raunak sucks
0 brains left
4 phone calls made
How is it even possible to do 1750 flashcards in one day? Wouldn't that take hours to review?
They're mostly short though
@chandachan  I've been up for some time but forgot to wake u  up
@chandachan your friends want you
@chandachan wake up it’s time for school
@chandachan you're gonna miss the bus
@chandachan now go sleep, classes are recorded
I’m more nervous for my sociology exam than I was for my chem exam. The irony
That shouldn't be possible
Find out where does your professor lies on the political, economical spectrum and u can secure an A
Shame that many humanities/social sciences are like that
That's why I like the classes I'm taking, my grade doesn't depend on how much my professor agrees with some random political opinion I have
u dont have to agree with them, just dont let them know you dont
still the weekend on the monday, must b nice
True, I haven't taken language courses in college but those seem more naturally inclined to very objective and fair grading
Math is DEFINITELY not the same as engineering
Math comes under sciences
it's already dying without me doing that dw
there's nothing wrong with being rude to a virus
until we see leprechaun babs, st paddys day hasnt happened yet
getting a keg happening this week tho. exams ffs
I just tasted the worst pasta sauce to ever exist
Nope
AHHHHH ITS SO BAD
@raunakwastaken u didn't cook in sages !
ye, u dont need to change ur disc username
y would there need to b one
Cdc says that fully vaccinated people can be normal 2 weeks post shot, do not have to quarantine after exposure, and also can skip testing. Wonder how this will impact university policy without causing a vaccine-related caste system
ppl are sketched out by bill gates' vaccines cuz of his population control agenda, and cuz of reports that his vaccines fucked up thousands of kids in india
elon musk makes shit work by making himself a meme
Unfortunately true
dont u kno vaccines cause autism?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!11!!?!?!?!
think logically here: if someone says that they want the world population to go down, then it wouldn't be unreasonable to be wary that the shit that they give u is gonna kill u or fuck up ur kids
Imma download more RAM for my phone
ay its no longer mask mandates cuz that shit doesn't work
if u can't breathe u can't spread covid
Found an article that says that the Indian government determined that the vaccines were not the cause of death https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-gates-india/false-claim-bill-gates-faces-trial-in-india-for-testing-vaccines-on-children-idUSKBN22V27F
wait zach so i dont have to get tested anymore???
Unfortunately not. I had a friend ask that question and UNIVERSITY policy is that everyone gets it anyway
but cdc seriosuly says u dont have to quarantine?
oh
Whose death?
Some children in India died and some people blamed it on Bill Gates and his vaccines but the government found that it was because of other things
yes the internet never lies
If I'm not wrong (I might) it was the vaccine for papiloma, or some kind of vaccine only for a disease in girls
Where did you read it? Don't trust just anything you read on the Internet
And tbh it can be misinterpreted but it just seems that for westerns  birth control for poor African women sounds like eugenics, yet women in western civilization see  birth control for themselves as a benefit soo....
someone doesnt want to b sponsored by the bill and milenda gates foundation :P
Population will eventually plateau regardless of what any particular person wants... as countries develop further, fertility rate drops
Cuz then the population is not self sustainable, which will cause huge economic problems down the road
Missing the big picture makes one liable to unintended consequences
Ofc but I guess there are many branches to their problem he does something on one of the branches
our grid can easily get taken down if someone wanted to fw us
I was applying to work on some research this summer and one of the projects is about improving security for electricity grids
That's why u can drive fast in germany, cuz the Autobahn is well maintained, and getting a license requires a lot more training over there
literally anyone's grid can be taken out in the blink of an eye
wtf its 60
With hella energy shit can be recycled better
Hard to make it cheaper in some places
cuz separating and extracting materials from waste takes a bunch of energy, and currently, only a few things can rly be recycled
There's going to be a lot of problems caused by the shift in the average age
In poorer areas, families need more children so that they can take care of household shit, so instituting methods of population control will make shit fall apart there cuz the societal infrastructure isn't there yet
It seems what I read before was wrong and more recent news have updated that info @_frostyyyyy_ is right that there was no convincing evidence on girls having problems from hpv vaccines
cuz there's not enough ppl paying into it
Just print more money duh
I'd say that's more a wrong solution to a problem they didn't see coming
Improving the infrastructure will make it so that families won't need to have many children, thus the population will self regulate
This is the current policy, but it's unclear if this will work forever
It doesn't work
Interest rates are low right now though
Under a savage capitalist system the more money you print the more money is stored in rich people's vaulta
From the Congressional Budget Office:
Tax breaks for large corporations cause ether were "severely affected by covid"
Yeah that's a load of shit
except that that's a global issue
Can u explain a bit what it means I dont think I understand
Still don't get what's the point then, sorry I didn't get as far in econ
when you give a billionaire a tax break they spend it on a vacation to Cancun. They don't re-invest it
They might use the shit that they get from their tax break to buy some waterfront properties tho
Doesn't like immigrants yet prefers foreign city, curious.
If we keep printing money, then foreign backers of our debt may lose faith in our ability to pay it back
I'm not sure yet, but we're going to have a lot of debt just from Medicare and Social Security alone
in the short term that might work, but in the long term the dollar becomes worthless
if money printer keeps going brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
that ain't the issue and its just a scapegoat
haha that's basically how shit went for those huge companies like the airlines when they got bailed out
Austerity doesn't poll well so politicians can't actually reduce deficits (all of them claim they want to, but they never do) which is why we're accumulating so much debt
Finally, sad I didn’t get an rsvp 🤬
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the working class that tax cuts for the rich are beneficial to them
Not yet, I think revolution has sun problems but that's for another day
I mean revolution is hard
That cough isn’t ironic enough, sorry 😤
Wow I’m leaving now
I was gonna say sorry I have Covid but thought y’all would take it seriously
death been flirting with you for a decade brother let it go
Wasn’t he admitted to hospital recently
The royal family is worried about Archie’s skin color when this dude is purple
They just don’t die like they used to 💔
He’ll be 100 this year
Wtf
he's worried if the baby will "look black" when he has literal black circles around his eye lmfao
Well it was under British rule until 1947 which wasn't that long ago
Nigeria was under British rule til 1960
The monarch is so freaking petty
Is Elizabeth jr the still living one?
Elizabeth II is the current Queen of the UK
I ain’t gonna courtesy in front of the Queen
after 3
have had office hours smh
Same monarchy shit
Queen was a monarchy shit before it was a chess move
Yes but the title doesn’t have queen in it so you can’t confuse the 2 lol
1947 wasn't that long ago, a lot of people alive right now were alive in 1947
I thought they didn’t have any real power
I can’t math
My grandpa had apparently seen gandhi
Mhatma Ghandi don't be a pedophile challenge
Even Elizabeth II isn’t pretty
Did the math and my gramps was alive in 1947
Because they’re annoying
so, they fell into the attention whores' traps
They have less upfront drama tho
the last of the habsburgs
Clement I hope your gf isn’t related to you by blood
u really want to be bullied, don't you
is fucking grubhub not working for any of y'all
being fair, florida seems more wild than it is because it actually releases all arrest records as public 

no other state does that
I'm hungry and unable to use fucking fuckhub
I have not tried fucking grubhub so cannot clarify
Gotta go thru grubhubs front hole not back
Feels bad man
that shit helps a lot
Don't u hate it when fuckhub doesn't worm
Work
i generally don't use shit like that
U don’t have snacks in ur room?
Who sees ads anymore
Trust me, it's so bad that you shouldn't see it
Looked at thumbnail and no I’m not dumb enough to click
Howdy you're not allowed to fix any other technical problems until this campus can go 20 mins without a god damn wepa breaking
btw I unfortunately did not get falafel cafe
they were closed sunday
If only the wepa's werent shit
So apparently some people on campus haven't taken a shower once this semester
wtf
Well it's not definitive but Adam said that some people on campus have such bad hygiene that he wouldn't be surprised if they didn't shower
sorry what david
Lotta reasons, and also a lotta ways to get clean without showering tho most of the time it isn’t as effective
@_frostyyyyy_ as per howdys suggestion to move out of quotes, please know you may be severely disappointed with what people do in the bathrooms on campus
Yikes. I can't even imagine how bad it could get
fr tho
last semester, people were not this disgusting
Because I’d rather find them than the pubes...
at least it was not so bad that people have to point it out on groupme
during the summer i feel disgusting if i don't shower like twice a day lmao
I feel disgusted if I go a day without showering
i don't understand how those neckbeards can get away with not showering for a week
let alone the whole damn term
bRUH WTF
Hint *they dont use *deoderant
As a girl I can’t imagine going more than 3 days without washing my hair
wtf is shower spinach lmaooooo
I used to wash it once a week
But realized I should do twice
how bad is such bad hygiene?
I'm not sure, I'm just repeating what I've heard other people say and I've heard that hygiene can be really bad
If you have bad hygiene stay away from me and I mean that in the nicest way possible
outrageous shit makes u wanna know more
U never have to wash ur hair if you dont have any
But Bc of the cold weather I’m doing 2-3 week twists anyway 😔
I understand if ur poor if u cannot shower but fam you live right next to a shower which you don't have to pay for directly there are zero excuses
I know a dude who forgot to drink water and was sent to UH
Forgot 😭😭
Its cuz you either HYDRATE or you DYDRATE
My most common cause of headache is dehydration headache
its cuz u need water
i got 12bottles on standby for insta hydration if need b
never kno when hydration will strike
Guys I don’t know why I need to keep repeating myself: just because YOU make good hygienic choices doesn’t mean that OTHERS make good hygienic choices
Don’t be surprised when you see idiots here
Cwru after hours
I bet it was a premed, they were so upset that they couldn't shadow in a hospital that they made their own scenario
bro many people can't say they got into the cleveland clinic SOM as a college freshman...
End of discussion
that intern didn't tweet that by themselves lol
"I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm simply here to apologize. So what we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned, and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react, or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't, and for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the Internet.

what a terrible "apology"
we're talking about it tho
It doesn’t even show the thread
it doesnt need to make u want to go to burger king
It’s really wrong
They needed to realize that people don't read everything except the first words
I get their message but the execution was so bad
I also dislike Burger King due to their limited variety of vegetarian options
something tells me they arent considering veggies
Afaik, they don’t have any veg burgers
If you're looking for fast food for vegetable options I'm afraid you won't find anything my friend
but dont think for 1 second
On a pure economical level, even if Burger King was misogynistic, it isn't in their best interest to alienate 50% of their clientele
y'now Howdy I wouldn't mind if big corps get tax write offs helping people get jobs they wouldn't get without that tax write off
Wendy's tweets are top notch but their practices aren't
Popeye's ain't bad
I’ve never had chick fill a or arby
arby's is awful
I rarely eat fast food anymore
What the fuck is that
is there palestinian food near us
oh

I haven’t even watched today’s lecture
bruh I don't even understand the pressure shit from last week
sorry raunak
The beef limit doesn't apply to me because I am not Hindu
Nope
meanwhile im scared of karma to the point where it dictates my life
Isn’t that non veg?
isnt there some shwarma place on euclid
My dad is Hindu but occasionally eats beef if my brother doesn't eat his stake
@raunakwastaken you're right, Reddit karma does dictate your life. You are right to be scared
there was chili in my burrito the other day when I TOLD THEM NO CHILI AND I STILL BIT INTO CHILI
Y'know I thought about editing that message but I'm leaving it
isnt chili a type of veggie tho
how are veggies bad
unless u cant handle spice
are you serious rn
chili isn't made with just peppers............................
oh, meat stew?
raunak ur missing out 😔
I HAD TO THROW MY BURRITO OUT THE OTHER NIGHT CUZ THEY PUT CHILI IN MY BURRITO WHEN I TOLD THEM NOT TOOOOO :cz_sob:
You dont like chilli?
howdy are you serious rn
wasting food is worse than not liking it
oh burgerIM's impossible burger is basically impossible cuz it's vegan
I've been avoiding beef lately because of the environmental impact
it's awful
Bad
pork is pretty bad too but I don't eat it often, but I do eat it occasionally since there aren't many alternatives to pork on the market
the burrito has still been touched by the beef/pork which is against her religion? Are you guys being intentionally dense?
can we get rid of slow mode here now @howdy_.
the libtard media big tech tried to censor us
dont u dare
They don't pay their workers slave wages and still are affordable and have workers
Bc it’s already wasted
Smh imagine leaving ur room
I’m working on it
not anymore
WANT
holy shit
Howdy even cut off his hair to hide his real alibi
ZACK IT JUST OCCURED TO THE LAB IS DUE THIS WEEK
dont yall have an exam too
like i knew but i forgot
this week is gonna be hell for me lmfao and I barely did anything today
like it was in my head but i forgot
but of course we have one due the day of the first exam
the lab and class professors dont coordinate at all
they probably dont even speak to each other
I have two tests friday and a lab due :blobcry:
I wish I was joking!
arent you not allowed that?
And studying is not option
who studies when bored????
I have math quiz tomorrow, EMAC HW wednesday, emac test friday, lab firday, physics exam friday, and emac paper due friday (I have rough draft done tho) 

I wanna fucking die

im gonna fuck off and re watch the lecture
a car w/ a spare tire?
It's important in math
math weird
lol thats wrong
reject math
squares have nothing to do with circles
Cant have a jeep without squares AND circles
what about triangles tho?
is it bad that anytime I see a white dude in a big ass pickup truck I automatically assume they have a micropenis and a Klan robe in the closet
Pizza is round comes in square box and you cut in triangles
U need to become a mathematician
Just hungry people
coal rolling aint good
Smh just get a black fog machine and tape it to the car
Gotta fuck up the car for peak manliness
somehow this is tho

Unpatterned truck nuts how sad
How sad u gotta b for plain white truck nuts

How did the sociology exam go
bro i've not even gotten out of my room today wdym anjali
@kaori_flute do you want to sneak out together to a rave 🥺

isn't my hand enough zack? :(
This song goes sooooooo hard lmfaooooo
sorry
@everyone wake up it’s time for school
People were awake at 5 AM? 👀
Reminder of the effects of sleep deprivation:
If you continue to operate without enough sleep, you may see more long-term and serious health problems. Some of the most serious potential problems associated with chronic sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Other potential problems include obesity, depression, impairment in immunity and lower sex drive.
Bruh you were up at 3am last night
I agree with you, but you can't say that when you went to sleep at 3am last night smh
I went to sleep before 3:14
@raunakwastaken  :hug1:
:hug1:
I don’t take chemistry anymore sorry <3
Most important part of the article:
> The overall course grades for students averaging six and a half hours of sleep were down 50 percent from other students who averaged just one hour more sleep. Similarly, those who had just a half-hour more night-to-night variation in their total sleep time had grades that dropped 45 percent below others with less variation. This is huge!
Does this work on 300 level Chemistry classes
People get more than 8 hours of sleep?
Well, in that study, the person who got the highest score in the class also got the most sleep
9 hours
how much did these people study
The participants are MIT students who I'm going to guess that they study a lot
Well it isn't an MIT class if almost nobody isn't getting a >90
EDIT: English sucks
took u so many edits to edit 😔
MIT doesn't have grade inflation so the average GPA there is similar to Case's
The class is intro to solid state chemistry so it isn't actual gen chem I believe
This study has a LOT of issues with lurking variables
I don't know what the equivalent of that would be over here
Probably 145? idk
wanna go thru undergrad admission process again?
Nope
Couldn't justify it
There are people who left Carnegie Mellon for case
There are people who left Ivies for case
Just because of money
And I don’t blame them
Left? You mean transferred? Or just turned down for freshman admission?
Didn't realize Vandy was that low acceptance rate
MIT isn't big on premed I think... it's an engineering school
It’s crazy hard to get in
They are so competitive, and the residential culture is a super hard "party cuz we are stressed" thing and a LOT of people there have drug and alcohol problems
My friend isn’t enjoying it though I heard
If only MIT had a med school
MIT will forever be a dream school :uwu:
Fair
*and then it got cancelled due to covid*
I'm sad I didn't get to visit Olin
Idk what I was on at the time
Not for me I’m very slow
I wouldn’t have been able to keep up
You're an extremely bright person and your class schedule is very full... don't underestimate yourself
I’ve heard pre meds get into really prestigious med schools so I’m not upset by being here
who wants to cuckoo
Did they apply to med school this year or are they taking a gap year for that program?
an hour away from discord byebyee
Tbh idk why I’m double majoring and minoring like I know I’m slow but I have so many interests AHHHHH
Bruh imagine studying at Harvard AND MIT
Studying CS and medicine at Harvard and MIT is 🧠
Anyway guys I still haven’t looked for research ok I’m going back to work
How can someone be so academically accomplished?
nobel go study 🔫
The Chancellor of Austria is very young (born in 1986) but he dropped out of college
I didn’t. But a lot of people who come to us usually apply here too
ooo 
I did not apply either. Most of my class stayed in palestine
I got accepted in the best two colleges in Colombia but I was 16 and didnt want to go just yet
I thought you went to school in Texas
My bad
5 years is a long time. Here, 5 years is if you want to do a BS/MS program
We also have to start studying otherwise u can get drafted for a year of military service
Here is "mandatory" u could either study, be single child or pay proportionately with several aspect to not go
You gotta get accepted in the program too tho
Oh
Yeah u need some reqs
Not for phd unless u have a rly bad Gpa if say
Ok back to work
I would like to work in designing software but one reason I want to get a master's degree is so that I can become a specialized developer like a Machine Learning Engineer
In grad school
I've heard that most AI jobs need a master's degree minimum and a PhD is preferred
So if u take credits beyond that it doesn't count?
One field I'm considering for graduate school is Operations Research
Seems interesting to me (applied mathematics for optimization) and I didn't do it in undergrad because it's too specific and not many schools have it
Dad will beat me if I don’t
Oh. Depends on my father
My parents would just *sigh* in disappointment and move on
Study hard in school. That is a good thing to do
I mean I’ll do whatever he wants me to do. He allowed me to choose my bachelors but I don’t think he will  for masters lol
Everyone I know is rooting for me so I can't fail or else I would disappoint them
I'm also interested in many things  like @sprinkles2108 , I might look at someone with a restaurant and could see how that seems like a fun job
Only my brothers, my mom and some cousins have gone to university lol can't imagine the pressure
I don’t have pressure, I just have encouragement if you know what I mean
True tho
Tbf the plastic that can’t be recycled anymore ends up in the landfill
U can make very strong columns by melting ugly, hard and old plastic
Plastic is pretty bad for your health
I ain’t no scientist but my guess is this can lead to cancer
It’s a guess
Heated plastic in general = BAD
cuz it will kill you in 40yrs, vs 40min
I want to throw out my microwave
Music in study vc sounds pretty bad dunno why
honey what the fuck am I supposed to eat then
air
All those vegans out there on killing spree of lettuces
there aint any ez class
Well, I'm talking about the ordinal easiness instead of cardinal easiness. Of course any college class is still harder than most high school classes
The fluids problems were the hardest in Calc 2 in my opinion
so I'll probably get a point or two taken off oh well
I bet I would get it wrong though
I'm thinking of taking MATH 224 (Differential Equations) because I've heard that it's easy
Um I don't think it will be easy but
Also, if I want to do a secondary major in math, then diff eq is a requirement
Zack I don’t have that
Negative tho
Oh ninja edit
You’re left with negative 25
you forgot to plug in the exponent part rip
My life is sad
1 is the only one you missed so at worst you'll get a 90
He has a 1.9 rating and Guo dropped his class
lol hurley looked kinda sad bc no one had cameras on
math professor
Professor for MATH 228 Differential Equations
Oh
Too late
don't die
whatsapp isnt v popular inside america
its very popular outside tho
@quintus_fabius_ don’t be shy send me memes too
Omg
And it’s not even summer yet
I ran out and now I'm hungry
I have a shit ton of work. Imma cry
Haven’t started yet
If u catch the target shuttle, ik whole foods has frezh cut salami
It spensive tho
Doesn't Plum Market open this week?
From what i saw when i was in there, i didnt see a deli section, however its possible they have a packaged meats section
you all need hugs
HUG SESSIOn
@sprinkles2108 ngl if i was paid 115k a year just to hand out glasses I'd do the job
Honestly same though
But med school would let me explore other specialties though
lol no way 🙃
Respect for you guys tho
Way too much math......🙃
Math makes my brain overheat
went overtime in flute class and my food is in a closed leutner :')
*seriously tho, 8pm close smh*
why does it close at 8 tho
is it cause of the pandemic?
I'm taking two math classes this semester and it's really not bad at all but I'm worried that I'm not going to do well in future classes
I feel like I'm learning more from the math classes than most other classes so I actually kinda enjoy taking them
in math?
It's only 9 credit hours out of the way though so I'm considering it
Canvas: your soc exam is graded!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Also canvas: SIKE the prof is still grading it
You had to submit 676 words of an essay for an exam?
I already lost 2 points on the multiple choice too
Uhhh we had to write 3 paragraphs but she wanted a lot of “rich” details
omg 98 im sorry priyanka i hope you can get into med school
Ikr IM SO SCARED
I DONT THINK I HAVE A SHOT AT MED SCHOOL

@ansh8867 do you think she will get into med school?
ansh she lost 2 points what will happen
@ansh8867 fam I lost 2 points now I’m not going to med school I’m so screwed
Turn every definition from your sociology class into an Anki card. I guarantee you will remember everything
Sadly for me, I'm in a lot of classes where the stuff I have to remember can't fit on a flashcard
I haven’t used anki at all
I don’t really use flash cards
@ansh8867 priyanka wants to go to the museum with you. will you go with her in august?
do u want me to get you food from bibibop
jenin how do you feel so many people simp for you?
Nothing beats this
Raunak go a day without calling someone a simp challenge
Oh
*challenge gone wrong*
Jenin we gonna work on da lab tmmrw?
now that she lost 2 points
-8ball wil priyanka go to med school
-8ball Will I go into med school?
8ball giving sad reality
IM DYING
-8ball Did I fail my ENGR 145 Exam 1
-8ball Will I fail Data Structures?
-8ball did jenin do her physics homework?
That's a lie tho hence 8 ball doesn't say the truth
Not possible bro. You need 100 in every exam
-8ball Will I end up with a BME degree
-8ball Will I end up with a BME degree
-8ball Will I get into med school
-8ball should I even bother trying premed? I don't want to be a business major eventually 🙃

damn
the bot really dont like foor
sigh
-8ball Will Sam kill me for not having started on the lab yet

-8ball Will hostile AI kill us all?
-8ball will corona ever go away
Discrete math for you son
You're taking Discrete Math?
Did you take Discrete Math in high school?
-8ball will I survive college
-8ball will I survive Math
Discrete Math is very useful if you want to write computer programs
-8ball will Priyanka get into medical school
-8ball Will Priyanka go to med school?
-8ball should I even bother trying for med school
RIP
Ty but I’m really not😭😭
Bro I wish lol
I finished the CCEL work
Idk tbh
I don't remember how long it took
I guess I’ll be up late tn
But oh whale
I’m sure it’s not bad
Im just struggling because I’m behind
Because it's due in 24 hours?
I think my computer is about to go kaputt
Running Java and Python while doing other work is probably not the move
Just attached QED to the end of one of my linear algebra homework answers 😎
both of u need sleep :smiling_gun:
fuckin hell that would be wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much of a clusterfuck for me to handle lmfaoooooo
it sounds worse than it is
eh i just dont like having a clusterfuck of shit in front of me
I have closed it lol
don't forget to press alt f4 whenever u lost ur train of thought
press alt f4 whenever you want your computer to compute faster
tilt ur computer screen sideways to get shit to download faster lul
all blonde women, and some of them strive for power and/or money
i don't even use it so it's a non issue for me the kinda bullshit they got
@.fim. I know ur still awake
Bruh my iOLab died on me and it's only Lab 3
Bruh batteries are dead
oh yeah that happens a lot, sorry to hear that
isnt it just double A's?
and that affects their ability to accurately collect data because in all betteries voltage decreases as they lose juice, and a stable voltage is needed for insturmentation stuff
I actually wasn’t; I’m genuinely  improving my schedule now
Just work up 10:30 with ~8 hours of sleep 💪
I fell asleep at 3am
Ahh. I still have to finish my lab report. Lol it's due today
And I have to do math questions
theres a good version and a bad version
which is so stupid
it would be nice to have on a pad instead of a laptop, for annotation and whatnot
theres probs an apple port, i gaurentee it doesnt run well
since apple will sabotage competition
Oh
Why upload it to one notes?
NEVER BUY SURFACE
those things are shit
have you ever tried replacing ram on that thing
terrible to maintain
like wtf is that shit
The one thing they dont skimp out on is the frame and the screen
i got one for "christmas" last semester as a surprise
I have a Wacom drawing tablet but it's hard to use because I can't see the tablet while I'm drawing on it
and i'm gonna purchase a new laptop before i go to campus *i think*
does he use the kind with or without the screen
I use one without screen
My Wacom tablet doesn't have a screen and it feels weird to use as a result
M2 is gonna be sick
idk if i should buy a new one since my current one works just fine BUT my dad wants my laptop for his personal use so there's that excuse ig
It shouldnt
i may just have my dad buy himself a new laptop
cuz i feel bad for having him use a hand-me-down lol
I'm so behind on hardware... I'm still using a Samsung Galaxy S8
i think i'm gonna get the iphone coming out this fall
yeah my iphone rn is from 2018
unless you have a deal with your carrier to trade in your phone for a new one every year. those deals are rare tho
You could save money by just buying a cheaper phone plan though, MVNOs use the same networks and are a lot cheaper
honestly if your iphone still has a home button it's high-time you upgrade
any ISP is bad
any Large ISP is bad
Oh, I don't use my phone plan very much so I just buy a cheap phone plan from an MVNO (who uses the AT&T network)
you can buy pay-as-you-go plans
at&t sucks
They don’t
If price wasn't a factor I would go with Verizon but TMobile will do just fine for now
if that doesnt scream Evil Overlords, I dont know what does
who wants to attack at&t tho LOL
they need to protect their goodies from the common man
so they can rip them off further
oh yeahhh
TA lab hours start at 1pm
Sarah answered my email so I'm not confused anymore
I'm a bit peeved that we got pushed back a week and super stressed about my Friday exam ;-; but this is good news to help out the week
oh no :( best of luck for your exam tho!
good that you told me now i won't bother your for lab 4
why didn't you say so i wouldn't have dm'ed you ugh
oh really?
idk I charge them though haha
@bravo5127 do you want me to spam your email?
its a fair deal
hope they get actual takis tho
i didnt see any last i was in
naturally, nothing we can get is worth 17$ of food, but i feel sushi def on the super small end of it
tho looking at plum, they charge real money to get cheese on ur meal swipe burger
Sounds like a bad deal... I could eat at restaurants and pay for each individual meal and it would be cheaper
u cant go to school here
i was refering to off campus tho
Oh
Arent apartments a lottery system
Smh my parents won’t let me live off campus
Howdy, you don’t know Indian parents man
Cant act on it though
Yeah try saying that to a tired Indian dad who just came home from work
unless we're still remote at that point
recently in the last few weeks hate crime on asian americans has spiked
Nobel they hate us Asians 😔
Maybe because I'm on campus, I didn't really notice it 😂
and there was already Asian hate when COVID began, but it's gotten worse
Nobel dw I don’t hate you
two on-campus cwru girls faced asian hate
off campus tho
if anyone spits out asian hate i will simply wish you nightmares
if anyone hates on any minority groups in general i will lose all respect for you !
fr tho i think so too
@ansh8867 do you hate Asians?
i wonder what draws many asians to cwru. this isn't hate or anything. im just genuinely curious
@joyous do you hate Asians?
@joyous can I come to America without a visa?
he doesn't have to know
im trying to help people 😤
A large portion of the international students (who are 14 percent of the students) are Asian and aren't counted in that number
sorry
All this hate
Wow I turn away from Discord for 1 minute to ACTUALLY DO WORK and this is what happens
I don't even know what it means
You don’t??
Seriously?
Bruh I just realized
@toomanyzs you saw nothing
Why am I wasting time on here instead of studying?
Coz studying is for chomu's
but im inside studying for math like a 🤡
Studying for math is really good, it's not clownish
i hate doing it tho
Which math class are you in?
there are many big brain math classes tho
but it seems to have settled
best guess would b go when ppl are in class
Which major tho lol
i havent had the mediterranean bowl yet, is it any good?
Isn't Plum Market in the building of the old grocery store that shut down due to corona on Euclid?
I have gone into Constantinos exactly twice: once for cheese and once just before my interview for Case buying I don't even know what
I havent looked into it tbh
It doesn't even have a wikipedia page lolmao
I don't know how that can be
I was hungry
my high school is right behind a Kroger. after school many people would go there to purchase sushi and sandwiches
well, the sushi at my kroger is in a cold open freezer-type thing
so it's already cold
we getting ripped off so hard
on a slow day we did the maths
and it ended up about 17 a swipe
I could buy a whole foods tenderloin for a few meal swipes and still have way more food
my chipotle is cheaper than a meal swipe goodbye
they wanted 50c for cheese on a meal swipe burger
so, they are a bigger rip off then most
I just realized that
slightly more rectangular tho
So yours is a boring Tetris piece
Except the walls are blue and I don't like blue
Probably still under the newer paint layers
I thought of adding that modification while the room was being painted but I didn't want to get in the way of the painters with a sudden change and I regret it
oh gotcha
the only weird thing about the mural was the cloud on the ceiling that looked like a skeleton dog riding a unicycle
hope u aint wearing blue
abba dee abba die?
It's still overpriced though, you could avoid ever having to spend much time cooking and still get average meal price down to half that (6 dollars per meal)
that shit could cure cancer and you'd have no idea, right?
ive left him speechless
no i was doing important shit
'important shit' 🙄🙄🙄🙄
and I didn't know being a wine connoisseur was genetic
but still lmao back home at a grocery store they sell veuve for like $45. $70 is waaaaay too much
its a college grocery store theyre gonna scam u wherever they can
was that a joke that flew over my head
I think a decimal inserted is close to realistic price
im having a hard time understanding these emojis
I sometimes get those but at Kroger they’re like $8? Idk
Lin Biao died in a plane crash in Mongolia
close enough
Plum market looks like Whole Foods
I’ve never set a foot in either
Idk
Cause if u can pay with swipes then it can’t rly be overpriced right
and guess what
if they dont have health options
they arent doing it right
That was a good exam man
Math 223
probably i dunno tho
ugh cucumber sushi is so good
~~ugh cucumber~~ sushi is so good
Sucks but
Or is she just trying to.maintain political power by siding with the ccp
Oh shit
Autonomy was never guaranteed not even in 1997 during the handover
... ~~sorry~~ :sadcat3:
I won't voice my many issues with it on main because they're of a sensitive nature
smells like rain, so make sure to have an umbrella or a poncho
cuz i dont have one
hewwoo. Don't ban her owo
wasnt it in the morning?
i will come to the airport to pick you up UwU

Alberto said that CWRU is getting rid of SAGES because employers told them that it's not useful enough
didnt happen
but it never happened
nobel gotta study for his midterms
I don't know why
david we dont need a reason to hug
our bio midterm grades were our exam 1 grades !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@zacharious  convinced me. Sadly, I can't be there today because I have other matters to attend to
computer emojis
When does leutner close?
I need a wellness day each week
@chandachan go sleep
still had to say it 😀
That's sad there is no spring break 😭
I remember getting an email about the wellness days but now I can't find it
Don't you take chem 145
i won't UwU
oh yes cuz one of them will be dedicated to chem
life is sad
Don't engineering majors need to take it tho 🙃
CS majors only need CHEM 111
cs majors had to take it till last year. now we take discrete math instead(i might be wrong tho)
@kaori_flute i forgot to pray today
may have spelled that wrong
oh
you can still pray to him
rip
I just realized that it's odd that engineers here don't need to take a chemistry lab class
time to study physics owo
omg gl
chem lab is a separate class
couldnt be me
I'm thinking of taking a physics class in the summer with an in-person lab
not taking summer classes tho
@raunakwastaken i hope u started studying
doing nothing is worthwhile
cuz i have
I was really glad I took a January class because I would have felt horrible if I went like 6 weeks without doing anything
also jenin i still have no idea how you did Q10
oh i wouldn't have felt bad LOL
even tho i still have a full schedule this semester
I don't know yet what I am going to do in the summer 😬
i guess?
Because professors don't want to spend time grading people's homework
why do many grade when computer go brrr
*i dont see an issue w/ that*
Oh, I thought I heard someone say that
I guess I heard wrong
nah no one said anything in the groupme about it yet so
Bruh, I'm looking at physics classes in the summer and the labs take like 8 hours a week
The lectures are 8.5 hours a week so it would be 16.5 hours a week in total
Uhhh wtf
5 weeks
How much is a class in summer
half the tuition cost so it's about $1k per credit hour
thats a rip
Was chem really that bad
Wish me luck for next year...
Which class
Really?
2nd years dont have roommates
but i dont think that many people go for clarke?
But case hasn't send the i 20 yet
2 months??
Cause emergency
Dunno man for them going abroad and spending a bunch of money and possibly spread more covid applies as emergency
I guess, haven't checked
I even had roommate assigned already for last fall, and room and all
it takes like 2 weeks for us
i dont think so
U need it for visa don't you
yea we need
but i had i20 last year
but i didnt end up going
Okay I'm 11 hours out from vax and my harm hurt like a binch
@toomanyzs sorry, you can write me up, my case network ID is zxc551
@kaori_flute you missed my ray chen practise sesh
it was _so_ terrible
@nobelium19 did you go to sleep
cuz
To be fair this is somebody outside of juniper playing oldies but goodies
thats how u get the bullhorn turned on u
its never too late to play flute
@kaori_flute  we have to replace :pog: with KomodoHype but still call it PogChamp because Twitch replaced Gootecks' face with KomodoHype for the PogChamp emote recently
oh no the emote is named wrong
oh no
that's spelled wrong too

Idk
Big brain, didn't notice that until I'm was halfway through and I was like "well too late to switch to it now"
But I got kinda worried that he didnt want that so i switched it to the convoluted approach😭

No, just married to anyone, not necessarily someone who went to the same college. This is based on tax data
my platform is i wont spam ur inbox with nonsense
you got into cwru omg christian 🙄
Idk what’s going on
Wait @_frostyyyyy_ isn't being married bad
just get married and don't have kids
Oh yes I haven’t been living in norton for a year already
ZHANDA I WANT FOOD TOO POR FAVOR
If nobody has any kids then humanity dies and I think that would be bad
zhanda im hungry as well
The South Korean government predicts that in 2047, almost half of the populace will be 64+ years old... if that happened in America, the government would go broke from Social Security and Medicare costs
The problem is that there's not going to be enough money to give to old people if there's not enough young people working and paying payroll taxes
i can live w every1 dying
problems r only problems if ur uptight
wts gonna happen is gonna happen
That means that either benefits get cut or taxes get raised on young people, neither of which are good
100% give no fuck
then theres nothing you need to do
always talking about who the the world needs to get better and face its problems instead of enjoying wts r in front of u
there will always be problems
every time i try to be optimistic things just go the other way so idc anymore
truly, we are born without consent in sense xD
What life? Do your parents not give you any freedom in what you choose to study?
Seems like a lot of people here hate life
imagine not getting jittery when you have an internal panic attack couldn't be me
I'm worried that I'm squandering my potential all the time and not working hard enough
Omg david you work so hard from what I have seen already
Probably want to do a PhD... not sure what in yet, maybe something like CS or operations research
and then what.. for what end?
wld it be so bad to live w.o one?
Try to become a professor and if that fails, go work as a scientist for a tech company
its boring if you know everything thats gonna happen
and its v v v v likely one or the other will happen
it won't come back
i think its not your "potential" you shld be so scared to be wasting
Man I didn't plan what I'm doing now 5 years ago
I haven't gone outside in days
if you dont ever achieve your goals at all
I'm not on campus though
I have almost never played ping pong
Can I play with you tho?
@nobelium19 studies day and night, I can't compare to him at all
nobel's work ethic is insane man
@nobelium19 i want your work ethic
You pull all-nighters all the time and still seem like the most energetic person I know
i haven't pulled any yet cuz i have given up
Was there a lot of stuff due or something?
It was approx 2 days before exam
Phys Exam right
It was due yesterday but I thought it was getting too close and I wanted a very good day's rest before physics exam
what is considered an all-nighter though
3 hours sleep?
under 3 hours tbh
Cause I can’t spend so much time on this. I need to study math. I’m very weak at limits
Zhanda and Ansh y’all can continue without me
why make breathing hard
I don’t wanna
Bruh if I keep getting pinged I won't get anything done today
I can't join tonight because I'm busy this weekend but I can do it next week
Nah I can’t rn
prone to lose
Do I need a Netflix account to open
No judge tho
if u want ninjas
My fam got disney cause my of my niece
I have never watched anime
Oh. Who all has Netflix?
whenever you want <3
Me llamo el conquistador (I still screw up my el/la till now lmao)
Wasn’t that Ansh?
I don't have Disney+. I only have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu
Not yet
That's a fuck ton
But u study lots tho u don't have time
I don't have HBO Max or Disney+ though
Bye jenin
bye raunak :dogping:
I don't have anytime to watch anything though because I'm so busy
Damn
I don't think I've watched any TV or movies in like a month
last week I watched the dollars trilogy
I haven't watched the dollars trilogy yet but I've heard they are good
idk why they don't get oscars
i had dollars on dvd when i was a kid but i didnt understand any of it
The dude got some problems about abuse or something
oh wow i forgot this song existed
lmao i just realized i never actually listened to this song
I haven't watched anything in a month because I decided that I needed to sacrifice something for the grades I want
last semester
but i tried to get my shit together
I don't plan to watch any anime in the future, I just never got it
Yooo really? Ghaltana is also bad ass
idk
i just hear these songs in parties or people playing them in cars to max volume
Lol same, I only watched short ones 20 episodes or so, also I dont like the fixations with minors and small girls like wtf man
that shit is sad
idk
i did not hate it a lot
so much lost potential
so many side characters that were super interesting in the exam arc and in the sasuke retrieval arc
and then they never got any development
they do Konohamaru dirty tho
yeah, more lost potential
it almost makes me sick
rip
rober i hate you
the song is now stuck in my head
it's so cringe though
Ok I'm done doing work for today!
It's fast but I'll do https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJndhJ-KDjM for @nobelium19 soon. Without the Sargam
I don't want to hear it
Don't loop me into this smh
Man, it gets so boring at times. Hate that feeling
go sleep
This is the first year in a while that I haven't been unaware of when dst is, and I won't be looking at the clock and thinking I'm in a time loop
as dont starve together
Hasn't started yet in Ohio
We're still an hour away
Oh my goodness
I don’t like the fact that deadlines are an hour early from now on
Bruh, I just realized that I'm going to have to change my sleeping schedule
So I have to start going to sleep an hour earlier
How does it affect you tho
One hour shouldn’t make a difference
ITS 1 AM AND IM NOT ASLEEP
Cause of my problems: Me
I didn't know about DST like a 🤡  and now I will suffer the consequences
oh no 10 am?
Don’t change the time
If I were president I’d end this made up crap rn
Y’all crying over one hour
Cause I have to change all my class timings manually
OH GOSH
DREW MEYER PICKED THE WORST WEEK TO HAVE OUR EXAM THEN
CUZ
ILL BE SO TIRED
THAT I CANT STUFY
OH CRAP HERE COMES MY 67
My online presence isn’t matching my irl presence
I’m screaming on discord but really I’m quiet and have a straight face rn
um not physically. That was for my brother and the teachers at catholic school
Imagine going to a catholic school couldn’t be me (almost was me though)
Catholic school is a cult
Mommy wanted me to go to a catholic school
Because she went to a catholic/convent school when she was younger
My mom prayed to Jesus in school too
for me it was bc it was the only decent school in my area
Oh
they don't fund the schools much there
Guys I’m an idiot why am I still up
Both are in Utah for school rn
Homework, reading books
I haven't had any free time in months
ME TOO SINCE HIGH SCHOOL
I MISS READING SM
I poured my heart out onto my soc discussion response about how I miss reading
i don't have much time to read anymore
I feel like courses have taken over my life for the last 5 months and I have not read many books during that time other than listening to audiobooks
I love reading and I miss it so much
One book I was reading that I haven't finished yet is "The Information" which is about the history of information. I would definitely recommend it
Couldn’t be me
Ugh corona just has to end 😢
I plan to come to campus during the fall at least
I haven't gone outside in days
I be alone most of the time
Ugh exactly
We actually don’t have that many cases
Ok America is slow we know that
And the mask mandate is gone
I don’t know what the situation is in Uttar Pradesh
Ugh yeah idk what the governor did that
I don’t trust myself
I could never run a state
I haven’t been to Texas BUT
Which is like how hard is  it to wear a mask
Sorry I like tasty food
Really?
So we don’t have to act AS fast
5 million per day in India isn't as fast as USA distribution when you consider how many people live in India
I’ll get vaccinated when I need to
USA has 1/4 as many people and is already doing 2.3 million vaccinations a day
Y’all were so quick are supporting Murica omg I can’t 😂😂
Bye!
@epi7844 can I come to Mexico without visa?
Idk bruh 😂
I haven’t traveled to many places in India it’s quite sad
@epi7844 i don’t have American visa. Can you help me cross the wall from Mexico?
I totally forgot that
I don’t know why
Stay mad 😎
Cause of you 😘
I didn’t really notice pollution at the time
EVEN THO
Omg I feel you.. it is humid in Kerala
IT WAS STILL TOO HOT
My mom’s town is close to Nepal
SO ITS COLD THERE TECHNICALLY
AND STILL
You saw nothing
@iamnotaclowniamtheentirecircus your eyes are small like mine
sorry
:Hug:
Nothing. Gn
If You’re racist to everyone, doesn’t that mean you’re treating them all equal and therefore aren’t racist?🧐
"Ironic" racism is still racism
I could never be vegetarian as a Mexican
I’m trying to become a vegetarian
I need veg food
It’s too hard almost impossible
My grandma called me a little bitch once because I wouldn’t help her kill a chicken
I don’t know shit about cooking lmaoo
Vegetarian biryani sucks
There's a scene in Dirty Harry where he said he hates everybody and then lists most well-known racial/ethnic slurs
I don't think I'm going to get married for quite a while
But I don't see why I wouldn't invite you 🫂
I don't think I'm going to get married 🥲 ~~for quite a while~~
You don't want to marry?
Fam I do but no ones gonna want me
Wrong, I don't think you'll have any issue finding someone
If need a harem for that time frame
It’s not pre-marital sex if you never get married 😎
technically ur not wrong
Isn’t it all pointless
:hug:
Then just die
sorry, i am not going to use it
sorry
I didn't, he made his message automatically do that
Oh
I didn’t hear anything
I didn’t hear it
I’m on my phone though
yeah if your phone is silenced it won't
My phone is silenced AND on DND😎😎😎
Don’t need my parents hearing my notifs😎
And I immediately closed my laptop
it do be cold
Oh ansh
Bro I don’t know anything about anime
I've never watched anime either
Idk bruh
you're missing out smh
Anime has some down bad people watching it
Thing is uwu on here doesn’t look like a face to me
Down bad people?
it's got good and bad people watching it
As in they’re down bad
Not tryna hate
If I die alone you can plan my funeral
FUCK
IM DEAD
Ugh I will be that cat or dog lady
No you won't
I just lost alm hour of fucking sleep
Decrease. We’re 9.5 hours behind you now instead of 10.5
@absence000 @kaori_flute after how much time do we have our math class?
If I died
This shit is confusing
They just don’t wanna
I guess since we're now -1 hour ahead of you I guess it's an hour earlier
30 and a half hours
This is some American crap then
Actually western crap
6 and a half hours
So yea I need to go back
So a mf could be waking up and getting it’s already 12pm
time sorta is tho
I hate social constructs let’s go back to monke
Social constructs are Lowkey the shit
I have tenet download so if anyone wants it lemme know
Ngl I didn’t understand the second half of this movie
I only understand like 80% of it though
I wanna rewatch interstellar SO BAD
I don’t remember
It was about time though
dont remember wrinkle in time
smh my head
I heard that the movie adaptation is horrible
extended cut only
I am so uncultured in movies it’s sad
My life is sad
80% of college students ^
No but like idk much about movies
I haven’t watched many
I’m very uncultured when it comes to American entertainment (except music)
@kaori_flute you haven’t watched LOTR?
Omg. We need to watch that before anime
I never seen Indiana Jones
I haven’t watched the hobbit either
Anyway, this shouldn’t be news
Even tho ever villain is Mexican
it's reallllllyyyyyy bad
You don’t know that
Many children in poorer countries work in sweatshops and don't get an education
Fair, but I’m struggling in other ways that I don’t wanna talk about. But point is, that shouldn’t invalidate my situation either
I used to, but college has taken up my entire life
We all go thru sum
At first I didn’t listen to them
Many people in the world don't get education or clean water
I feel like the only valid thing I can complain about is racism
awh RIP
Like money doesn’t solve everything
If you grow up in America, you get education, clean water, food, freedom, etc.
My house went a week with no electricity Bc of ancient power system 😎
Idk
I don't think people here are racist
But on the real tho
Wow so someone hates Indian Americans here
I didn’t expect there to be so many of them
Lol asians hate affirmative action
But don’t hate the player get the game
But it doesn’t mean you can just go up to someone and ask them if “you’re here cuz of AA”
I don’t want to spend the rest of my life waking up at 3 am in east End Houston to see someone stealing shit from my car
India doesn’t really have AA David
Oh
Oh yes I wasn’t a fan of that
My mom just realized why people keep guns at home
But I’ll still stay strapped
I would just never ever touch them unless I had to
Police doesnt do crap. They only act when a crime happens, and don’t help to prevent anything
But my ass was still calling them
So many people have died all because the police wouldn’t believe them when they went to them for help because their lives were in danger
And my sisters god mother was shot and left on the ground
Oh my gosh
Oh my
I’m so sorry to hear that
That is very unfortunate and sad
But for a year or two she had to shit from a tube
Especially a lot of people I know won’t go to the police
Bc they don’t want to get deported
Even tho it doesn’t work like that
I wasn’t either
And they’re never on time
THEY. SUCK. AT. TIMING
The dudes are never caught
They’re never on time here either. But we don’t have guns and shit. Just ban them all together so that no one has it
If u ban guns crazy people are still gonna find ways to obtain one
But people just acid and shit
Guns aren’t the only weapons though
The police gave us a phone number for the car case and they never called back
Idk man
Idk man but here we’ve reached the point that people WILL keep guns illegally if banned
Im getting one as soon as i feel I can responsibly own one
Like I don’t want a gun on me when I’m depressed
*not for long tho*
My mom lives alone with my younger siblings
```
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.```
Okay I need to sleep now. Gn
@everyone go sleep
Don't die of heart disease
No he just hates your voice
I didn’t wanna upset anyone
It’s normal for us to feel depressed an sad and shit regardless of income
I want to hear you grunt at veale
RIP 95% people who applied to MIT
I remember that there was an MIT alumni event in Houston on Pi Day last year
Im ass at math
Math is not memorization of pi digits
i love math but i hate memorizing
Math is that math question I got that literally told me to estimate the mass of the sun
I love memorizing but I hate math
My linear algebra professor makes us memorize literally everything except the definition of vector spaces
oh boi
imma memorize the steps to fall asleep
But I’m bad at math and shit
noo sleepy
I can’t
I’ve been trying to fix my sleep for a month now

it makes sense when you think about it but ugh so frustrating
oh ik one of the 5%, but i think they're going to the naval academy instead
I tried to learn java
Matlabs ok tho
That class has the highest attrition rate of any class here probably
But it was so HARD
it was very hard
and was not an intro class at all
its a weedout class
That’s sad man
It's a weed out class
weedingout kids left n right
I ain’t built for that
Also ig the environment helps me study
I couldn’t focus as well at home
What if I learn how to drive and then buy a car and house?

I don’t drink soda
Fuck that

Like almost never
I use the train to get from the airport to case
except when it comes to anything school related
How do I find happiness?

How do I fix my sleep cycle?

Caffeine has a half-life of 6 hours
I don't read self-help books

Sleep is the one thing that’s still giving me trouble

bad decision ngl
Duke University just issued a stay in place order after 180 students have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last week and another 200 are in quarantine because of possible exposure to COVID-19
Hopefully that doesn't happen for Case Western
Rip their basketball season
i want pie
I don’t think I’ve ever had a pie
People in India don't eat pie?
Nope
Yea I’m p sure I haven’t had it
Anticipating my doom due to midterms
There’s only 20 mins left for pi day for me
I can’t even cut bread. How shall I make pie
Okay, most people on this server don't know how to bake
When Julius Ceasar died, my mom rose from his ashes

Jun, she gets pissed like a 9 year old

NASA says that there are "about 365.25" days in a year
That's why aliens don't want to communicate
i find it hard to believe that they do that when doing calculations that use the orbit of the earth
well, we already passed the one yr aniversary
Focus on the coursework because all your exams are getting cancelled
idk how useful of advice "buckle up" is gonna be for ur old self
i've never been known to be useful
my fitness lvl didnt change at all
nothing = nothing
A year ago I was dating a girl but I didn't like going out with her as much I thought I would have more time to go out this year
look how that turned out
Now she ghosted me and I barely leave my house
Nobel I am coming to tink to study with you
Inside it

Sorry to hear that dude
I'm moving to KSL soon
Tink isn't cutting it
Also I finally won’t be scrawny
Will you still be there at 5?
Nobel will leave
You're supposed to have the element of surprise
when does ksl close tho
rip to ksl being 24 hours lmao
i had movie nights in ksl in like those priv study rooms
just have someone turn on their cam while in ksl for a private tour
fucking libtards at it again
My pen literally just exploded and it fell through the cracks and now I can't use it 🤡
if y'all excuse me imma leave i have mountains of work to do :D

"do or do not, there is no try"

Oh right ur supposed to sharp the 7
Yo they are gone now
~~do u wanna stay there tho~~
I'm at KSL now so I didn't see it 😎
Um zhanda what happened
Trust me, you don’t wanna know
Oh
raunak, ur emote isnt showing up cuz it might not b on american computers
That one shows, but the one in your nickname doesn't
The one in your nickname looks like an empty rectangle on my computer
It doesn't show up on my Android phone or my Windows laptop
cuz nobel is the no bell emote
Oh
sam are you using mac or pc
Prism contains pri tho
i forgot that
The dart emoji doesn't make any sense without stochastic in my nickname anymore but there's not an emoji that maps well to my new nickname
I never did

I want a parole
and ur gonna need to get some roles
Lmao I’m no longer in horny jail
You can’t make this up
@chandachan Why don't you have any roles?
The ali baba who could never enter the guffa 😂
My mom and dad would probably know idk
Oh I didn’t know that
I'm not Sikh but I am Punjabi since mom is from Amristar
Sikh is someone who practices sikhism
Oh ic
Seems noice
But then I lose them and don't know where I left it
No bro. I need to take the saath phere instead of saying kabool hai thrice
Oh Priyanka?
@sprinkles2108 Ansh wants to marry you
Uppercase pi is used to represent osmotic pressure in chemistry so the only mistake here is that they used lowercase pi instead of uppercase pi
Realization. The uppercase pi isn’t as curved
I wish I had that
I’m probably gonna take a step back and minor in psych instead so I’m not killing myself every semester
I'm thinking of doing a secondary major in math but that would require me to do 4 math/CS classes every semester and I might get destroyed if I do that
4 isn’t that much
Man did I miss the outdoors
I haven't gone outside in a week
Lemme hug you
I went out in 50 degree weather
Wasn’t bad
The wind wasn’t nice though
Don’t you already have 4 this sem?
Only if you include January session. I'm taking it easy and only taking Linear Algebra, Data Structures, and Discrete Math since February
I have 5 stem classes next sem. 3 math, 1 CS, and 1 physics
Well, if I want to double in CS and math, then 3 a semester isn't enough
Yea. Alberto told me that these classes shouldn’t be that difficult tho. Let’s see
Discrete Math and Calc 3 shouldn't be too hard if you grind a lot
ALWAYS STAY HUMBLE BETI. DON'T SHOW OFF. COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS= PRIYANKA
I don’t call myself beti what?
I'm finding that linear algebra requires me to study differently. Instead of grinding hundreds of practice problems, I'm spending more time reading the book
Linear algebra was hell for my dad at his college
I've probably only done about 100 problems in Linear Algebra this semester total
And you say I study harder than you
Went too much
On the other hand, in Calculus 2, I think I did between 500-1000 problems total in the class
WOW, YOUR DAD TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS COLLEGE CLASSES. MY DAD KEEPS TALKING ABOUT HIS FRIENDS
The final review alone had 300 questions for practice (I didn't do all of them, but I know someone who did)
Bruh most of the problems werent even related to tests oml
Especially the last few
They were wordy problems
Calculus is pattern recognition and you do a lot of problems so that when you look at the test, you instantly know which method to use
@walemelaiye @beckck no class tmw
And people still messed up sequences and series
Uh oh
Idk what is happening
OH SHITTTTTT
What happened bro?
Why didn't u tell me it was because she was sick I FEEL AWFUL NOW
LAST ONE
BRUH, WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT ACADEMICS IN THE GENERAL AND THE ACADEMICS CHAT. JUST WANTED TO BREAK THE MONOTONY
oh nooooo :(((
Is it tomorrow or Tuesday that we don't have class???
could've been the entire week if rona wasnt here
Nah he talked more about his college life than academics. Hence why he felt terrible that I couldn’t go to campus
Well, I don't have enough context to assume otherwise
My dad was also about the college experience
Then perhaps don’t make assumptions....:Thonk:
I'm on campus but still it doesn't feel like my experience so far is close to my dad's
and eat in Mitchell's alone
Call someone
Doesn’t Kush live right beside you
Case doesn't even have 7:30 AM classes though, right?
He has some early morning class. I forgot which one exactly
God Raunak. Don't describe sex like that
Not true that duct tape isn’t hot pink
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vng5mg0iY0Q @raunakwastaken This was my song after Tanvi rejection and friendship cut
Naa. I don't trust algorithms and software to pair me with someone
i hate dating apps too but apparently many people met their partners online
I read about an operations research guy who tried to use math/computer science to find a spouse but it eventually failed
He eventually married someone that he moved in with after only 3 weeks
Guys this tanvi thing been going on for at least a month now, and although it’s healthy to be sad from friendzoning, I can promise you from personal experience that it’s not gonna get better if you keep bringing it up. Just take some time not thinking about relationships at all if you haven’t already, and when you feel it’s natural go back into the dating pool however you wish. But don’t bring tanvi into this, she did nothing wrong and based off the info I’ve seen/heard I doubt she wants to be associated with this. Happy to talk more but that’s my two cents.
I mean I've never been in love or anything but that seems about right
I remember trying to date someone in high school, fun times
SAME THO
Yeah I never said it was you specifically who brought it up, I just meant as a collective we need to be supportive and not bring it up (as cheesy as it sounds)
I never wanted a relationship in high school, I was really scared of them for some reason
CWRU has the highest rate of any UAA school for marriage
still feel bad about that
I was already bullied so didn't want to be more
aw man
Damn Cameron. Girl magnet
i wasn't ready in hs either
Well it sounds like we've all been through the rodeo of highly awkward relationships/friendzoning/rejection, so hopefully you won't get gaslit anymore
I don't get the joke though and I don't see anything about it on the Internet
Oh, the only thing I could find on the Internet about salt fingers is some scientific term about mixing saltwater with freshwater
oh yeah i forgot there were multiple pics documenting this
when I forgot my camera was on and I shotgunned a handful of salt
worst mistake of my life
it wasn't even that much salt
idk it's weird, and then it takes me years to realize they're actually into me
my friends told me that if i was a friends character i'd be phoebe. idk if that's a compliment or not
aw man i loved diary of a wimpy but never watched any of the movies smh
You've missed out on childhood. Tell me you read the books at least till dog days
Nope
I read all of them till old school
It's unbelievable that we will be old in the far future and there's nothing we can do to prevent it
who hasnt heard of top gear?
I can't believe this is my physical peak and that I'm only going to get worse from here
die at the top
You’ll never get old if you die young
No one wants to die tho
I bet a lot of people would want to die young
dont u wanna die with an extra 10$ in the grave
Hoarding a lot of money until you die doesn't really help anyone
I plan to use most of my money before I die
nah. i don't wanna live forever
i plan to donate most of my money before i die
the thought of not existing is scary
I want to live as long as I can
yes but i don't wanna age
I want to be able to retire eventually
my dad doesn't wanna retire lol
uk is so socialized oml
you should be watching ur hate (read commie) speak
*sigh* guess im a communist now
but lost my progress in between
Poor Benjamin
Benjamin we are sorry
mom come pick me up im scared
uh oh
you can make a "moses sucks" role just make it a different color
it shouldnt b
damn u nitro
rip
will school still be mixed online/in person next year?
zhanda left the server?
I'm so used to living with covid i can't even imagine that
dude same tho
@everyone I have some sad news. Zhanda is no more with us. He has been permanently executed from this server
did he piss someone off?
RIP
RIP
RIP
don't
idk, nitro = simp
im sorry but that makes you a simp 4 times as much as I am then
well, that is what happened
i was told i was a simp
I couldn't show up to the SI session today because I'm busy
I am scared about in person without the vaccine 😔
i dont think i'll be getting a vaccine
apparently the indian government thinks im too young for it
That's still more than any country other than China or India
I still can't get the vaccine because I'm not 65+ or a medical worker but I should be able to get it before the summer is over
BRUH chem exam got delayed?
can someone please tell me the cause of death of zhanda?  :pepecry:
It is so quiet here without him 😂
he can't come back with his account
oh really?
"chronicle of a death foretold"
Always a huge hospital building
The infamous printers. Never used one so far lol
So bright wtf, Imma wear shades day n night
This is the first time I'm alone at Thwing eating Jolly
dont want to b near ppl w/out mask
How do I eat without mask
ugh
That's just ugh
We only had 5 cases last week
Are most buildings heated during the cold haha
@zackt7718 I'll be starting the physics homework today, but I just looked at it and I don't really know what's going on so
Ok nvm I can't do this, I'm stuck on #1 smh
Hahahaha nope actually orange county
Oh so SoCal
Aahaha some homes in nor cal dont have cooling
why is the mcat on some boomer tier schizo shit?
Dang I need to stop treating myself with so much time to sleep, I will see you guys tomorrow
Yessss I will miss it
I'm from San Bernardino, probably one of the biggest shitholes in SoCal, and I miss it when I'm in Cleveland
i HATED the weather in cleveland
SoCal isn't very humid
not even close to cleveland humidity
Ew Texas
San Antonio also boring iirc
Good i prefer cold than hot
Cold is nice for doing sports
hot > cold
cold > warm
Ngl I wish it gets colder in Palestine so I have to agree with u raunak
No howdy
Warm> cold >>>>> hot
Cold >>
raunak ur idea of cold is like 70freedom units
i'd rather be in 105 degree weather than 40 degree weather
I've experienced 100 degree weather in Houston and it was miserable
Cold >>
Jenin how was your study session?
It’s supposed to be ongoing jehehsjsbbdf
Are there places for ice skating  during winter ??? No frozen lakes tho
i would not skate on the lake tho
thats a bad idea
I remember waking up to several inches of snow last month. That was considered to be a once in several decades event
Oh I forgot..corona
*it wasnt*
lake doesnt really freeze over
Oh
Houston weather in a nutshell is "Hurricane Harvey is the third '500-year' flood in Houston in 3 years"
It was:
1) socially distant
2) we wore masks
3) if campus police wanted to harass us they would, trust me
hold on lemme find the vid
issue tho
arent the careful types
Nope
~~go onto Instagram the day after haloween and prepare to be disappointed ~~
oh no
idk
And save money for a longer trip
let alone another langauge
Guess I can’t congratulate him on his upcoming 1000 day Duolingo streak
fuck yea, i figured it out
for some reason it keeps switching languages on me
and i didnt see an edit mark
I was typing in Polish to begin with tho
How do you say “suck my baguette” in French?
zhanda's spirit be here tho
forgot
high quality pun tho
I only know his g minor piano concerto tho
oh and his violin concertos UwU
ope chat died
ur missing out
you’re right I do need a cold shower
“Take a cold shower” is an expression that means “stop being horny” @kaori_flute
Oh
I have shower with cold water for the last 5 years
Overslept by 4 hours
Is Grubhub not working for anyone else?
I had to spam through the screens to get my order to go through but it happened
tho still a bit buggy
btw pri do u still need to do something over the summer
I’m currently looking for research ~~more like still formatting my resume~~
A lot of people on this server don't think anybody can have a comfortable life
Not really, although I know on their website that they have menus up to a week in advance I think
Oh? I couldn’t find it for grubhub for some reason
Is Leutner really that bad?
Sorry should've mentioned that
its college food
There's an option that says "Days"
I'm stupid sorry
What confuses me is that the page source code doesn't even have "daniel" in it so I don't know where the Discord embed got it from
I will say, the website for Leutner is hilarious when it lists a bunch of food that it says is horrible for well-being like this
well, they aint wrong
cuz that salt aint normal
I'm surprised that the Tofu Tinga is listed as being horrible for well-being but the Chicken Tinga Tacos get a perfect score
There's probably a formula being done behind the scenes
And someone probably accidentally did something to the sodium
Which upset the caloric intake
There are way more options when it’s not COVID tho right?
I can't even recognize most structures lol
So I happened to see Ochem Structures
You seem to be very knowledgeable about courses and the instructors for courses that you haven't taken yet. Very impressive
Forget it. I don't know which class she's taking exactly
Imagine finishing that couldn’t be me
I stopped now
But their face isn’t showing though so I guess you’re fine
do we not have class the 24?
it would be more effective to have them back to back near the weekend
makes it seem longer
But we did enter later in the semester, so I cant complain
@nobelium19 how does the Spartan bot work
I’ve done nothing today
Need to start on SAGES essay
I don’t exactly remember how long each was, but I don’t think that one took long?
Because I don’t remember
the mc questions at the end
i didn't get a 50/50 on all of them
the other 3 i missed one question
Why? Do you want me to pull it up?
i can't i forgot most of them
nah ansh was wondering how long it took
Nope I can't help sorry
lol rip nw
None of them took longer than 2 hours I believe
Oh
I only got the values I haven’t figured out the word yet lol
I just need to reorder them though which won’t be bad
I kept getting the wrong word Bc I had not rounded that
Oh
It took me forever to get the word Bc I forgot to round
rip
I'm surprised you have to do the game of life in the MATLAB class, that seems fairly abstract compared to what I'd imagine the rest of the class is like
pain.
this is what it feels like, I assume?
Can't be tho as the messages show Zhandac
@sprinkles2108 I thought I knew chem until I did the practice exam, now I don't know what's happening
ahaha fam i haven't even done the practice exam yet
I don't get it
i haven't done the practice exam yet
@besanbarfieater7370 legends never die
Bruh it was asking for work = -PdeltaV and I'm like "Yeah I don't know what that is"
Well I don't know it
Last time I checked it's 106 not 105 :thonk:
there are some 105 LO's for this exam like heating curves
Imagine studying chem
i'll still send you notes on it tomorrow tho
Couldn’t be me
it was you tho
Do we need to know the aerosol, sol, gel, that stuff?
Tbh don't really know that
Couldn't tell you ketchup was a coilloid
I guess I know now
No go away
less math
That is SPECIFICALLY the reason why I don't like it
last semester was rough in terms of concepts too
That's a lot of math
i thought we already did rates
No you aint see nothin yet
nope
You have taken 14 times as many AP classes as our school offers
your school only had 1 ap?
My school didn’t have any
my school offered 22?
Well we had AP Stats, AP Calc, AP Chem and AP Bio but when I joined freshman year they stopped AP Calc, after my sophomore year they stopped AP Chem, after my junior year they stopped AP Bio, and I'm pretty sure they got rid of AP Stats after I left because of not enough demand
oh dang what on earth
my district still hasn't offered IB yet
Yeah, although it works out lol I took AP Stats my freshman year AP Chem last year they offered it and AP Bio last year they offered it
Mayhaps. I don’t remember much
cuz
and pass the exam
for that class
Well no because AP Lang, AP Gov doesn't transfer, but APUSH, AP German, AP Calc and AP Physics did
Idk
Do you want me to tuck you in?
away
@ishikak892 don’t be like Priyanka pls
chota sa baccha awwww
Do you really want to do that?
Oh
Ansh go study
woah raunak is there a side of you we don't know about?
I told you the requirements for that, and since alts are against the rules, im going to have to letcha go.
@everyone I have some sad news. Zhanda is again no more with us. He has been again permanently executed from this server
lmao rip
What are the requirements? Zhanda wants to know
Rip Zhanda
i put it in the message that gets sent to him, but I will repeat it.

"Please come back when you can respect the server rules and people's wishes"
defiantly could do with an update (however, sarah is like never on, so it makes that difficult)
but zhandas not here anymore:(
it wont be the same:(
Thomas hug me
Fair yeah
uh oh, i dont think i own any green
Fuck youre right
he knows his end draws near
we've had her for only a few months :PES_Cry:
Barbara was too good she left to become president of ALL the universities
he never decreased tuition; just slowed down the rate at which they increased with respect to inflation
and something makes me think he aint gonna continue here
Having tuition increase slower than inflation is a decrease in real terms. University tuition is generally the expense that has increased fastest in recent times except for healthcare
why the actual heck has minimum wage still not increased
that's fair. idk how he did it
im curious tho
keep the poor poor and give tax breaks to the rich
we're still at freaking $7.25 or somethin
$15 is still not up to par and yet we can't get minimum wage up to that
*stop being so political*  bro i want people to have a chance at basic income
The 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus is one of the biggest distributions of wealth in American history to the poor with almost nothing for the rich so I'm not sure it's accurate to say that the government is controlled by the rich
then explain why the rich don't want the minimum wage to increase
The minimum wage didn't increase because the Senate parliamentarian said that it could not be put into a reconciliation bill and the Democrats decided not to fire/overrule the parliamentarian
it's not even about the issue of the economy anymore
we should and i think it should work out
makes sense tho
in the short term, restaurants, chains, the people who are working for minimum wage are going to be laid off
increasing minimum wage? all it really does in the long term is buff inflation and hurt the rich
which, don't get me wrong, i'm not too opposed to, but you've gotta get something better for the poor if you're gonna be hurting the rich
raising taxes against em seems good to me, esp w/ amazon paying next to nothing in taxes
but increasing minimum wage isn't a solution
The CBO's analysis of a 15 dollar minimum wage says that it would lift a million people out of poverty but cause another 1.4 million people to lose their jobs
raising taxes ain't gonna do jack shit to the uber rich cuz they got their companies and trusts to fuck with
never said it was gonna b ez, but why dont we change that
The issue here isn't minimum wage, that's extremely surface level cuz it's basically throwing money at the problem.
The real issue is how wages and compensation no longer match productivity like in the past.
Automation's gonna seriously change shit up like how the industrial revolution did. I'd like to spawn avatars/clones of myself to work on grindy tasks so that I can be free to build myself and create some wild shit
What I'm most looking forward to with automation is expanded physical and intellectual freedom, cuz an array of smart machines can be deployed to work on a lotta shit. Lots of industries will be disrupted for sure.
And we're already buried in shit with debt
i dont think we should pay the space aliens back
we didnt even get antigrav from them
they charge a lot but they gotta pay their scientists somehow but idk
juat make the study last 20 weeks
nobody would bat an eye
How are they allowed to leave out the results from the last 9 weeks though?
Pay any german scientist a bunch of money and they prove that cigarettes are healthier than normal air
one of my neighbors was a chemical/pharma engineer in labs of big companies like Merck and Bayer, and he tells me that kinda shit is just standard practice
@halcyon6561 is right that the structural problems are wayy too convoluted for a fiscal solution to solve them, but it's a beginning, nonetheless
In addition to fake data, psychology is undergoing a replication crisis where a lot of studies can't be reproduced by other researchers
lol it's gotta be more than just training ppl to be nerds who are book smart but street stupid
The old days of prison experiments, sleep deprivation experiments and so on are gone
thats how u know that bullshit aint shit lmaooooooo
Yet another problem, higher education is really teaching useful stuff? Not just technical but microfinance, rights, democratic institutions, not just voting for representatives, but how to demand, recognize fraud, corruption etc
Even teaching parents how to raise people to decrease mental health problems on students
Ppl who wanna do advertising and marketing need to read this lmaoooooo
Reading isn’t real
when it happens its like all that shit happened outta thin air
thats the machinations involved when speaking shit into existence
yes, that's all due to predictive programming
Wouldn’t that b hard to explain Bc there’s a billion languages with their own subtleties
Languages don’t matter when u have a billion trillion dialects for each one
basic control systems work in binary (on/off)
There's actually a lot of really useful and educational content on YouTube but it's too easy to waste time on stuff that doesn't matter
the system is broken
twoset is my music education atm cuz i have not taken theory for years
There's so much useful content on the Internet but I spend too much time browsing Reddit like a 🤡
I literally only still have Instagram because everyone has it
it's been a while since i went on reddit
prolly should look in there sometime
I felt like a clown 2 weeks ago when my teacher asked me to play a B flat minor harmonic scale
So that shit didn’t stick
music theory is worse than the worst parts of physics
My aural dictation sucks but I’m blaming that on cultural differences
Studying it is like being declawed, flayed, neutered, ballgagged and sealed in an abandoned mineshaft under two miles of human SHIT
Why do you want to major in it then?
oh yeah i need to practice scales a lot
if u expect instant gratification prepare to be disappointed
Air
basic theory will work
The fucking
u don't do harmonics on piano tho
there's still chords lmao
imagine harmonics and chords tho
I do not miss piano chords
But now I hav 4mallets which sucks
Isn’t that a 6th of some sort
Close enoughish
I tried to count but I am currently indisposed
This is why I can’t listen to music when I study
Oh no why 3d animation
omg
He did nearly every lecture in a hoodie. A true Computer Scientist
I'm just sitting at my desk which is below my bunk bed and I accidentally bump my knee on the side of the desk and a screw drops onto my head 💀
Yeah I guess bunk bed isn't the right term
Doesn't work tho
Still bonk
Yep you guessed it! Except I don't have 100 screens like you do
Case is really sending me emails about how its students suffer from food insecurity when they're about to force me to pay almost $7k a year for food 🤔
To be fair it's USG that sent the email
thats mag/meg's room from last yr
Aren't all students on meal plans?
It's only for one year so it's not too big a deal but still kind of annoying that they require a meal plan for underclassmen
well some colleges require it for all 4yrs, and some require it for none, so i guess case was like fuck it and had it for 2yrs
@ishikak892  be telling a story with her pps, one day she be opening the door, let's the dog out, waits for him with the door close, then dog comes back home , sweet.
damn can’t think of anything
You need an active server first
you act as if you didnt come up w/ the name
And this poster I still haven’t opened yet
It’s still in the tube
Still waiting for that
I don’t get an id until I come on campus
don't edit we all know who it is
I applied as the class of 24
Oh really?
Really?
Never knew about that
I don’t think we’ve ever used it
I don’t look
Couldn’t be me
so declaring major, working on campus, etc
Yea I need to
First I need to speed run math lectures
wakdjdjw math
has anyone tried the sushi from the plum market?
Math is very enlightening but can require a lot of effort
kroger sushi doesn't really fill me up
still p healthy stuff
it often sold out so they must have low supply or its popular
rip meg
rip
so you can only get sushi if you're on a meal plan? that doesn't sound right
u could prob get in house for regular $ or case cash but on grubhub sushi doesnt show up on the reg menu
i wish subway wsa close
it is close
that's pointless cuz engineers don't eat they just rise and grind
its always sold out
SERVER IS NOT BOOSTED ANYMORE
im still boosting it but ig im the only one
Nah, just make it seem difficult so everyone else says omg he's a stemlord
U can study business but get super serious about it
if i worked super duper hard maybe i could've done bme but my work ethic is awful
Aren't you bme
You still can
nope
It's all up to how hard you want to work
nah too late bme has a very rigid schedule
lol sir i only work hard when im on a time-crunch
yeah my work ethic is far too damaged to be diligent
Lol but you do have a good work ethic.  You need it for medical school too and I believe you have jt.
I didn't choose cs cause tbh u can study many of those things completely remote
what are you studying again?
Cs might need a huge server room or something but still I like the get hands dirty
Haven't decided mech or aero
cs just doesn't interest me and there's nothing wrong with the field. i just don't vibe with it
fair
Ur lab is a hooman brain tho, so like quite niche too and requires a pretty good stomach
ironically i can handle that stuff BUT i can't handle botched skin. hence why i can't do dermatology
To people working with anatomy
internal medicine doesn't look at much gory stuff either
U like it, I do too but u actively work with that or going to, so respects
I'm scared of harming people
So I'd rather work with objects but that's me
You can take out my eyes and shit
Lol the scary part is giving your peers injections or them giving you injections in medical school
Lmao wtf
My friend's parents who are doctors also said it happened lol
is it a neutral thing tho
Oh that’s perfect cause I’m passing away next week
oh yeah i already booked my flight for this saturday lol
Let me guess: math and CS exams?
@_frostyyyyy_ will you cry at my funeral?
@raunakwastaken I won't cry in your funeral
I'd play November rain
Playing November rain >>> crying on a funeral
that is against raunak's wishes tho
Nah you got it wrong. It’s worship and prayer.
I didn't know you listened to anything other than classical
Nothing
ur missing out im sorry
I find it to be distracting. I often prefer silence
can't imagine life without it
i don't listen to kpop
i like to study in silence sometimes
It do hit hard
I've done some studies and I'm pretty sure music has no effect on my productivity, but it does make me work a lot longer
I'm doing physics homework atm
i need to start on that
i need to do math and music lkhlwkhw
just send it to me or something, I don't have Spotify Premium anymore but the ads aren't that bad
Isn't Spotify Premium very cheap for college students?
Idk but I'm not paying for it
which isnt even a dollar
the hardwares are more expensive here. iphone is more than a 1000 dollars
They dont
they don't
Yeah but I'd be the only one using it since my family only has 3 people and my parents refuse to pay anything subscription bar internet and phone and utilities 💀
if you have an iphone in india consider yourself very fortunate methinks
You couldn't tell?
ok omw to india to buy an iPhone
i thought you were but just wanted to make sure
i feel guilty for making my parents spend money on me
i can't help it?
idk
I doubt that you spend more than you need to
Coffee from Starbucks once a week is nothing
i thought once or twice a week was bad
I never have gotten anything from Starbucks before
There's some people that just buy expensive stuff everyday for no reason. A 3 dollar coffee from Starbucks occasionally doesn't make a big difference in a budget
i prolly got it once in an airport
but i will not do that anymore
It's kinda sad that I've rode the Chinese bus transportation more times than American bus transportation but
Tbh I don't know, I just guessed
damn thats cheap
I live in a small town, no need to; if we're in a bigger city it's either subway/tram/whatever or just drive around
What are you saying. They can afford IPhones but iphones are a bad version of phones
i haven't taken much public transportation either
just don't get starbucks
ez
American's transportation system is terrible
Unless you live in a really big city there's not really a need for public transportation because everyone has a car
yep we don't have public transport in my suburb
we suck at infrastructure
People in my state have been trying to build HSR between the big cities (Austin, Dallas, Houston) for years but nothing is really happening
Kinda arbitrary tho
the worse it is
It goes from bad to worse to worst
idk the actual word for it
But really the infrastructure sucks ass in India
good. don't want you getting in trouble
Aww
Anyways, there's a metro that's being built in India for like 5 months. It's still there
You said don't want you getting in trouble. So I took that in a caring way basically
in palestine it's vans and taxis
unless u want to go past the wall u ride a special bus
aww priyanka
Ok I'm going to get to work I'm so behind so
aww raunak
mood i need to grind for chem
Don't grind too hard. You don't want to be coffee powder from beans
music and math time
It's so dead outside today. It's been raining for 4 hours or so
ok will waste 13 more mins and then go study
Never mind what I said earlier, summer is grind time too
Aww ❤️🤗🫂
An expression of endearment, or when you feel like something is cute/sweet/touching/whatever
wanted
Oh, I guess I set myself up for that one
ansh feels like you are cute/sweet/touching
priyanka i miss u
i miss you more 🥺
It was dead yesterday. I'm sure you missed us
Our family has had some painful experiences in Hong Kong. My mom got the side of her foot stuck in a ferry.
My dad took it out. That was painful tho
I was able to get to most places in Beijing that I wanted to visit by using a bus or the subway
@moseslee wtf
the least i could do after being too slow to offer you data structures help
Better late than never
this doesnt make up for it tho
raunak don't make priyanka guilty
@_frostyyyyy_ class is in 25 mins right?
I guess I forgot about class
idk
i need to study awjfhakjfealkrf
study session vc
How does that work
Is that certain yet or are you just trying right now?
ive told anjali and zhanda that im joining theirs
sorry
He prob knows all the important shit by now
I said nothing
Omg
I guess I won't have this convo on discord
coke is coca cola smh my head
I'm just trying to divert
I liked so much the coca cola with coffee sold in Asia maan that was good
It took so long to arrive here
What? I've never had coke with coffee. They sell that :cursed_flushed:
I really only got like 3 weeks of break back in late December/early January and I still spent a good portion of that studying
I'm still managing to get enough sleep though. I got like 8 hours of sleep today
Is the class hard overall or is it just the hw lol
well im not a big brain so its very hard, and there is something w/ chem teachers at this school and a inability to teach under rona
as an example, i've spent 8h and only been able to possibly solve 4 questions from the 20 queston hw
I can't get everything I want done. Compromise is needed and I decide that sleep is important to me. Sometimes I only go to 2-3 clubs in a particular week if I'm busy and I frequently skip reading the books for classes where I feel good enough about my knowledge
I still manage to hit 8-10 hours but I don’t do any clubs so it works fine
He only rises and grinds. He time for nothing else😤😤
I keep trying to work ahead so I can spend weekends in bliss
damn this was honestly a more heartfelt response than I was expecting ngl, it's really hard to remember that self > school at zoom university
But eventually I fuck myself over 🤠
No my situation is really bad
You guys don’t even know
I do NOTHING the whole day
I mean if capitalism mindset keeps me from burnout death lessgeddit
The due dates and test dates motivate me
Maybe if this was actual college my work ethic would be better
If you place self ahead of school though then it can be hard to get into the graduate school you want
School isn’t taking care of me
Because grad schools want to see good GPA, research experience, good test scores, etc. and if you prioritize self over those things, then someone who didn't get any sleep will have an advantage
gotta die w/ that extra Washington in the coffin i guess
Damn what kinda sad philosophy says you can’t have self care AND good grades
I feel like ur saying it’s impossible to have a healthy and well balanced lifestyle, but I think that ain’t right
Oh I had that too
I find that sleep is very useful to my ability to study but that exercise isn't as helpful, so I make sure to get an average of 7+ hours but I stop working out during crunch time
Only two more months tho
But college is so much work
half of it is fun work imo though
I’m behind in lectures oopsies
I just really like my major though
Ok then go study
When I applied to Case last year they didn't require essays 👀
@ishikak892 stay away from college bro. like go on a vacation or something
Oh
Lol I would go on vacation before college if corona did not exist
I can’t stop laughing
why cant you?
I wanted to go to Europe last summer
i mean yea sure dont go to Europe
Um my  grandmother  had covid last to last month and she was in the ICU. It took her a very long time to recover
I don't think they do actually even during this test-optional year after looking at the application page
oh shit. i hope shes better now
P sure you had to submit a personal essay last year
I haven’t traveled since February of last year🥺
My fam with india last semester smh
I wanna go on one so bad but my parents probably won’t let me🥲
Idk
same tho :')
Parents can’t say anything
They can’t
how did they move the building into the lagoon? That seems like quite a lot of money to do 🤔🤔🤔
I’m still their babi
even in college?
pain, same
even your parents jenin?
I live in California so did not get the chance yet
No, returning to monkey is not ideal. I like the modern world. It just happened that this monkey was very lucky
People apply to a lot of universities that are far away
Stones throw away
The farthest school I applied to was in California
🤏 just a bit away
Cali is technically close to India
nope
Oh really?
I applied to only one school in Cali so it was that school or I stay east
cause the sum needs to be 24
Bruh then with that logic Australia is SO far away from Cali???????????
Oh ye convenience visits
rip
Too spread out, hate the walking thing
i dont think so
im not a bird. idk
I think u need to stop regardless
wtf is scaremenbtp
Are you serious rn
Some of y’all didn’t memorize every state capital of the US in fifth grade and it SHOWS:kittyvibe:
i need to get off discord. why am i still here
I once again make my point, capitals mean fucking nothing why do I need to kno
sorry but i have not lived in the US most of my life
Springfield doesn’t even matter
Never cared ab them either
smh my head
Idk
ron doesnt even know what the states are, let alone cities
Doesn’t matter much does it
Never learned it the animatics way
smh my head
Even in person tours don’t get the full thing
oh excellent!
*pakistan* don't think i didn't see your unedited text lol
8 hours
and you were the one calling this server dead :P
The 2025 server is quite dead, there are many days when only around 30 messages are sent
It is quite dead
Predicted before Christmas that the 2025 server would be dead
Idk I think because random sketchy people joined
I was calling the over server dead
I just wanna sleep man but I need to send my declaration form ASAP
Not bad at all
How'd u get away with that
So I got away with it
Fire alarm went off at clarke
rip
Wtf
After I’ve already used my swipes for the week
I waited a week for stir fry for some fucking reason and now that they have it I can’t get it
I’m paying this much for food and yet
anything to get away from ALEKS
what u want on the order
finn do u want me to teach u how to stir fry
Hm i'm gonna chill another 5 minutes doing ALEKS then I'll head to leutner
@ansh8867 is content still going on?
oh
@ansh8867 why would you push an elderly Chinese grandmother down the stairs last Friday
Please stop perpetuating hate against the APIDA community. Your actions have had a negative impact on the advancement of race relations in the Asian community.
If I hated the Asian Community so much, why would I talk to many people then
Why would I be friends with you and what hate did I spread?
@lawsarethreats Ansh Bhatia pushed an elderly Chinese grandmother near Euclid last week; his behavior is unacceptable and he must be held responsible for his actions.
You think I would push someone on purpose
I was with you last Friday damn it
Ansh pushed an elderly Chinese grandmother at Euclid last Friday
SHUT THE FUCK UP ZHANDA
I've had enough of this shit
Yo u won't last one day?
I have all my right to be pissed at you : False Allegations
We need to spread awareness to the recent crimes against the APIDA community.
What crime? I didn't do anything
please don't listen to Zhanda
Just one OFFICE OF EQUITY thing can't be stretched too far man. Pls for the love of god
Wish me luck
Damn i hope not
@quintus_fabius_ find your @soul032713mate
That'd be horrible I'm leaving in six months
rober is not looking for anything serious
rober just wants to have some fun 😉
Today, several hours ago
Don't get in trouble basically
are zhanda and ansh still fighting?
yess omg
Sorry
Oh no @ansh8867 what did you do?
nothing
I guess the china- india conflict near kasmir has just escalated to unprecedented levels
It's not me. Every Indian person doesn't have to mean me Zhanda
Absolutely terrible
"Oh shit here we go again"
wow ansh i never thought you were like this
seems so
I will never bring my grandmother near Ansh.
First of all, how would one even see someone push someone down the stairs. Makes no sense
Sorry to be that guy but I found a hole in your bulletproof logic
I just pushed someone down the stairs to test, and people walking by saw
They’re mad at me now but now we know for sure that people can see if you push someone down a flight of stairs
It's been proven, I guess facts don't care about your feelings
I just pushed someone else down a flight of stairs wearing a mask and people still recognized me
Ansh wasn’t wearing a mask at the time of the de-stairing
I need a crayon drawing of the crime scene
Some stranger in hitchcock would know. I don't even know most people in hitchcock
Nobel was never with me
ansh i would never bring my grandma near you
omg ig we won't invite him to our bday party then
sorry ansh
The idea is. If it even did happen, I would apologize and not be looking straight while doing it
@chandachan who do you want to be
I guess @ansh8867 is representing himself
since i am the jury, i declare ansh gulty
death threat to the jury?
the air force
Can't find me
don't troll the man that would've been my roommate if not for covid
sorry kevin
smh my head my head
Don't know what happened but thanks for sticking up for me Zach
Oh zhanda thinks your mom is hot
And there’s no place open that I can eat at without getting diabetes in the long run
I would guess the former
I don't know the specifics, but I've never actually smelled and seen smoke coming out of a building and they brought 3 trucks with lights and sirens, 4 CWRU PD officers, and 3 security people
Sorry for cursing at you Zach
damn
I've just never seen that many respond
i cant see my screen now
oh um
dude whenever there's sirens outside my window my entire room just goes into rave mode
holy shit go outside
My bad. I was just saying how the x-axis depends on where cross product occurs with y and z axis
I literally never use LinkedIn tho
I’m already very sleepy, so I doubt today will be productive
very funny i can't stop laughing
studying for Math 126, CSDS 233, and JAPN 202
I have Econ math and CS midterm this week
I'm so scared about the CS midterm
I don’t think I have any more midterms...
Thankfully, my exams are spaced out this semester, so I have a maximum of 2 in a week other than finals week
yall suggestions are bad
Imma sound like a fat ass
And so I’m actually trying to see how far I can push 17 swipes
But it’s annoying that they only open at 5
ye, the hours have been wack
open late and close early is their motto this yr
I couldn't find anything on Google or CWRU's website about it
They don’t care
never had an insomnia cookie
really?
Seems like most of the BME majors I know are specializing in biomaterials
I haven't updated my linkedin yet, but I will definitely do it during the summer
Cuz that’s what I’m low-key interested at
Still figuring out if I can balance it with other stuff tho
@moseslee u don't have a mostache there :0
Did you Photoshop the mustache off? It looks like the same photo except for the mustache
I didn’t have the moustache originally
My dad has a PhD so I've actually heard him called Dr Frost
My brother wants to get a PhD too so if I don't get one then I'll be one of the less educated members of my family 🤡
Oh
My dad couldn’t care less if he only has a masters
Lmao aren’t all of those professional degrees
Yeah I got it wrong, professional degree isn't the right term
What’s important is that one is confident in their line of work
That isn't bad in itself (it should even be good), but schools aren't expanding fast enough for all of the qualified students
Rip 
Is law a little less competitive than getting into medical school lol
I was just curious haha
I heard medical schools have like a three percent acceptance rate 🙃
The best law school in the country, Yale Law School, has an acceptance rate of 8 percent which is much higher than Stanford Med acceptance rate of 2.5 percent
My parents want me to apply to law school
Do you think you want to?
Not sure yet if I want a MS, an MBA, a PhD, or a JD
Literally I was in between premed or prelaw 
Still researching options and all haha 
Tho I have to decide if I want to do premed by this summer because the class selection is rigid
Hard work!!!! Make sure to find a balance too 🙂
Or graduate school I guess?
I actually felt really good this morning, I went to sleep at 3 and woke up at 11 and have felt very energetic all day and got a lot done today
I'm going to get a good sleep on Friday night before the math competition too
I should probably go to sleep soon in order not to feel horrible tomorrow morning
I have lazy weekends too but I stopped doing them because I felt overworked and panicked for the rest of the week 🤡
I do have to prep for AP calc exam tho 🤡
I have two exams this week but I have to start preparing for them early so I started last last week
I have an exam in 10 hours that is 40% of my final grade
Yikes, what class?
Can't imagine having one exam be 40 percent of the grade
oh friday no work either for sure ~~unless we have deadlines wee~~
~~pls don't be like me~~
mhm study time bye ~~pls don't ping i beg~~
If I just had a day subtracted each week then I would probably fall behind on my work
I'm just so inefficient that I need to study every day to keep up
i see why i'm so behind in work
So hard working!!
I don't think an American has ever been Secretary General though, so POTUS is probably more in reach
david u will work in every position u ever get
time to fail test omo
@nobelium19 I was wondering what that emoji in your name is since it's just a rectangle on my display and apparently it's an iOS and macOS only emoji
cuz im a macbook elite
Never used a Macbook in my life
The ZenBook was terrible though so I switched to a ThinkPad
fair enough
i haven't caught up in my bio lectures yet
I get my hair cut by Danny
cut your own hair first
I'm gonna be a day behind in everything because of midterm exam tomorrow and I'm like 2 weeks behind in LO's for bio
I actually need to. It’s very long now
Hate to say this but you're actually really behind then lol
Don't think you can finish them today
just go get it cut then
i got mine cut in december im fine lol
I need to speed run life
My motivation for watching lectures is not wanting to fail
I have 3-4 assignments every week in linear algebra so if I went two weeks without watching lectures then I would fail all of those assignments
i went weeks without watching lectures so i'm failing :D
Weeks?
weeks
I have classes with assignments based on lectures that are due like 2 days afterwards so that's not an option for me
rip
im sorry
It forces me to study though and I think it causes me to focus more
MATH 307: Linear Algebra
Homework assignments due before every lecture at 9:25 AM Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
Is that a difficult class?
I would say it is but not as difficult as Data Structures. It's a theoretical class and the average grade for exam 1 was 84 percent. Workload is average but the content is more difficult than calculus imo
oh really?
Someone said calc 3 is a bit easier than calc 2
I might do that idk. Cause I already have 2 math classes
I would rank it at second most difficult class I'm taking right now behind Data Structures. It's not too bad in difficulty considering that it's a 300-level math class
Then it would be 3 math, 1 CS and 1 phys for next sem
holy hell 3 math classes?
If you count discrete math as math and not CS
oh
The only calculus I've used is several integrals though and very basic integrals at that
Really?
well it's a lot of math
but if you like math
altho can't comment on math 307 yet
Easy, feels like an "intro to advanced math" class (proofs, logic, sets, etc.)
Since calc3 is easier and calc 2
I have a lot of reqs left 🥲
i think it depends on your prof tho
How was the class then
uh it was very boring
bruh david remembers the professors name even though i forgot
oh
really?
Darn it website not updated yet smh
when your neighbors are blasting Justin Beiber's *baby* song when you're trying to study for midterms
But it's not really it
But i have class and I'm not missing class
howdy wtf
Dead chat
dead klam khat
I got away saying I did official Matlab courses but I want to see whether I'm deep in shit lol
My guess is for a Rocket Team leadership position since they had a meeting today and both of them are active participants in the club
oh
im in car club
where make car
car go
car club
you build an offroad car
damn rl
dont u die
how many people have died in the club
oh shit
nah but there's a lot of shit to do
we do some modeling and validation which is a lot of math
seems like a large commitment tho
ive been in the bay working on an electrical system to collect telemetry for like temperature and wheel/engine speeds
idk you can choose the path that you go on
seems intense huh
some people cnc components for the car in olin, one of the other engineering buildings
@jaff_er that's sick af lmao
@.fim. bruh why don't you go to math club
Math
How close is your housing to the basketball arena?
its so incredibly loud tho
this isnt for a game its just people playing pickup
i mean school only takes so many hours of the day
fair
me neither he needs his weirdchamp role back
fair
Before I knew i won't come for the fall 2020 I chose my residence cause it was the closest to the basketball court
just beiber recieves too much hate imo
that guy receives hate?
i meant i dont think its like serious hate
i was never a belieber lol
too bad for u 😎
idk how he got sm hype lol
sucks to suck
i used to hate her but now i sort of tolerate her
Omg
damn ur missing out
"I like it" is a serious bop
holy shit thats SUCH A MEME
don't let them know
holy fuck this is the whitest thing ive ever seen
Don't let them know what?
i dont even dislike those bands its just such a meme
the standard colors are boring
holy shit
Post Malone became so bad
he cant answer
now i ain't saying she a gold digger
im tryna find some again
the shit i got is too far west
@raunakwastaken OMG ARE YOU KIM KARDASHIAN WEST???
if it's shit that too many people listen to
i got a bit harder time taking it seriously
oh yes im sorry my plastic queen
fair
I'm saying that it can be used too easily on many people, antifa and blm were called terrorists
In Colombia a guerrilla group attacked a military base, and all media said it was terrorism, it was not, it was a military objective, even int organizations didn't recognize the attack as terrorism
I want to save $15-20k a year once I graduate so that I can have a couple million to retire on
i want to study econ so i can make better arguments about why socialism is good 😎
David don’t have kids. Ez
this is why we need to bring back child labor
wait i just realized those arent even fireflies
I actually like life and think it would be good if humanity doesn't die
then there's raunak who wants robots to replace us all
raunak wants me to be jobless one day :pleadcry:
@_frostyyyyy_ fortunately its pretty obvious natural selection that anyone who doesnt want kids will quickly see their genes out of the gene pool 👀
Problem is that in modern society, a lot of people who want to have kids say they can't for economic reasons
bruh why do you hate us
There are people on this server who say that they don't want kids because having a family costs money
nah if i have a stable career i want kids
but first a man has to want me
@chandachan but at least they died with convicting they were martyrs
The fertility rate in Japan is declining sharply because most couples nowadays want to chase their goals into the 50s
fair, there are things my dad wanted to do but couldn't cuz he was busy raising my sister and i
Wtf lol
And who wants kids 🙄
They also need kids to work the land for their parents when they grow old
Japan is so clean
David isn't your mom japanese
eh i dont think population decreasing is too much of an issue, besides like i said most of people who dont have kids are already wealthier and dont care much about the incentives
Sake hits hard
ah gotcha. i was worried that i misunderstood you the first time
its not just that tho, like even within america say, where anyone could theoretically buy contraceptives for very cheap, wealthier and more educated people choose to have less children than poorer people
999 is officer dead for police
i bet some of them owned slaves tho
> except as a punishment for crime
(only lowkey tho)
Isn't newsweek a conservative tabloid 😒
@.fim. has a point, why prisoners would get paid less or work for longer or in worse condition ??
damn
She wasn't able to fulfill it, but Biden recently ended private prisons
Wasn't it that for black kids 1 in very few of them have parents in jail?
yeah i didnt mean it as an attack on biden i was just clarifying
The alternative wasn't ending it in state prisons too, the alternative was keeping private prisons which Trump would have done
I met an American girl, no cap, I was studying with her abroad cause she snitched her human trafficking parents in the states and was under witness protection abroad
jeez wtf
based as fuck 😎
isn't chomsky a linguist?
@chandachan we want u in the server please
Damn its been a while since I've used the middle finger emoji
Sad
🔫 don't ping
The answers are like 25 digits long or something... unless you have a supercomputer, brute force will take longer than your lifetime
why do u hate me
i hate that i get this
I thought you don't watch anime
bcz i have to study OwO
Don’t like that guy
DS test in 30 mins
Damn
nuu i would never 🥺
wtf is this then: https://discord.com/channels/669280377680035842/700108433197760572/824120686900936705
i hate you
Don't ping
wtf is going on
To the office of equity?
fuck u thats why
imma go cry bye :pepecry:
u called me stupid 😠
bully fim & die 😠
Man I missed you for PHYS in person
it's been a while since i went to phys in person
idk :')
(huh) pack in the mail it's gone
omg i forgot to watch last weeks lectures
aight back to studying
ayo what went down here
Discord has died for me, not sure why
Nobel thinks there was a campuswide Internet outage for a moment since only the off campus people stayed connected to VC
Oh damn
I don’t eat Chicken 😳
My sages professor said it's damn good
Oh when?
i'm not really participating in urs
i didn't run cuz i don't even engage with urs :ohgod:
I feel vicarious embarrassment for the people that ran
honestly idk maybe help people find research opportunities and connections idk
honestly i feel bad for them
they didn't have to publicly 'shame' them like that
they straight up said we're canceling elections for the president cuz no candidate is qualified yet
oh fuck i just read it
Imagine being allowed to run for leadership of a club and then the club shuts down the election because they couldn't imagine letting you run it
how is it really possible that no qualified candidates ran?
but idk tbh
but that doesnt mean the students are new
oh so they had qualified people last year?
I believe so, but the two candidates for President of URS this year didn't have much research experience which I guess is a requirement
yeah I forgot who it was
@chandachan When are we leaving
It doesn't work like that. Anyways, call me when you're done
bruh i literally just replied to someone
They scrubbed their letters of intent so I can't see how many people ran anymore but I remember two candidates
didn't they email out the letters tho?
i wish i joined more organizations but *COUGH* covid
same tho
tho
generally i prefer research/work experience over that shit lmfao
I'm trying to research/work experience but I'm finding it difficult to find a lot of opportunities that are available to freshmen. Most things I'm looking at prefer sophomores/juniors
i'm just not sure why ur worried about not doing enough
that would be the least of my concerns, since i'd only do shit if i want to, and i would focus on the high value/high stakes shit first
Yeah I think freshman year should be for just learning and getting fundamentals I guess. Because without fundamentals, we may not know much when doing experienced based learning right
the other reason why shit like ECs should only be done if ur genuinely interested in them is cuz of time management and priorities
cuz if u try to smatter ur schedule with 3465985823 of em, u won't have time to learn shit for ur classes
i need to get back into learning shit on the piano
cuz of @moseslee i wanna finish learning some of chopin's etudes for the piano
lowkey wish i took ap music theory in hs
About EC's tho, I'm fine for now ig. Just need clinical experience and some research this summer or next sem
i cant help but say something weird whenever someone says that this server is wholesome
Bro, you would be lonely without this server Raunak
I guess he agrees
PUPPY IS SLEEPY :cliffordsmile: :cliffordsmile:
what makes you feel i am not lonely now?
raunak you are not lonely you have us :Hug:
:Hug:
I'm on campus and feel kinda lonely lol
Awww well we all are here and will be on campus in the fall
im at home and im lonely and going mentally insane teehee
Whenever I open my mouth to talk, the crowd dissipates because I never brush my teeth 👋
I wish I could've done the scavenger hunt
Your straw broke 😂😂
The force wind exerted so my phone flies off the table was insane
priyanka you are really endearing
@_frostyyyyy_ hi, stop studying 🛑
You're arrested for studying too much
@_frostyyyyy_ You're arrested by the dean of office of fun for studying
I will miss eating daal at home tho
I haven't studied enough today tbh, I've been too busy coding my programming assignment
Coding is kinda like studying
That's studying 😁
When is it due?
Damn. That's tight
Are we gonna do math today?
coding=still doing work
Didn't you just say to stop studying?
I'll probably study some midnight probability and speed run
But yeah, I mostly did testing today. My code seems to work fine but I need to do more tests to ensure it completely works
If we don't get the problem by hand
Um, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to start using code to solve problems in a math competition
still morally wrong
Remember the loop I showed you for one of the problems
Nobel we need you to come through for a few problems 👀
Oh, apparently the show got rid of the phone a friend thing in 2010 because of widespread access to the Internet
Guess
Yep, wasn't that hard right
Nobel's not participating in that though
Honestly, I don't know if I can wake up at 8:30 am
I got up at 9:00 today and that was a miracle since I closed the lights while sleeping I guess
Zach is a math major right
CS, considering math as a secondary
Raunak, how are you in Math?
We're against legends and representing the Math Club. Math Club Patriotism (Sine me up) 🇲🇾
Then, I went to India and got lost with Janna Ganna Manna at first
yeah dw we won't mock it
it was clearly aimed at someone who called it "cringe"
why can't we kneel during anthems
I heard you support Pakistan death camps. Y
I just did a quick search and it looks like he hates him, so I guessed incorrectly
Just a vanilla BST is what we're supposed to do for the programming assignment
He’s done way worse shit than that trust me
Which I don't think meshes well with any API
Please don't think I'm an anti-nationalist. I was speaking from the perspective of a lost 10 year old figuring out his way in India
@ansh8867 Did you say last night that you don't like biology and that you don't like plants?
I don't like too much bio as in doing a major in that only
you dont like 'Murica?
tap repeatedly on the discord icon in the top left
Oh no
It made some weird sound once but now I can't get it to play again
raunak is going to report me to the office of equity for the thing I said to him
Stay on laptop
it gets annoying
if u don't do it again
Apparently the median for Exam 2 in ENGR 145 is 67 :cursed_flushed:
better than last year
Seems like a lot of people on this server hate America
It's been that way ever since Washington, DC's government was established in 1871, all due to the Act of 1871
thats cuz america isnt rising and grinding, we need you to inspire america to rising and grind till the day u die
idk how to
I think that America is the quintessential nation for rising and grinding since people here work long hours and like entrepreneurship
solid shit son
real Gs go all in with 168 hours a week
nah fuck that
Elite finance, medicine, law, etc. will require some 100+ hour weeks sometimes and it's difficult to avoid it if you want to pursue one of those career paths
i've mentioned this before, how in the future once we have advanced AI, we can basically make clones of ourselves to work on hella shit at once
nah u haven't experienced 168 hrs/week, weakling
damn
Finn, dont you know you need to rise and grind!
bezos working for less than 3h a week is cuz he rised and grinded, totally legit 100%!!!!!11!!1
Bezos ensures that he gets 8 hours of sleep a night on average
@.fim. can you help me with math quickly
ye that's why i have my clones only use 2/3 of their time working on shit
There was a big uproar recently about Goldman Sachs analysts working 100 hours a week. Those hours are unavoidable if you want to get into elite finance
ofc he can sleep 8 hours a night
He says that he needs 8 hours of sleep to make good decisions
yeah im not denying that, im just saying 100 hours a week is way more than u think
or u can hop on speed and go on and on for multiple days in a row without sleep
that's what hella bankers do to boost their long hours lmfaoooooo
youre actually just wrong tho
not too bad tbh
i wouldn't mind doing shit from 7 am to 8 pm
Investment banking is still really difficult to get into because a lot of people are willing to work 90 hours a week
that'll be about 14 and a half hrs per day
so if i got a lotta extra shit on my plate, that'll take me til 9:30 to get all that outta my way
well yeah no shit
i think that's more or less what u gotta do before u go grinding away at shit
so that way if ur working from 7 am to 9 pm u can go hard
There are some things out of my control but I want to look back on my college career and be able to say that I did the best with what I had
over in china, they go hard to a 996 schedule
9 am to 9pm daily, from monday to saturday
which is much less strenuous than an investment banker's schedule, but still a lotta time to do shit
yes. that's fair. but someone who couldn't afford to go to college and had to work straight out of hs to support their family is gonna have a harder time becoming successful even if they work super hard. no one is the same
I agree, which is why it's better for a country to be richer rather than poorer so students can focus on studying
"hard work" isn't everything, but u have to understand what ur doing and do it well
ok, then let's have the US give a lot of its extra money to India, sound fair? they need more money, and we waste a lot of it
throwing money at the problems
nah, he said countries need to be richer, so im just using his logic
im just vibin all the time, so i don't have time for bullshit
yall are missing the point lmfao
The lack of prosperity in poorer countries is caused by more than just time management though
lotta poor countries are run by tinpot dictators who only want more for themselves and less for others
history go brrrrrrrrrrr
so that ain't helpful in improving the state of affairs there
india woulda been better off if left alone and you can never change my mind
any country colonized by britain would've been better off if left alone
but still
I agree. I've heard that a lot of the 90-100 hours a week is wasted but is used as a test by the employer to see if you are dedicated enough to the job
all i want is just to keep vibin and going hard
For example, people in Japan stay in offices late because nobody wants to be the first person to leave
i've read about how 8-hour work days are not optimal and end up being less productive. the proposal was to have 4 or 5-hour work days instead
cuz with 8 hours
i've finished $500 landscaping projects in just 6 hours before, so i prefer trading actual added value for money rather than time for money
office jobs would bore me to death, i can't do that shit
but if i could just do what i'd do for school and go library hopping while working on shit, then that would work
There are some very wealthy people that never started their own company. For example, Warren Buffett
imma be a stripper. ez money
AI onlyfans - train a computer to generate nsfw images and put them up on onlyfans
cuz for income tax, u get taxed before expenses
the old saying goes, a fool and his money are soon parted
if u wanna wank off to shit u can find a lotta high quality material on the internet for free
A fool and his money are easily parted
cant be a fool if ur rising and grinding 29/10
it was a joke lol if you couldn't tell
it shouldnt have been tho
u fuck with their emotions
all i want is just to vibe and go hard
we need to give more money to israel
This is like saying that Jeff Bezos isn't charitable because he only gave 100 million dollars to help homeless people instead of 1 billion
so that God's Chosen are taken care of
wtf
poor israel it's in dire need for financial aid
idk man
still laughing about how india got a whoppin $71 million for 1.3 billion people :Kek:
and wasnt just to give 5 cents to each person
i was memeing man ofc it wasn't actually for the people
Oh
it could be tbh idk
sorry for ping zhanda ily <3
raunak i can't believe this
raunak i don't love you anymore you don't love pri
yes i am very mad at you
I can't talk to him
i wish my president was trump
im always serious
Do most people on this server hate America?
@_frostyyyyy_ we're serious all the time are we not?
wtf does this mean
Don't Muslims get persecuted in India for running beef factories 😒
dunno
i cant imagine theres much demand for beef tho
honestly, beef is cringe tho, no cap
A bunch of people in the GroupMe for 2024 are mad that I said that a 2.5 percent increase in housing price is not an increase in real terms since inflation is also 2.5 percent
It looks like Priyanka and Raunak have joined in the roasting because they're liking messages like "Bruh my parents salary didn't increase by 2.5%"
i dont think anyone is roasting you david
sorry
lots of peoples parents salaries probably did increase by 2.5% or more tho...
True, median household income is increasing over the long run and I have no doubt that many people got salary raises last year
we shall make our wishes there
I recommend starting with op 25, no 2
Omg and so underrated too
Oh damn
Left hand, right hand, finger dexterity, leaps or voicing?
I need the bop
oh swipes
Will they still have to-go orders once everything reopens in-person?
if you want to go on a pure basis of just swipes, you could theoretically get unlimited food when luetner is open for reals
If Leutner is so bad then why do people continue to eat there when are other options? Is it more convenient?
who said leutner is bad
its college food
finn hates all food
Meg and Neel said that it is really bad
and it is real bad compared the expertise that meg has when it comes to cooking
simply put, the food is nothing to write home about, and they really like tofu and zucchini
leutner is not that bad, it's just not good
The reviews for it on Yelp are really negative
they saw maybe 2 -3 bad reviews, which all places have and refused to go
missed out on a fantastic bite due to the nature of listening to reviews
however, you dont really got that choice, of saying no (unless rona somehow continues)
so i'd stop looking at the reviews made by disgruntled students who didnt get a 5 course meal
Every restaurant has bad reviews so a few aren't disqualifying, but this review in particular scared me
and guess what, hope u dont get that lmao
RIP.....
plus it was 3yrs ago, and while its not great food, i have not gone hungry which is all the purpose it needs to serve
IDk what that is lol
It is the only university on the country where having a better computer is more important than a girlfriend.
I think this could be said about a lot of tech/engineering focused colleges though
partly cuz we're the same school essencially
its completely fresh clean canvas for u
RIP
the fuck drugs u on that ur inspecting a report we did about 3h b4 it was due that hard
these descriptions tho
oh no
Where dreams go to die.


Case is primarily a school of engineering. It is a place that few with souls choose to go. Those foolish enough to attend this place of learning with any part that lasts forever are soon stripped of it.  This was another dictionary definition I found.
UChicago is described as "where fun goes to die" but it's a good school so don't treat this stuff too seriously
```9,308 LAN parties, 898,048 gallons alcohol, 12,498,203 lbs. marijuana, 12 broken elevators, 0 sunny days, 10 week quarters, 3.95 avg GPA, 323,897,108,304,103 bricks, 12,384,304,142 cigarettes, 9,301 anime junkies, 24 jocks, 5,603 that will make more money than you```
It is, CWRU degrees have the highest value of any Ohio school degrees according to Georgetown
oh these are glorious
if u didnt know "think beyond the possible" is our "slogan"
drink away the pain and suffering, plus "parties"
Literally people are studying for math competition on Friday nights 😂 Yep haha
sift through the trash and so sad its true to find absolute gold
Howdy why are you awake
@everyone go sleep
Jenin go to sleep
elijsnwhne im dying gn
damn nice
When it's not too late in California 😂
Uchicago is “where fun goes to die”
should i be worried
there isnt a backyard around here thats big enough to contain gunshots afaik
oh yeah i'm not being a money racist or smth
its just geography i guess
yes there are differences between rich and poor areas, redlining do go brr
Alternatively though, you have four years to have an advantage
wrong, i'm a 10 and going to case
you can't deny im smoking hot
and how we're apparently all under a spell of self loathing
we're paying good money to hate ourselves
that would be a bad idea _anywhere_
i don't think a poll like that exists at case
yup, zuccbook wanted a place to rate chicks
i want to be done w hs
guess what
i want to be gone from here so bad like
@.fim. its true tho people who self loath are really unattractive
away from home
Finn looks like a man in a school full of gremlins
im wondering if i found the right acc or not
except for the one of my puppy
finn is crying rn
oh finn did u go to kenko's yesterday?
@kaori_flute i dont think so? whats kenko's 💀
oh its sushi
no i didnt lol
damn i thought i was unique :cri:
I haven’t had boba in a while
i told him "oh i want to double bme with music" and he straight up said "why"
asking why doesnt mean he thinks its dumb
he thinks its like gonna kill me

iidajsidjiajidjoajaweda owdajow FUCK
i don't know how to find one
u dont get it till school starts
"i need an ADULT"
I don't think that this is true
oh yeah adam said something on the lines of how case students have poor hygiene? damn
wtf
The gremlins do give us a bad name
if u dont eat it i will
i mean i asked my navigator about music majors and she went "oh lemme refer u to someone else cuz i dont know anything about that"
And either long blue or short blonde curly hair
if it makes you feel any better, i had blonde hair when i was a baby, and my hair gets curly when its short so you were kinda close
this is peak RA powers at work rn
I wish I owned Patagonia stuff. They’re actually a good company

Fair enough
He doesn’t even wanna be called prince
Ngl William though :ohgod:

I never thought he was attractive lol
yeah my grandpa had all his hair on the day he died
Indian men bald though :PensiveGIF2:
same but mine isnt dead 😎
I'm getting grey in my sideburns already at 21
@toomanyzs grey is one thing tho, losing hair is totally diff
grey hair rly isnt bad
dont ppl dye their hair grey
Man I feel bad for British girls then
my mom keeps trying to dye her hair
My grandpa had black hair til the day he died. Only his mustache turned gray
Mr. Clean amirite?
most of them dont 💕
fuck off
@howdy_. damn howdy i was about to
LOL im sorry 😭
@jellieellie women dont rly go bald...
shave head genius
no i didnt make that 😭
the whole thread is a fucking riot
If I recall correctly the trend of a few years back of women shaving their head for a gender cause was actually started by some trolling 4chan people
wtf
and so many ppl took the bait
Monday
dk who that is sorry
He went to Harvard then MIT then Harvard
No he went to MIT for his undergrad
oh fuck i meant to order grub hub so i could pick it up between classes but i forgot and now i cant eat food till like 2 pm :cri:
it’sok i’m gay
@toomanyzs arent there significantly more guys here...
Oh well, there’s always medical school!
Grad students are overwhelming female though iircc
rip
but how many gay people are there
its college, so its a higher percentage than usual
i dont even know 50 people
bruh how are u supposed to meet people here 😭
i dont like basketball or volleyball particularly much
i mean basketball seems resonably fun i guess
rip
i can’t see it from here
u need some natural light in there smh
Fix your attitude
i’m sorry
ngl i'm not even familiar with buildings so I can't even answer that
but most food places are like 2 mins away
and some are like 5 mins away
It really depends on how much of a whiny complainer you are. You can get to the airport for free if you want
that's fair
20 mins walk is close
ur gonna need a bus
i go for like hour long walks for fun, but still complain when i have to walk 20 mins for covid testing
Can work as exercise from time to time
RAs tried really really hard to get Linsalata turned into a covid sit
damn
In my boarding school I purposefully chose the farthest residence to bike everyday to class
Sorry, can you please tell us poors this in non-chad speak
Then fix it. Ez
but not really
OOPS I HAVE CLASS IN 5 MINS
Ngl I’m seriously considering bringing a bike but I don’t know I don’t want it to get stolen
Don't like the tire to the rack
so dont create the opertunity
Wtf
I might just buy one there sad tho
not really urban biking
Lame
there are groups that do urban biking, but i dont think there is a "club"
Just late for class
Ofc but their helmets are quite big idk
I have a midterm and Java project due tomorrow. Can we watch on Saturday?
I'd pay if someone keeps one for me
if you are serious about getting a bike tho, look up the ohio city bike co-op
they're all locked tho
Prob just one missing brake or tire and they dump them
something telling me jaffer has tried to "liberate" these bikes b4
I'd be so mad to get on campus and then there's none left
i took that like 3 mins before the deadline
I don’t like my *supposed to be* caseID picture
sad
but those are taken be a real photographer...
Eh still they don’t come out good
I never really liked my yearbook pictures
but idk how to just do it on command and have it look natural
I took mine in a hurry and it looks horrible and I'm reminded of it every week... it's especially embarrassing since I used to be good at photography
I've used my DSLR only a handful of times in the last year 🤡
they didnt question a thonk
Mine is terrible
*he doesnt knoooo*
I really don't know what it means, does it have something to do with bones? There's not much about it on the Internet
Okay, I just watched the video. "I was so busy being an 80s guy I forgot to cure it" 😂
One bad thing about a lot of the upper level classes is that you don't have much choice about who to take classes with like you do with classes like calculus, linear algebra, or differential equations
Haven't taken it yet
Considering taking it in the fall though
sigh
No pain, no gain. In my opinion, challenging yourself as a college student will be very beneficial for the rest of your life
Oh I wasn't referring to Gurarie's class, that one just sounds bad without any benefit.
Im not paying much. Except hours of my life and pieces of my love for applied math
That's dope, imma go for a masters in math
I'm already studying EE so that's some applied math right there LOL
which year are u, and which school were u at before?
3rd year now. Columbus state community college
cold > warm
i like when its cold because i can get in blankies but i like hot weather better bc hair up and warm clothes and skirts
i cant do that
too cold
i don't know how girls survive in the summer
u can fix that
i wish
but i cant commit
RIP discord
i hate all of you
Bro, if I ate before the exam I swear the mistakes wouldn't have happened
I have to work hard to even get a 90 or  above in calc lmao 😂🙃
ansh you have no brain shame on you
Shame
Imagine thinking 94 is a bad score
We all make small algebra mistakes on exams sometimes
I don't get it
Do you think he’ll get into a med school now that he only got a 94?
no med school
smh go fix your standards
Ansh needs to rise and grind
Nope
:cold:
:cold:
:cold:
A 94 is really good, if you can get that on one exam then an A overall should be very doable once homework is factored in
Looks like the Kim dynasty is still having trouble with those missiles over there
Leo Schnider is from 8:30 am to 9:50 am. Bruh, I should fix my sleeping schedule from now only then
Oh it is 8 am et?
Oh fuck
I think I'll be able to make it but RIP I'll be a zombie
oh shittt
I did that last semester for sages but I'm not the most coherent when I have to get up that early
RIP
I'm taking mini-music break now. I realized I still need to write one more page :cri:
OMG
It's boring
Coz I don't do the readings lol
Next, I need you to scold me every alternate day (Monday and Wednesday) saying DID YOU DO SAGES READING? OK @ishikak892
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQEDu8SPHao (This is college if anyone asks)
You would need Chutney with that 😜
@ishikak892 Should I sleep rn and wake up early or try finishing now only?
I'm kinda tired
Sleep now and wake up early
@everyone go to sleep
Go to sleep
Jenin go to sleep
I'm finishing up my homework and I'll go to sleep after I complete that
Math IB internal assessment
I'm so sick of writing lab reports
Starting a 15 pager on Saturday
Then starting another one on Tuesday
^how zhanda gets to class
Still working on this math IA 😢
this week has been so light for me that today feels like saturday
On the other hand, this week has been pure suffering for me 🤡
my suffering never stops
simply dont tell them
Tbh I’m not like _dying_ interested but i am quite interested
“Math and Brain”
just gotta get through the intro bio classes tho
I have to wake up at 8:30 am tomorrow and need to finish most of SAGES work and Bio HW today
Sameee! Finished math IA and stayed up till 5:00 am 🙃
There's a math and brain course? Are you referring to computational neuroscience (378)?
ANSH DO SAGES BIO MATH ENGR 145
ANSH DO SAGES, WATCH BOLLYWOOD MOVIES FOR 4 HOURS, BIO, MATH, ENGR 145
Bio is due 11:59 PM bro
my parents asked about my midterm grades and i wanted to die
the whole semester you didn't ask me about my grades
“Sorry I’m dead for the week”
Let me guess you had a 90 and you thought that was bad
fr tho
Midterms were so bad 😔
WHEN THE BIO SUMMARY SESSION IS TOMORROW AND I STILL HAVE LECTURES TO CATCH UP ON
Can someone pls delete me
When is your exam then?
GO STUDY
i have bio hw due at 5 but im plugging along
What happened to 🙃
DO HW FIRST THEN STUDY
I've never gone to the writing center lol
Ooh how is studying for the math exam going
they do, just mine don't ask me about mine anymore
damn
There's a stereotype that Asian parents are obsessed with grades
It depends. My parents are a little nicer. Like they want me to do well, but if I worked really hard and did not do so well, they understand. I already get mad at myself for them 😂
i think they have given up on me but just aren't showing it :sad_coolbutdepressed:
In imperial China one entrance exam determined whether you became a nobleman or a peasant
ngl that's exactly what my dad told me last year LOLLLLLLLL
oh no poor pri
Instead of the civil service exam, it's now the Gaokao that decides people's futures
Really?
bye
they haven't, but they expect me to be responsible and hold myself accountable
Same I get more mad at myself than them
im glad my parents allowed me to handle school shit on my own
Gaokao is only once a year though so there's not many opportunities to take it like there is with the SAT usually
Yeah my parents are actually really supportive when I get disappointed.
my parents got arrested in communist China during university cuz they just couldn’t keep their mouth shut
bruh my parents ARE actual indians tho
They went to China for uni - British colony HK unis were very racist
@raunakwastaken they just don't have enough energy for both my sister and i
they did when we BOTH were in grade school
So it pisses me off when people wave the Union Jack just cuz they hate China
Like that’s fucking dumb as hell
u got a separate hot tap and cold tap on each side
Fair enough
Separate hot tap and cold tap seems redundant
oh lol, back then it wasn't "the british are coming", its "the mongols are coming"
the reason they have sep taps is due to how their plumbing works. Cold water would b provided by the city, but the hot water was local, so to avoid contamination, they have 2 seperate taps for em
their water aint treated?
wasnt when the pipes were being built
It's not that they are contaminated, it's that the way it works, they get cold from public pipes and use different pipes to heat water in their home
i get a cold line and a hot line
for the hot shit, wheres it coming from if not the publuc supply?
Maybe so when they flush the toilet and someone is showering they don't get the cold water
Like howdy said they can have tanks that store and heat water from the public pipes, or they can also just not have tank but receive cold water, heat it and drive it through specific pipes only
It makes sense, mixing cold and hot water in one pipe is inefficient
yeah that's how it should work
to have a hot line and a cold line
but at the output a switch can join the hot lines and the cold lines
the plumbing would work the same regardless, so why have two taps instead of one with a hot/cold switch?
Maybe you just want hot water
and the reason there are two taps is cuz the hot water may not b drinkable
I guess it's like many things, people got used to have two from years ago and they prefer to keep it like rhat
however the cold line is straight from the city
when it comes to units it aint rly much of an issue cuz its just multiplying by conversion factors
Alp started engr 145 class by saying how a satellite literally bounced off the atm of Mars cause lockedheed martin used and kept imperial units while the rest of the satellite used metrics
while SI is more convenient cuz its just 10s, imperial shits allow for a better feel for shit
With imperial I dont know if my feet is too long or too short to use as reference
back in the day imperial units were pretty inconsistent, and u had apothecary units as well to fuck with lmfao
David's neurons have the (001) plane for maximum electrical discharge 💀
What if u let your nail get longer
Scientists believe intelligent life can only exist in 3D cause neurons need those many directions to achieve the necessary number of connections, while higher dimensions do not enable to solve the three body problem (stable planetary orbits) so basically we alone
so i can determine flow pressure, side shear forces, and frictional/head losses due to the various elements in a flow
i can shoot my nut a meter away
if i dont nut for a week, probably 1.2m might be possible
I remember that, I was bad at that and that was embarassing for me (still managed to get the one question on the final about it)
Wtf did I walk into
Wtf
Wtf
Should we move to cursed memes? Idk if howdy be mad later
I have things to say but I dont wanna make howdy mad
y’all need to calm down
im having an energy drink rn so i can go hard on some studying
@chandachan if u caught wind of some wild quotes from me last week
Wtf is happening rn
really?
only on thursdays though?
Oh wow, 40 people from UWC colleges got into CWRU for class of 2024?
Seems really high
Not many people apply either
They really are
ah that's sick
Ah yeah cuz he grabbed their shit
In South Africa there's a difficult thing with him, he donated funding for a university but students there hate him and his statue
I added my main argument tho
I have to be there by 7:15 AM. I'm even more screwed
No clue, this guy is a genius and I can't follow what he's saying
I won’t be able to come for today’s meeting
I've never been so clueless in my life
This guy is a BME major but he's also a math genius... imposter syndrome intensifies
Do you think we'll be able to do this by junior year
If I turn my camera on, I will be laughing because of the bomb
Maggie didn't send the email to him so I don't think so
Or leaving and meeting me at Leutner
I need to go soon
What class is that
Brainy math club, where I have the smallest brain for now atleast .
No don't
I don't want to present rn
GO STUDY @ansh8867
STUDY
What? That's insane so you're a professional singer then. Damn
3,2,1 bye
Anyways, bye
i forgot...
I'M DOING PHYSICS HOMEWORK, WHAT ABOUT YOU
some universities are requiring ppl to have them for school
It's not mandatory because atm there's not enough availability
Can't require someone to do get it if they can't get it yet
Although I can foresee a future where it will be required, there might be some legal problems with that tho, idk
A school can require it
Yeah they already have it required for Pertussis, MMR, measles, etc. I don't see how COVID is any different
except bill gates will microchip you and blast you with 7g rays xDDDD
oh rip
everything says
i was only gonna get it cause i felt like i had to ethically
that I dont know unfortunatly
i dont see why not
I think you should b able to
but i dunno how it would b in india
like u dont have to be a legal resident of ohio
Check with your country's government or local governments, we cant help you there
i mean i wont be surprised if its only for american citizens
u can steal my id if u want
Only SAGES left now
That's fair take a small break!!!! Then do SAGES!!
And I'm 2 weeks past my second vaccine
If you haven't gotten 3 pubs in Jama or nature you will only get into Caribbean DO
"The MCAT is hard and the MCAT is important"
It is hard
bruh I started getting those ads in junior year of high school
Did you get publications in JAMA tho?
I didn't get any pubs in Jama lol
tbh is there really that big of a difference between a 4.0 and a 3.9x in terms of med school admissions?
for the standard battery of vaccines given to children, it would be acceptable for those to be required, as those have been around for a long time, and have been thoroughly tested, so they've been proven to be effective
the covid vaccine's still a novel treatment so it wouldn't make sense to require those, but offering vaccines on campus is helpful so that people who are at risk can easily get one
Damn. One of them put their score reaction video also for the score on youtube
I don't think you quite realize that I personally know both of these people and I don't think either has a youtube channel
@toomanyzs Medbros channel is the shit
CWRU does not require undergraduate students to get any of those vaccines (except 
 for nursing students)
This is the wrong
I guess u r canceled now :pepecry:
But when I went, the owners were talking to us in Hindi and shit. Strange
Also Ansh did you work on SAGES yet???
there's no controversy if the idea is stupid to begin with
Denmark is going to start breaking up immigrant communities because they aren't assimilating to Danish culture fast enough https://www.voanews.com/europe/denmark-eyes-plans-break-migrant-communities
nope
how do i get transportation its 4 miles away
wasn't thinking
i want a vaccine 🥺
its a highspeed bus that goes down euclid
id rather let people who actually need the vaccine get it...
I just wanted to see if I get that brain emote lol
18 spots last i saw
instead of botanical gardens, we can go to wolstein
People's arm got sore and they say it's worse than wearing a cast
getting vaccin during midterm week oh fk
and some that had a headache at worst
Wolstein center is 0.04 miles away
zhanda right 4 miles away
14 spots left
i wish
i want to see them!
Just watched two geese fuck
Aren't you doing the math competition
@toomanyzs Needs it for his biol class
No sorry
I can't handle 5 am on a saturday rn lmao
and unfortunately my discord chat bot is not capable of mathematical reasoning yet
I somehow got up at 7 AM almost everyday last semester
man, idk how i managed 5-7 AM everyday last semester
You always looked some degree of dead during SAGES last semester
@zacharious go to sleep
@zacharious Dhananjay is crying in his sleep
Don't make him feel bad 😭
i litterally can't
i'm still working lmao
don't be like me
@everyone go to sleep
Same tho
So i thought the thing I got working 75 mins ago worked
and that took like idk another hour
now im jamming to "All i want to christmas is you"
I'm scared I'll oversleep if I sleep now so I'm just staying idle. It feels like there's no transcriptional repressor and CAP on my operon (brain)
i have work the day of the virtual accepted students night
how do you know when it is? I didn’t get an email or anything
I guess not but I could be wrong
nice millburns like half an hour away from me
nothing swollen just yet... I got it in my non-dominant arm so I should be fine
Na , the experience was good tho. Don't know about the results lol but Zhanda get the stress-levels balanced
We missed one question coz none of us knew what eigen values are
couldn't help you with that
Zhanda wanted to check his answer. He used some big brain method
Initial glance leads 7/36 but I could be wrong
wtf there's a whole softball game right next to my dorm
Well no I spent 2 minutes looking through possibilities in my head but I didn't write it down
But I might be missing some there
Yh, doesn't order matter tho
Nobel said that Dhananjay has never been wrong about anything
I don't think it's that complicated lol
You should be able to brute force this problem
We divided problems to save up on time
I ended up doing 5, Zhanda did 2 and David did 3
I forgot to subtract 4
but I don't know
No one. Dhanajay switched and paired with Maggie so even if they qualify, you won't be there
Oh cause on the other server someone said that a member didn’t show up
Yh coz Zhanda wasn't there initially so Dhanajay joined but then Zhanda came so it was still the 3 of us
Levent is a CS/math double major so he's really good at math
Once you know the concept, it's not bad
Bruh, how? You haven't even taken linear algebra
They expected you to know that. We didn't know but still
and scroll through pictures etc. There are many stories tho rather than posts coz it disappears after 24 hours or so
It's a bad username but david.frost was taken
Bro, they should have more of these math competitions and shit
They probably do. Maybe you should ask if there's another math competition this year
There's a math conference today
It ended 30 minutes ago
I'm bored. Come to general
I need motivation
I have something I need to do soon
I wish the audio quality was good
@ansh8867 MB Rao is a renowned mathematics professor in some circles and since he rarely presents at conferences nowadays, they probably wanted to catch a glimpse of him lol
lmao that's sick
@absence000 we had recitation yesterday didn’t we :))))))))))))))
Yeah we did nothing
I didn’t ✨
Because I forgot
It’s ok I just can’t miss anymore
I never used TA's help
I forgot to attend one meeting for a class last semester but the professor was very understanding (this was for SAGES)
WTF
Yh, Dhanajay carried a senior , who is the president of Math Club 🤯
Oh God, I have a complete lab report this time on ELISA for Biol214L. Need to find some research papers for that
I've done ELISA in ICrest but still
Omg how did the math competiton go?,,
I slept through it so idk
I’m getting mine tmrw
don't prospies get their results today?
i think i screwed my self cuz i applied to a scholarship and used a different email
so i want to call and ask if that’s the case but i’m so scared to lol
i’m scared :pensive_wobble:
this is preparation for going to office hours then
i wanna call but i’m scared 😭😭
I don't remember who my admission counselor was
apparently the registrar doesnt and i was very confused
literally took me 1 hour, depends on who the department is
i didnt call
that awk moment when the person signed my public health minor form and forwarded it to the person who sends it to the office but they haven't sent my form
it's been 2 months since i followed up with that person
My advisor took like a week to sign a form and then did it once I went to his office hours and he apologized a lot for it and explained that he had a lot of emails and forgot about it
Nice!!! We can cry together
bowls and plates and cups for college
im grabbing my old plates and cups for college
since my mom replaced everything :ohgod:
Costco even better tho 👀
i dont have a costco membership :(
Although Pandemic Costco kinda sucks
remember to bring soap cause absolutely no one in this fking dorm is competent enough to wash their dishes apparently
How was that video made? Seems hard to do that edit
omg
idk if this counts as a pastry but i make killer cinnamon rolls
Wrong
r.i.p. anthony bourdain
Rip to a real one
:rip:
Guy Fieri is from Cbus tho
nothing to see here
mayhaps, who wants to kno
I kind of want to
its as real as u want it to be :)
the 44th never gave me the handshake tho 😥
sorry they ran out of the exclusive invites
wanted to avoid an international incident lol
not without getting tackled by like 10 ss
zhanda dont u dare delete ur messages
My excuse is that I'm italian tho
or phone
Phone
I use it when I'm cleaning my teeth
I can’t speak Chinese either
That's on pc tho right
I downloaded Ankidroid on phone
Never used them, but they might be useful
His navigator doesn't know when Class of 2024 graduates? Bruh moment
Damn
yeesh that seems far
im long overdue for a glo-up
Zhanda and Ansh and Zhanda's navigator didn't know
unless you took a gap semester you ain't graduating in fall 2024
Just don't take his class
Only take it if you need to for your major
Many of us won't be able to finish everything in eight semesters
That's why you gotta work hard and pack your schedule so you can easily graduate on time
Apr 14 (Professor Alp changed date of exam to April 16)
RIP
Look to your left, look to your right, one of you won't graduate in 4 years
Why is it so low tho? I expected it to be way higher
well the mega brains do more school and the big brains drop out *and the smol brains die*
Lol, you're disappointed that CWRU's stats are not as good as Harvard's? What did you expect?
if u wanted to go to a pretentious school, case was not the move lmao
Harvard grading is not that hard
Idk one of the professors mentioned some people take an extra year because of the four+ one masters program as well
That seems more plausible
Just study really hard and take a lot of classes and you'll graduate on time
I took a January class + 17 credits in the spring semester and it's really tough but also very rewarding
That's fair
Don't most engineering majors take 18 per semester?
You'd be surprised at how much stuff like social media is easily cut out of your schedule when you force yourself to do extra work
If you have a decent amount of AP credit then you can probably get away with 16-17 credit hours a semester
Oh I don't lol
I prolly will not get as much from IB either tbh
Idk about that part yet, but we shall see
@ishikak892 I'm a Case School of Engineering major and I only need to take 12.5 credits a semester from here to graduate
I am I guess ok with taking more I guess
I took 18 credits last semester and 20 this semester
@sprinkles2108 studied 8 hours today
Mad
huh studying?
jenin i hate you
Yeah ik I guess I mean STEM in general. I mean even premed is really challenging as well as any Science major
we need her
I mean I guess that is still a lot compared to other schools tho right
Didn't see the other page
I hope I can survive BME alone 😂
I'm barely surviving one major, let alone TWO of the most difficult majors
I've finally caught up with all my work for the first time in 3 weeks... Time to move on to studying for bio
I was thinking of adding math
Oh you can handle that no cap
Alas, I'm still a boomer
no it's not but it doesn't sound right when I say it
And then I'll cry at times
It's a hardcore class
It's like getting a B in calculus as a math major or something like that.
If you get a B, assuming you get A's in everything else, you will still have at least 3.95 GPA
I'm sorry :(
Feels bad
It doesn't matter as long as you can sustain for your family
It will work out in the end. All we have to do is work hard and learn
Just put it into perspective. My dad initially struggled in engineering and had to work so hard. Now he is really succesful at Raytheon
Then idk where she went
LOL I have gone through it first hand
She got full ride damn
@quintus_fabius_ let me suck you
fucking shit up allows u to better figure shit out actually lmao
that's what practice problems are for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGU0kRRWy_w I don't know y but this was the shit some time
why the fuck is everyone bme
Because they want to be both an engineering and a premed student
ok his songs don't sound bad
wtf
please tell me we dont have to know that
You don't
nothing on my end to "do"
I never went and picked up my rta pass
guess I’ll go do that now zzz
Never been in the basement 👀
it’s where they hide dead bodies 👍🏼
is there  a class of 2025 discord
@_frostyyyyy_ Imma try using Ankidroid today for Bio study. I need to make more cards to fully explore the app
Sadly there is not much math on there but it's a motherlode for biology and chemistry and a lot of medical stuff
Once you get farther away from standard intro classes, there will be fewer resources available
What add-ons do you use on your laptop
You need to restart it to get it to turn to night mode once you enable it
It doesn't show preferences for mac
I memorized all of the common polyatomic ions very well when I was taking CHEM 111 because I made an Anki deck with them but I haven't reviewed it for months and now I can barely remember them
Well for polyatomic ions there really aren't that many so you can brute force memorize them
But you don't really need to memorize them
Without consistently reviewing your cards, you will forget the stuff you learned if you don't actually use it for anything
You can't go 2 steps in chemistry without using them so they never disappear from your life :smiling_gun:
well you can't do anything without them
I hardly get shit on Christmas now
So tasty tho
as long as it doesnt kill u i guess
I've had strawberry, peach, vanilla, blueberry, key lime, banana, etc. yogurt but never chocolate
then you've been missing out
when are we supposed to go back home?
never, you're stuck here forever :P
like last day of in person?
probably once classes end
After finals
Howdy do you not want to give finals?
I just hope I don't get a loose stomach from this. Unique experience ngl
a what stomach
Idk. Ishika had it yesterday
I've been planning to play MGSV for a year but haven't found any time
Every day basically last semester
I don't know what "enta malem" means and Google Translate isn't much help
Not bad. I think I'm done with my SAGES essay. Maybe, I'll put some more block quotes but yh
wtf
i wish they played this one
What the fuck
Here is some art from the last month
I’m not counting the days so idk if it’s the same as yours
OMG
omg
I can’t type for shit
@enby_barb put them on artwork to find them easier
as much as i want
Being fit for the 1700s or whatever isn’t much I think
yeah and he was 6'2 apparently
> George Washington
> Getty Images
> His resolve during the Revolutionary War was so strong that he enjoyed being shot at, once writing to his brother, “There is something charming to the sound of bullets.”
> 
> Washington would “return from many battles unscathed but with bullet holes in his clothing,” and “two different horses . . . shot out from under him in the same battle. This happened so many times that Washington admitted . . . that he could not be killed in battle. He genuinely believed this, and the crazy part? We have no way to prove him wrong.”
George Washington had a mean ass left hook
I’ll prove em wrong
I could take any of the founding fathers no problem
Who was the president who said he could be president and politician and all but also said that he wasnt able to raise his daughter? Something like that
I forgot
if you are feeling particularly shit
i'd contact someone as i dont think thats a common side effect
i do constantly get cold shivers. thats new
"The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain,** chills**, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose."
yeah sounds like your gonna die bro sorry
1st dose side effects for me: sore arm
I tried to lift a ladder after getting first dose. 0/10 would reccomend
2nd dose will be more tho probably
might need extendo arms
I’m looking at my arms rn and they look longer than 8inches I could get to his hair ez
I can barely lift my left arm
I have no muscle to get sore
Like with the Spanish flu, for some reason people think this is the first time a pandemic or vaccines have happened (I'm not saying it is your case). But for some other vaccinations they also carry most of these side effects (if they happen at all)
After all many vaccination methods work with a live vector agent (weak virus for example) so you do get infected and your body responds as usual fever and stuff but that's actually heavily dependent on your immune system, if u have healthy diet sleep and so on u less likely to develop symptoms
Pfizer and Moderna do not work using adenovirus
I guess maybe u get symptoms cause your body still reacts to the foreign agents
They shouldn't be at all easier to break apart
you lose greater amounts of mrna due to energetic inefficiency in transcription when going with straight dna viral vectors
Why rna vaccines need to be stored in colder Temps and have shorter lifespans
the flu vaccine
Flu is adenovirus
flu vaccine is usually like 40% effective
Experimental yet and more expensive
Flu has been for too long too many types
It doesn't even make sense to put "reading" there
I want to, I'm saying that one has been more tested than the other
would u get the other one if it meant u didnt have to wear a mask anymore
What are you worried about direct mRNA doing to you that live viral vectors won't
Don't work
ur scared of getting side efx? if anything those mean that its working
Once again, I would still have it if its rna ofc, fortunately I'm young and healthy but sick people or with conditions im not sure
This is a good study for efficacy
If efficacy is what you're worried about
As I said I think it'd be better for it to be mass producing the types that have been proven so far to work to ensure faster adoption worldwide
I don't know what to do
@absence000 Everything got screwed up when you left man
if you want a distraction from that, you can solve for the tension of an ideal string wrapped around trees 4 me
Its just sin tan cos or some bs
math is fake
its phys tho, so its all wonky numbers
If you had a zuccbook account you'd be able to figure it out
Cause people here wish each other happy birthday randomly
That’s enough trippiness for today I have bio already messing with my head
I'm really sorry guys for everything I've done or said that was hurting. I don't want a tarnished image of mine to continue. Again, I'm really sorry for my social awkwardness
I don't even know what's causing this but to all I've offended somehow, please forgive me
Also please dm me what's going wrong if you feel some animosity is developing.  I'll take that into consideration and don't want people to HATE me.
Damn the Holi celebration at Case my freshman year was so much fucking fun
Y’all haven’t experienced holi in India though😈😈😈
Sand on your hair, dragged through mud, etc. that's why I don't like holi too much
Next Pi Day is July 22nd so I don't understand why they would send a Pi Day discount now
They're trying to sell me a perpetual license
arent they a bitlate
Very late
its been 40 mins and leutner still doesnt have my meal ready :thonk:
O that happened to me once, they’re probably having kitchen issues
Its monday
no one is at either of the other stations
thats when i ordered tho 😢
probably still working on the steak line
Probs getting that tomorrow, miss being able to choose what kinda pasta tho
But i dont eat steak :((
i'd nab the steak tho since u need a special ticket for that
i'm sorry for ur loss (of this steak into my stomach)
Rip to all the cows Babs ordered to be murdered today
Her last order before she left lol
really?
Oh lolllll
its not my bday tho its julia's :thonk:
I missed out on the Leutner food
:0 nth wrong with that >:0
Fair but *just* mushroom? Bleh
You can always go eat somewhere else, you can never make up missed SI sessions
Ok that’s a bit extreme missing one SI session isn’t a big deal
True, I missed a lot of chem SI sessions last semester and I've missed some Data Structures SI sessions this semester. I was exaggerating for humor
I haven’t attended a single bio si session ever since exam 1
I don’t have mushrooms
u don't have-?
I mean I don’t eat
Obviously there’s mushrooms here wtf
some veggie ppl still eat fish
damn finn
"indian" isnt a religion...
im stupid dw about it
my point still stands tho
And wtf 1/4th are not Buddhists
and then finn gets mad when i say "baka" 
😔
@kaori_flute how would u feel if i called u small brain
were you scared?
i got food but didnt sit down
i looked around and didnt see u
aw im sorry <3
to be fair finn tried to take my drink by force yesterday
im stupid
hi stupid, i'm small brain
He tried to spike my drink 😠
true, i was quite off on the numbers, but the main point still stands which is that its stupid to assume indian=vegetarian
oh damn that was a good comparison altho the percentage of state congress peeps is a bit higher
really?
oh oops
But tbf if the Mughals never invaded India their influence wouldn’t have left many Hindus non-vegetarian today
The SI sessions for Data Structures are just amazing, 10/10. I would have done a lot worse on the midterm without them
SI sessions are really good and I'm jealous that every premed class has supplemental instruction
the answer is that leftists dont actually vote so it doesnt matter
call urself a sucdem if u want
run for office
Having 6 tho is more ideal
Just become an RA and never have to deal with it
How bad is it to get matched with mostly random people? I'm probably going to have to do that and I'm dreading it
I'm trying to form a group but I doubt that I get it beyond 4-5 people
u'll have other stuff to deal with tho :eyes2:
Worst case they all hate you and release eastern diamondback rattlesnakes into your room while you're in the shower
No, it was from something I threatened to do though to somebody that kept leaving tiny pumpkins like landmines outside of my door
Feels ultra bad
That was just such a gourd opportunity tho
b4 nobel gets hurt
Another prank that happened to me
I guess you got "scared out of your skin"
Sorry couldn't resist
you might be able to turn into a profit Nobel
after that class
u can handle any fish zach OmO
It probably denatures quickly outside the body
showing off is a pain
I haven't been out since the pandemic
I've  never done live fishing tho
oh no i have been found out
AWWWW
I feel like as a vegetarian, I need to somehow find some food with proteins
I guess there is soy and stuff tho
that is a valid concern tho
CWRU doesn't have A- grades though
So could I apply for lottery if I had a group of 4 where 2 people wanted singles and 2 people wanted to live in the same double?
i dont see why not
I'm just curious if that might fail the lottery
well clarke is supposed to b sophmores, as most of the floors usually are
I can't see why
Oh okay, that's good to hear. The website says there's a mix of freshmen and sophomores but doesn't say what the mix is
Or is it not available yet
the lottery isnt open yet
Well I guess that friend is not so secret anymore lol
clarke is the most mixed u can really b
Also, apartments for 3 4 for people near campus are cheaper than the cost of room for one person on campus, maybe something can work out for upperyears
cuz its so much cheaper
I would do that but sophomores aren't allowed to
case want u monies
I'm already getting offers from people to rent apartments together for junior year
By 10 months
You want to consider living together in an apartment in junior year?
No annoying people being loud
I closed it haha
Legit a few clicks away
Don't search on the ones that say ads
I wouldn't get a fancy page just cause they make an annoying website
i dont know
seems like a weird rule if tru
its like a work thing i think
Its like an internship but longer and u get paid
"Exposure" doesnt count
Don't do unpaid internships
There are enough paid internships that most students should be able to get at least one while in college
Oh yes if you can manage to get an amazon softwate internship as a rising senior, it pays pretty damn well
Well a lot of ppl that work in SF dont live there bc of the housing costs. A lot of ppl commute 1-2 hr every day
Most CS students can't get into Big Tech though... the kind of questions they ask in interviews are brutal
Lmao yes they have the money to pay for many very talented peeps to work on their products
Houston is good but as far as tech goes it doesn't have as many opportunities as Austin, San Francisco, Seattle, etc. It's a really good city if you want to work in energy though
lots of people here work in oil and energy
man idk how many ppl can afford mortage payments on a 1.5 million dollar home
however ~2k/month rent in a regular middle class american home is normal
if you wanna rent an upper middle class home tho, it'll be about 3k/month
idk where i'll live during my residency
i think med school has housing? idk. maybe not
30 more min til my sister's violin lesson is over and then imma go back to studying
ugh
One step closer to medical school, Priyanka!!!
You WILL get into medical school
this bio exam that's tomorrow doe :ohgod:
it's not terrible
looking at the content i don't think it's terrible i'm just a horrible test taker and read things too fast
It helps to just break it down and take a deep breath. I have bad test anxiety too 🙃
idk how i developed test anxiety in hs like i was fine and then boom one day my heart is racing during a test
My heart rate went to 120 BPM at the end of my Data Structures exam
like i already had anxiety to begin with, why did i need test anxiety too
It doesn't help that I nearly got a question wrong and redid it with one minute left in the exam
oh geez, i heard grades came out tho so y'all can relax and focus on your next assignments
Idk what will happen in college, but I just need to find the right way to calm myself before and during tests
Yes, now I can relax... I have **THREE** exams next week, two of which are math exams... I'm screwed
i just found out today that i have a psych exam this week that i need to take
i thought it was in 2 weeks
this week apparently
Not as bad as bio haha
My worst nightmares:
Sleeping through exam
Forgetting about exam
Uploading wrong work for exam
i don't really focus on my grades i just try my hardest
and if i don't do well
then im just stupid in that area and it iz what it iz
my biggest fear is forgetting about an exam
Omg imagine
If I forgot about a math exam, I would fail
i've dreamt of waking up on exam day realizing that i had an exam and i forgot to study
I need to practice many many many times
and then i literally dream of myself guessing on the exam
Luckily not exams
All multiple choice? 👀 I have several classes where none of the questions on exams are multiple choice (if there are only a couple choices, you have to write a short explanation)
but in bio it's hard to have an all frq exam
Linear Algebra surprisingly has a lot of multiple choice on the exams
i did that on my hs tests (back when we could touch paper without contracting a deadly virus 🥰 )
Omg this virus needs to go
i don't like online classes
We can't touch paper right now?
like i hate that i have to keep myself accountable for watching lectures cuz in person i would force myself to go to class
We should study in the library next year together to motivate one another!! I miss doing that stuff
That's fair
I liked it better than studying at home
i like working in silence
i don't like studying at home
Idk how it is at Case
Omg I get my vaccine spring break!!
so if you want complete silence
but group studying is for lower level floors
But if I study in my room, I lose focus
OMG lol when I want to possibly go to their law school hahaha
im 2/3 of the way done blowing thru a month's worth of shit for semiconductors rn
we got an exam this friday lol
Do most people store their textbooks on their laptop/tablet? Seems like it would be difficult to carry heavy textbooks everywhere
its like how writing shit down by hand helps u remember shit better than typing it out
You can get through the class without reading every part of the textbook. Go to all of the discussion sections, do all of the practice questions, do all of your online homework questions early, and read the book if you have time, and that should be enough. I would still recommend reading it if you have time
does anyone have the discord to the class of 2025 by any chance?
wtf
is this some dark secret shit
There's so much demand for Leutner food
Damn
it dont work david 🙃
@_frostyyyyy_ what phone u got
ye that'll work
someone showed me black mode a week after i got it and it was dope af
it dont work
I'm using it on my phone rn
After, I don't get access to Leutner then and I'm tired of Den
Oh, honey mustard
I haven't been to the Den in a while
how do you check how many swipes you have left
lmao I accidentally left my headphones resting on the "open up the discord help page" key while I went to get ice cream
@nobelium19 @sprinkles2108 y'all studying bio?
Yes, unfortunately
Not really
omg
i see it on my computer?
nothing of mine worth + im broke
I'm tired
Speed-running 4 approximately 2 hour long bio lectures in 2x speed
I have three exams and a CS project due next week so everything up until April 10th will be intense
I have to go through the double integral math lectures, do the assignment and lecture questions. Complete an entire bio lab on ELISA. Complete Chem Lab on STP Molar Volume Calculations and see ENGR 145 lectures
As well as Bio Exam prep
All because of the emotional drama the past two days, I couldn't even start
gl i guess
Anyone on south side want to tell me how many stairs there are in the elephant stairs?
i'm scheduled to get mine tomorrow and i stg if anyone says some dumb shit along the lines of "oh whoops we ran out" i'm gonna ruin Dwayne Bohac's political career
there are from memory close to 5-6 flights of steps
i dont want to be squashed by a toppling elephant
Oh, I just checked the Shoffstall Lab and one of my math homework group members is part of it
He sent me the background to see for Sunday's meeting. My bio Lab Report feels so boring compared to the research. Anyways, need to complete it by 11:59 pm
we'll be in our ugly clinical uniforms , cant miss us
I volunteered for April 10th. Can't do everyday
who doesn't
I don't watch Bollywood movies so I don't know who the most well-known actors in them are
jk jk ik a lot of people don't know who he is
I didn't know that many people in America watched Bollywood movies
nobelium is studying all alone
nobel is always studying
study with him
im hardly working or studying
rip
Valerie: "We're going to end early today"
Lecture: *1 hour long*
just finished tho 🎊
bad batch hype lets go
*tho im a fan of spaceballs myself*
me missing the bio part and thinking i had a lab due friday
I can't find simpler research papers to adapt my expt on
Lab reports were awful tho
In terms of work BIOL214L was more
yeah just proving this atrocity still exists
Fair but it was still easy
214 was graded really hard and 215 was chill
like I only missed half a point in all of 214L but now I've missed something like 8 points in 215L and it's raising alarm bells I never thought a lab class could raise
He didn't tell us if the grade for the new section was going to be separate or not tho
if it is then Pog but if not I don't know how to feel
oh no
not even april 1 yet
FUCK CREIGHTON THEY BEAT US IN MARCH MADNESS

THOSE POSERS COULDNT BUCK UP
WE GONNA NEED ANOTHER CASE OF NATTY FOR TOMORROW BRO
you know it is bad when zhanda calls the trolling cringe
WOAH BRO DON'T DISRESPECT ME AND MY FRAT BROS LIKE THAT
it's funnier if you present it completely seriously
just because you can doesn't mean you should
IM TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP AND YOU TALKING ABOUT THE VIRGIN CWRU INSTEAD OF THE CHAD OSU?
THIS AINT SOME AVERAGE OHIO STATE, WE **THE** OHIO STATE
RIP
IT'S 3 AM AND THIS VACCINE IS GIVING ME A PARTY IN MY TUMMY
fuck the vaccine
Nothing 400 mg ibuprofen, antacid, and a heating blanket can't solve
Yeah ik the area where you got the vaccine can be sore too. My parents experienced that
unless its the sort of sleep you don't wake up from
i.e. death
not yet
This took 3 times longer than anticipated
it is 3 in the morning my brain doesn't want to do math
cuz isn't it like 6am in cleveland
now i hate him
my dogo is now awake and trying to dig a hole in the floor lmfao
Wtf
I legit thought I went back to Feb wtfff
I was up until 2 AM working on math homework and then I woke up at 6 AM to start checking my work 😬
Damn it’s snowing again
What happened here...?
Ahhhh I forgot about that
I need to educate y’all smh
It's not an April Fools joke, university administration doesn't joke
It's a lot of work. I just submitted my 17 pages of homework for Discrete Math
I have written 20 pages of math homework in the last 24 hours 😔
oh shoot I need to do that too
THE MATLAB LAB DUE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDEDDDDD OMG OMG OMG
OH
Sorry I was too drunk last night to tell the difference
7-8 hours is still not enough tho 😳
It's hard to get all your schoolwork done and do a lot of ECs every week if you get 8+ hours though
I don’t think one more hour is the difference between getting you stuff done and not...
What ones tho
That's 7 hours a week just gone which is huge
7 hours of sleep a week gone is huge
i got 9 hours of sleep last night
even tho i wanted to wake up at 7
this isn't hs where you can be a part of 10 million clubs
You can't? 😢
i mean... it's college
Have to spend too much time studying to do like 10 clubs
I feel like in college there should more flexibility if anything
I have time for a lot of clubs but idk if I could find that many clubs that actually interest me...
fair but most college students I know are in like 3-5 clubs
College classes are very difficult though so there's not much time to do anything other than study
my issue is that some of the clubs don't communicate well
i think i'm in one more but for some reason i can't remember it
idk why
i tried to get involved with the Public Health Association with this one opportunity they had but they just wouldn't communicate with me
oh whale
there were other clubs i wanted to join but like i just couldn't find the time to go to their meetings
and if i wanted to join it i'd feel awkward cuz the semester had already started
i sent the point of contact an email conveying my interest in the committee they advertised and i was told i'd get an email with more info. i followed up like a week or so later since i hadn't gotten that email, and still i haven't heard back
oh well we're all in college so it's understandable
I'm inside Adelbert :cursed_flushed:
less practical tho
damn ive never actually been in the thinkbox building
its so much wasted space tho 😳
lmao wasted space dont matter if you have infinite money
Yeah, most state schools don't have very rich families compared to the top private schools
HE SEEMS TO BE LETTING IN ALL THE BAD VIBES THIS WEEK
HE GOT THE NATTY THO
@_frostyyyyy_ In case you were interested about last night, my 🧠 dad solved the diffeq but he still had to assume something
too bad that skill didn't translate
You're really good at math though, you were solving so many of the practice problems for the math competition
ZACH BRO, I CANT BE SEEING YOU REP THE WRONG TEAM BRO, CINCI GOT NOTHING ON US BUCKEYES BRO
Social sciences wants to look cool but unpractical, engr thinkbox practical but doesn't care about presentation
my english class is in there but idk if thats how it would be normally
i feel like a gopro isnt rly the best thing for this purpose lol
Not anymore
Or that's what they want us to think :eyes2:
I have a go pro enclosed in a frame, so the frame has an opening at like an inch from the lens of the camera, how do i know if I'm gonna see the border of the hole if it is 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch away from the lens????
Sure. I’m on my phone currently so I’ll send when I open my laptop
The email they sent to everyone a few weeks ago makes it seem like almost everything will be in-person
i didn't expect them to
Oh, so it's for international students who can't get to campus because of visa issues
fair
Yoooo the weather is fucking crazy
wow howdy is still doing it
they want internationals to pay up even if they cant come
they wouldn't make y'all pay for housing tho
cuz why would they
but yeah they won't decrease tuition
if anything they'll increase tuition cuz of iNfLaTiOn
ain't no complaints
Howdy has legit not said anything in lowercase except "ope" this whole day
we have broken howdy
case has broken howdy
I don't know how wide gopro lenses are
cause this is a wholesome server
CWRU >> any Ohio school
CWRU >> any ~~Ohio~~ school
I would very much wish to do labs in person, but I prefer online lectures since I can speedrun them
Idk but they usually give other specs like focal length and stuff like that so I guessed i could work from there
In person office hours are much better than virtual zoom office hours since it's personal
idk what i ❌ean
I a❌ so bad at progra❌❌ing
Oh
You ❌issed an ❌ in your sentence: I a ->❌ <- so bad at progra❌❌ing
They always say that, dont they. THE OSU
OH
Oh Eich! Ai Oh!
This is why I’m never gonna go into engineering
Oh my, someone else in Maya’s office hours today also had to use a potentiometer instead of a photoresistor
Literally Maya ran my code for question 1 and it works on her circuit but not mine🥲🥲🥲
wtf
o yeah i have a photoresistor (pack only came iwht 1 instead of 2) but im legit missing half of my potentiometer so I can't set up LCD display
The green light won’t turn on
So it works, but the light won’t work🥲
But not when I want it to
ngl im horrible with circuits so idk how much help i'll be but i'll do my best lol
wtf
Something is probably wrong but I don’t even know anymore
So before, it would just light up as soon as I ran the code like no matter what the button was doing
and never again
Now, it doesn’t light up BUT
if it doesn't light up then it's either the circuit or LED
oh it isn't working on your end?
nope
works on her end tho
OMG
ngl it sucks having a lab where the code is the easier part 😔
also my photoresistor works but my blue light won't turn on so woohoo another battle!
die
wdym... like they're stuck and won't come out?
yeah like i've had 3 cases today where i'm trying to set up a random circuit and they just get stuck and detach from the rest of the cable
The MATLAB class seems more difficult than I would have guessed, working with breadboards is NOT in the course description
this is the first semester where he's having us work with arduinos. previous semesters didn't have this
It’s seems more like an engineering class than a CS one
even last semester didn't have an arduino lab smh
given that it's an ENGR class i guess it makes sense
but didn't actually do anything with it
no clue, honestly it isn't that bad grade wise imo? (this is without them grading the midterm yet though)
from what i heard and experienced, it isn't terrible
Since they’re making premeds take this I’m sure it isn’t that bad
it's only pre meds who are either an engineering, neuro, or a BS in bio major
imagine tryna take this class while studying for the MCAT
i could never
yeah that's a fat no
rip yall
mcat doesn't sound fun
7.5-hour test whoop whoop
I've been so terrible at reading comprehension, same
the reading section was my worst section on the ACT and SAT lol
Terrible
Howdy's j gotta fix it now I cri
Omg
I feel the O state pride
Damn
Sold
Sold
AINT NOTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD BRO
nah i want a face reveal 😳
pissed
DONT BE PISSED
i dont even think im giving vaccines tomorrow
im gonna be doing like the stupid screening and recovery
wtf is this bs
Wtf is a natty?
NO NEED FOR SPEAKING BRO
i have yet to schedule my shot but im in line for it at my local pharmacy
BRO, DONT GET THE SHOT BRO, DONT YOU KNO THE SHOT WILL REDUCE YOUR GAINS BRO
YOU CANT LOSE YOUR GAINS BRO
WHO NEEDS CHIPS WHEN YOU HAVE GAINS BRO
after 3 hours?
sad
University administration doesn't joke
The meme page is mocking the idea of not having the break be continuous but it doesn't insinuate that the break is an April Fool's joke
someone u don't know :eyes2:
Yeah, I need to relax sometimes
My form of entertainment nowadays is scrolling on my phone and napping
I wanna watch Netflix but I’m always too tired to
For me it's not that I'm too tired but that I have too many things to do in such a small amount of time
You don't need your brain when watching movies
Inception initially gave me a headache but yh
@_frostyyyyy_ im sorry but i wont be able to join back for about 15mins. are you free then?
Isn't the ideal time after 4 years of marriage
Idk the general stats etc. Thought you'd know
Fact: if it wasn't for immigration, America's population would be in decline right now
Damn
Japan is pretty bad, it's like every year a huge number of people just died cause the difference of births and deaths is pretty big
South Korea had a decrease in population last year for the first time in their recorded history
@howdy_. what school do you attend?
Brain dead 🤦‍♂️Need Sleep Bye
OMG
Also @howdy_. we can't type in #academics🤓
I left requirement term blank
i forgot to fix that from yesterday
I did my major declaration form last year and I put Fall 2020
*well last year was 2020*
@ishikak892 I need some maha scolding today
i dont remember. maybe "huh" idk
RIP priyanka
bro honestly same tho 🥲
Is the engr131 project not due today?
nope. due date is extended to april 6th at 12 pm
Was reluctant to trust anything good that happened yesterday
that was so cringe omg
i want :osu: 😩
are there late fees :P
there actually aren't, at least due to COVID
u gotta use the ksl database to find a more specific database that you can then find articles from
Winston I didn't know you talked to dead people
needs a little brother named Celsius
and it was a damn raspberry chocolate morsel
TIL that Lubrizol is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway
Shouldnt they b working for the love of working david??
If they didn't pay them enough then wouldn't they go work for another university?
U cant have ur cake and eat it to
College president earnings are still nothing compared to what the top CEOs get
Obviously the answer is the cut all their salaries
No need to punch em when u got a tazer tho
There doesn't seem to be much information about nonlinear algebra on the Internet. Is it a lot less useful?
No more math
MATH 308 is intro abstract algebra, which might be closer to something like "nonlinear algebra". I'm taking that this fall.
Could’ve sworn I just banned math a few seconds ago
It's required for all math majors
Simply ban math majors and then bam
No math
Linear Algebra is a really good class, I feel like I've learned a lot in it
Too bad I can’t punch ppl thru the internet waves
Lotta fundamental shit taught there
it was after we ended 🔫
Now lab report left  😫
Plus I spent like 2 hours or so. An hour to Akansh and Zhanda
i just have my psych exam to take and one more soc quiz and im done for the week
cuz like
idk
But it doesn’t make much of a difference unless you’re buying almond butter or Jennis
still going down tho
now i want a bubbling hot cherry pie with streusel topping
Apparently, USG told them to reduce prices and they agreed
Everything there seems outrageously overpriced
dont you know
Feeling like star
But fitted sheet was never washed
I have another one saying let the adventure begin and the other one says miss you etc.
is this really necessary
https://youtu.be/Jvmmkx1dtmA u get shit like this from football culture
as i said, they felt the need to have an impeachment process for club executives
Well if u talking about "post war constitution" was supervised by the states, they didn't really care about details so long as it was written that they couldn't have an army and relinquish their legitimate right for war as means of solving problems
It is long wtf, case rocket team is 2601
The consequences of a failed rocket launch could be quite bad
It seems like not as bad as losing a soccer game
if I need to buy a $10 roll of wire it has to go through like at least four ppl
which, in terms of how much time it takes, is like half of physics I and II...
Partial derivatives is not too bad. The graphic understanding maybe confusing at first but the process is simple
It's not that it is hard, it is that it is tedious and dr*scoll makes us type all the equations
"I wonder why my computer is so slow"
i just checked mine and intellij is taking up to 2gb of ram
but for some reason its not taking much of my cpu
idk how yours is so much
I have actually never used a mac before lmao
except the OS is different ig
and hot damn that is expensive
im p sure the chip isnt called md but im forgetting the name
uhhhhhh wtf how do they charge that much for that
There was some deal in India. It doesn't get laggy or catch any viruses
They use hard grade titanium for the laptop so it's durable
It's probably the best gift I ever got tho apart from Sony 1000 xm4
@zacharious how much did your laptop cost?
My laptop doesn't have finger ID 😐
my laptop has that OwO
My old laptop (ASUS ZenBook) had a fingerprint sensor but on the other hand, it was broken in many ways like giving me BSODs frequently and having a flickering screen, even after ASUS replaced the screen
I never use safari tho
Since my laptop only has 8 GB RAM, I can't have 100 tabs open and it forces me to close things more often
My phone has 8 gb ram
Well I was trying to research if Steve Reich was racist for my essay and I just searched "Reich racism" :cursed_flushed:
Anyone wants to go to Mitchell's today
if not you might need to download some more wam
always need more detitated wam
My phone has 4 GB RAM 😦
I think 8GB RAM is sufficient for a computer
U ever heard this thing called a flight simulator
@speedbirdconcorde2 microsoft flight simulator?
have you ever used the flight simulator by dassault systèmes ?
Wtf
The solidworks flight simulator?
And is largely still based on Microsoft esp
ok here i a hot idea: program a flight simulator inside of solidworks
bruh there is already one inside?
Sorry I mean
Should have gone for music
Which makes sense. If there was an easy path to a good career, then everyone would choose it, and then it wouldn't pay well anymore
~~tired atm sorry kek~~
Nope
Couldn’t be me
don't have energy to study either :')
omg gib cofe
i now kinda wish i tried that cofe
@kaori_flute wtf
it has been more than 2 hours
i forgot 🤡
@kaori_flute DO PHYSICS HOMEWORK
I'm stuck in the Chipotle line rn :nkolostcrittycry: ALONE
i dont have netflix T__T
Sorry for bothering your combos on this soon to be holiday easter
Some friends (including me) are looking to complete a suitemate, we are 5 guys so far, and need 8
you could take bus tho
go sleep
Yh, I should. I felt sleepy for like 30 mins but not anymore for some reason
sleep b4 it's too late
the covid vaccine gave me pretty bad insomnia
ope rip
yeah! I didn't see you though
i was leaving then
Done with all math lectures from last week. Still lot of work
Just need to complete the assignment and 3 lectures behind in CHem 😩
This is really explicit
oh right today is easter
Not only do I not have a break, but I have 5 homework assignments and 3 midterms this week
OH
3 linear algebra homeworks, 1 discrete math homework, 1 economics homework, and second midterms for linear algebra, discrete math, and economics
This is probably going to be a 90-100 hour study week
i dont think ive studied 90 hours in my life
I don't even know if I've studied for 10,000 hours
have I spent 1/18 of my life studying? I think not
I only really started studying junior year of high school so
I was ultra stupid in elementary school (I got bad grades) so then my dad tutored me and then since middle school I’ve been on my own
But even then, I doubt I’ve studied for 10,000 hours
I don’t understand how people can study for hours on end every day
I can’t even work for 2 hours straight let alone a whole day🤡
find me study for an hour total in a week
I know Nobel does 80-90 hours of studying a week
Me too though
What else is there to do other than studying though?
I just want to be more social in college than I was in hs
Studying and ECs take all of my time
'cause this fails the turing test
I'm enjoying it, my only concern is that I don't have enough time to take all the classes I want and participate in all of the ECs I'm interested in
I think you may need to start prioritizing, nobody does all the activities they want to participate in.
It’s very hard to do EVERYTHING you want to
Sorry
Damn, the guy was driving
Need to do few training stuff with animals but I get to perform cadaver surgery on rats
Right now, he's working on the protocol for injectrode etc.
Can't be too bad. Spinal fusion soon
idk what i truly wanna research in
Cold called them
Cold mailed
But I work under a med student plus the Dr Andrew who both of us will work under is BME also. So I get flavors of everything ig
i cant believe that this is real
wtf
he isnt that smart then lol
Way too much anatomy knowledge. I was trying to register everything in like 2 hours or so
also wth howdy you didn't meet me yesterday smh
he's gonna need alot of simping for that
you still have it i think
i heard this story where it took a mexican immigrant 27 years to get his green card. the immigration system here is so broken
they probably dont care enough to track everyone
Clearly you don’t have a game
in the UK they did
the uk is smol
fair
howdy you didn't see my earlier message smh
simply go up to someone
Don’t try to nerd me
as sam said, marriage isnt complicated, divorce is
nah he wants you
yes he wants to marry ansh
Oh
Oh, I forgot that Ansh is originally from the US and went to India a few years ago
I don’t plan about marriage
Long term relationship plans when u not even in a relationship
That’s sad
that's fair
but it shouldn't be the only factor
Please Note : I DON'T USE TINDER
Yh or casual hookups. God, a computer software for relationships. fff
yea, u can be lucky and find someone u really like
Consider radiology. You need a lot of medical training to be a radiologist, but machine learning programs are starting to perform better than radiologists at their own job
astrology today doesn't come close to what it was in ancient hindu civilization
Isn't astrology considered to be pseudoscience?
Sometimes, I feel Mahabharata is a made-up story or many religious texts for that matter
Religion is a lot of work
@_frostyyyyy_ my grandfather's horoscope accurately predicted the time period he will die in. my sister's horoscope predicted that she will be talented in music and dancing. and she is
astrology nowadays is very decentralized and not as accurate but before it wasn't
A broken clock is right twice a day
There's a legend that the famous mathematician Gerolamo Cardano predicted the date of his death, woke up that morning still alive, and then committed suicide
still died lol
"if saturn was rly in her 8th house she'd be dead by now"
ancient HINDU astrology is a legitimate science. idk about today's crap from other people
yeah the astrologers today aren't that learned
yeah i don't trust hindu astrology today, i feel like to some extent it's cold-reading and tends to give the parents what they want to hear
i wish i could go back in time to see what ancient hinduism was like tho. would've been pretty cool
Astrology isn't treated seriously by the modern scientific community
@sprinkles2108 agreed tho
i feel like ancient hinduism would have been rly different and more liberal in some cases
yes, we know. like i said, our texts were destroyed so we couldn't pass on that knowledge so nowadays it's just guessing
The scientific study of trying to predict things now is covered by statistics, probability, machine learning, predictive analytics, etc.
Guruji was considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu so idk
because not everything was destroyed lol our vedic texts are still there
According to that Great Year model, those should happen in sync with the four "seasons" of the cycle, which each last 6,480 years
Perhaps in the Bible, God's covenant with Noah and his family through the burnt offering after the flood to never destroy the earth again is an illustration of our duty as humans
@speedbirdconcorde2 It Gon Rain
It gon rain
it gon rain
it gon rain after a while
Nope
Next year, the meal plans end on the last day of finals and they close the buildings the day afterwards
That's what I meant, for the 2021-2022 academic year they close the buildings on May 16th, the day after spring finals end
I guess I misread it then 😂
Still, if the meal plan is gone on the last day of the finals, there's not much reason to stay
it allows for people to have some wiggle room for getting back home
so i'd rather have the dorms not close the same day tests r over
Need to plan
its never /s
life is full of uncertainty you can't really plan out for 10 years
david
so much can happen in a year
u can't plan to exact dates wth
a little over a year ago, let alone a decade in the past, rona was never a thing
i dont even have tomorrow planned LMAO
i don't even have tn planned
david is bout to fail the turing test
Since I don't know yet if I should get a PhD, I'm not sure whether to do internships or summer research
I had to do so much algebra for one Homework Problem
Man I haven't watched Doctor Who in so long
bruh you got internship offers as a freshman? Damn nice
oh ic ic
i wasn't a huge fan
matt smith though? 👌
I don't think they were as novel as the Tennant and Smith seasons tho
yesss omg
My summer plans aren't finalized yet but by mid-may I'll let everyone know
If it all goes well though, then I won't be taking a summer class
They're supposed to be open for the summer
Damn the old @sprinkles2108 pfp hits diff
AHJAHA RIP PRIYANKA
at least he still wants to meet with me
cuz i really like tissue engineering
im taking 2 classes this summer so i can get shit done for my major
I'm going to do either summer research or take summer classes either of which I'm okay with
That and having really solid knowledge about how the gut microbiota to be able to manipulate it for medical treatment at a super targeted level
Because cells don't like to stay put when you 3D print them because they're soft
You need to reduce the effect of gravity on them to get the desired shape
cuz everythings accelerating uniformly
ppl there dont feel any acceleration
I was really sitting here for a hot minute wondering how do you engineer a tissue aka kleenex lmao
I took a photo of this wholesome muntjac today and thought reddit wholesome award so it's been in my head all day
it looks as as long as the dogo in my pfp
Yeah they're not much bigger than a smaller dog
wtf ansh
WTF
That can't possibly be a systematic name
@ansh8867 Holy FucK
@chandachan is know as a renown chemical engineer able to make his dickite crystals grow out of bounds
largest atomic packing factor
Of course plans need to be able to be changed for them to be of any use
Having a plan is like taking notes so that u will remember wtf is going on lmao
That's why I'm better at planning big picture shit than trying to haggle over minute details
The big picture shit is helpful to have written down and structured out
The minute details are like doing arithmetic, either I hash em out in my head or use a calculator for convenience
cuz it always helps to make sure of shit
Because it is bad
i mean im not a huge fan but i dont find it particularly bad
Priyanka, use SOURCE @sprinkles2108 . Cleveland Clinic guys don't respond plus they don't take freshman or anyone this year. I heard that from URS also coz of Covid etc.
i did but they're not from the areas i want to research in
also there aren't many entries
Is that bad?
im not really interested in that area tho
i mean i don't have adequate computational experience plus i like more hands-on stuff. not sitting at a computer and analyzing stuff
Me reading this as someone who sits next to a computer all day 🤡
The difference is that I'm developing carpal tunnel syndrome by typing a lot of code all day instead of actually doing physical work in a laboratory
Physical chemistry laboratory. I got a serious burn from 99% concentrated solution of phenol. One drop of it
School lab 😂
I've been gassed by chloroform before and had it eat away my gloves several times
Damn
I need to see clinical experience for fall sem there
Stuff that wasn't needed
Resumes need to be 1 page
Navigator says no one looks at SAT scores so I was like Ok
Same shit
Bruh aren’t they the same?
no not yet
CV is supposed to list everything noteworthy you have done
Resume is supposed to list your job skills
well i didn't list skills i just listed what cle clinic told me to list
my resume is a page but hardly, i dont have many achievements lmfao
She's correct, no employer wants to read a long resume that has a lot of stuff that isn't necessary
i literally couldn't
i tried
i hate formatting
i still have to chop more
my resume is also much different than what yalls would be bc im going/i went for nursing jobs
idk how people fit everything into a page
In terms of my own health, I focus a lot of my eyes and teeth because they're both bad 🤡
shoutout to the leutner drinks guy for helping me lose weight by giving me sparkling water when i asked for sierra mist 🙏
i didnt realize it until i took a sip
and you didn't notice it
another fun fact: soda is bad for you
I rarely drink soda because I know it's bad for me
Why did priyanka leave
Why would someone leave after saying WOOHOOO!!!! as their last message
Oh my
That's sad
Sad indeed
you cant just
leave the server
Imma cry
We know Raunak. We feel you
That was her catchphrase. I'm not literally going to cry, but this is a sad moment
I realized I got nitro yesterday, should I boost the 25 server since they only have 1 boost?
But it won't do anything
wait she actually left wtf
She really did leave and I don't know if/when she will return
Damn
started scanning and my phone just died :fedUpRay:
That happened to me also last sem twice
I waited until a few minutes before a linear algebra homework was due and accidentally forgot to scan one of my answers and only got a 4.25/5 on it 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Fortunately, I get to drop the 2 lowest homework grades
To say I'm disappointed is an understatement
I know, I won't let it happen again. I always check my upload but I waited too late for that one. I'm never uploading with 5 minutes left for homework again
The latest I've turned in an assignment that wasn't an exam was probably 2 hours before, I get too much anxiety otherwise
She won't mind
I did this with legit two math quizzes over time in 122 and got full
At the very last minute, I realized that I had done one part of the question wrong so quickly did it and submitted it to the TA
She accepted it twice and then said now I'll no longer accept it so I was more careful
I think it's quite likely I'll get an A in this class anyway so I'm not worried
actually, since pri left the server, the boosts she put are expiring
i dont care about boosting
I got :thonk: and thats all i need
gotta travel back in time to prevent priyanka from leaving to get back the server boosts
If you want to get boosted start partying
I'm so lost in life. This is the most unproductive I've ever been. I'm assimilating information but it's not going in my head :noBrain:
Idk. Maybe it's because I didn't do the chapter readings but I'm finding one section of Alp's lecture utterly confusing rn . This is the first time that's happening
@_frostyyyyy_ I will cry at your funeral because you are such a dear friend of mine :SniffSneezeTears:
doesn't ansh want to be a doctor?
Like the girl who wanted to be doctor, studied all the way and by the time she was doing practices noticed she was allergic to latex
RIP
The earliest I remember getting a jab, my brother tied a piece of cloth to my forehead and said I had to be strong like Rambo. I was about 5 and didn't even flinch with the two jabs 💪
@_frostyyyyy_ some girl broke the OnlyFans record by earning over $1 million in under 6 hours. How do you feel about this?
I personally would not spend any money on OnlyFans, and I don't understand why other people do
Rise and grind. Don't spend time on OnlyFans since that stuff isn't helping you achieve your goals
you'd actually want to sub
nah, I'll pull down my pants right now if you want
😭 y’all wtf
bro, you haven't seen how hard CS majors can grind
last time I checked they only metaphorically grind.
CS requires a lot of grinding. I would barely even know the material in Data Structures without going to SI sessions which take more take each week than the lectures
CS can't be more difficult than a regular engineering major right?
you clearly don't get it
dammit zhanda isn't responding to my urgent texts
He's studying rn. I just came back from chilling with him at Leutner
It is the only university on the country where having a better computer is more important than a girlfriend.
ha imagine having six people in one room without zach flipping his shit
i can't spell lmao
I wanted a smaller school lol
Dang case students got it rough huh, dunno which school I’m goin to but it’s chill
when Ohio doesn't have legal weed, so the students drink exorbitant amounts of alcohol instead
It’s decriminalized under a certain amt of grams tho
Who wants to have parties when u can have kickbacks
when i was 7 i had to get blood drawn to test for allergies and when they had to put the needle in me i cried and resisted so hard they had to call in 3 nurses to hold me down
and we're crying here. Fk me
@ansh8867 we're doing volume fraction type shit 😔
when i was a kid i was super obsessed with being as advanced as possible and i wanted to graduate early and all that
but lik eventually i realized
any reason doing shit early is better
@ansh8867 graham went homeless
How are you able to see what they are now?
this wasnt written by a native english speaker was it

> this just in, at the astonishingly young age of 12, a child has moved on from being a happy kid and has already progressed to being a sad adult with a corporate job
God created the heavens and the earth. Guess like we have some natural theology believers. He lost that round I think right
no he actually scored decently, i was like wtf lmao
Oh, I didn't see yet 🤫
what are the sock and door supposed to mean?
Because it's a weird thing to leave up in general chat I guess?
fair
guys, for many simple-type of door locks, if you lock your door from the inside but also keep the key in the lock you could keep people from entering, even if they have the key.
P sure suites are key cards, so that trick wouldn’t work
i guess i transfer then
but old storage rooms might still work :fingerguns:
sorry david
what if someone passing by drops it (asking for a friend)
Or if u prefer, make a door sign that flips over to “I’m fucking”
What if someone steals the sock?
cold email the whole undergraduate community
cause "im getting f*" could also mean you are preparing for an exam 🤔
Lmao. Wtf is going on. I'm speedrunning child genius videos rn at 1.75x
@ansh8867 Katherine's parents were on some other shit 😂
Yh bro. Not fair. Katherine is snake
what if the trillion people on this server are just like the guys with cameras turned off every class just looking at the ones with cameras on, getting an exclusive view of our private room knowing how we are while they just be silent.
me. I dont turn my camera on unless there is a need to
Nothing about shyness, but what do you need to see me for?
oof why did she leave
Jenin also left?
Everyone is leaving?
Priyanka told me that she left because the server is distracting her. I don't know why Jenin left
the end of an era
it was bound to happen eventually
Ppl will be bored over the summer
dam everyones leaving
Imma cry
Zachary don't leave 🙏
If Zachary leaves, my heart will be broken
leaving... what a silly thought
is nobel still on this server?
well RIP Zhanda
we need a pet
seriously though why tf can literally anyone buy that
how is this legal wtf
havent you seen amazon's taxes
you havent, cuz they dont pay any
but you can still get a tiger for 1/3 the cost of housing so
the :ope: emote is the only reason why i have not left the server
damn is it broken
do you want the source code?
oh me neither
I just copy and paste someone else's code and call it a day
nobel should talk to zacc tho
it's insane how human readable python is man wtf
im in the office
The office at Knoxville ??
If anyone is in Math 126, or even Math 125, may I get a PDF version of the Additional Calculus Topics textbook?
Priyanka left because the server was distracting her, I don't know why Jenin and Padma left, and Syberkonda, ZachAttack, and Jaffer left because it was funny
Okay so here’s what happened. Pri and jenin left cause they were distracted. The rest did it as a joke
Bye discord 😔
Horrible weather we’re having today
It’s fine on my phone Idk why my computer just decided to disconnect
Don't make Nobel have to talk to Eng
I can't reply in the case corona stat channel @nobelium19 but the reason for the super large spike in quarantines and cases is that two separate sportsball teams have had most of their members quarantined in the past week
There’s a groupme for finding suitemates. Have you looked there?
I was having trouble finding people when I needed more people but now I have people from that suites GroupMe messaging me after the group is full and I sadly had to turn them away
I did, somewhere in one of those forms, say something like"Requesting Single, due to KSL job"
lmao idk
O rip
You shouldn’t
Idk what's going on with housing then
Because life isn't fair
doesnt seem like it
Groups haven't decided yet though for Clarke
How hard is it to get a juniper dorm for freshman?
how did you get a room already :thonk:
so someone w/ a brain can do maths
I can't even submit my group application for Clarke right now, let alone choose rooms
He's a single applicant though
singles lottery apparently were today
So as a single applicant were you able to choose your floor?
Just noticed that on the Clarke Tower page with info about the man it's named after that they got his date of birth wrong
I just told em "I want Clarke, and that I want a single pls. I'm begging ya'll, i work for KSL, i need this"
Is it really that difficult to get a single in Clarke?
I was just really determined
nah im just lonely like that
If there isn’t you probs don’t have a choice
if I wasn't going to get a single I was counting on promising to bake blueberry pies for the suite
I want to get something close to to ground level so it doesn't take too long to leave the building
Slow mover?
I just don't want to spend time in the elevator for no reason
dunno, hit the google box up i guess
~~I think that’s cause A LOT of people drop the class and in the end there are more people like Nobel who get more then 100%~~
Needs boomer advice
I’m dad
Oh lala
Yeah just don't do them last minute
It’s so much work omg
how long do i have to drop it if i decide i hate it?
Up til final exam I believe
Case Western has a "freshman forgiveness" policy, which means you can drop the class without any W or any record on the transcript up til the class is over (which might be after the final exam, but don't quote me on that)
I think the last day of classes
Yeah it's last day of classes
But that's really late
i dont think it leaves any record
cause its not gonna be on your transcript
I don't think having freshman forgiveness will break my application, especially since I can just pull the corona card; the risks of them finding out outweighs any sort of "perceived benefit" from lying
to the world, the class simply never happened
I believe only 15 classes are required for it which means that even if you don't have any AP/college credits then you only need to take 2 STEM classes a semester
If you wanted to make it as easy as possible, you could just take 2 CS classes a semester and fill the rest of your schedule with easy 101 classes but I wouldn't recommend that, even if you don't want to go to grad school
ngl it doesn't make much sense for ppl in CS to go to graduate school
unless you want to swap fields ig
Still, there are some jobs like Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist for which a graduate degree is recommended
If into to java didn’t kick my ass
Fuck that man
but it IS NOT and intro class
First 8 weeks of the class covered all of AP CS A
then wtf you having intro in the title for
if you saying this aint for beginners
Even if I wanted to I doubt I could finish the ba degree in 3 years
I shouldnt have to had taken ap classes to understand this shit
I once again fail to see how this is intro
It suck at math too
I feel I’d like front end stuff a lot more
My Chinese chess project was kinda bad and the only reason I got a good grade on it was because the TAs were rushing to grade at the end
honestly, their plan is to turn ppl away from coding so their teaching is super ez
dont have to grade tons of tests if no one is taking the class
They need to watch out
They might just turn them away from the fucking school
they dont care
But idk how I feel about having to do public for like 2 years to get experience
Honestly don’t know what I’m doing with my life rn
while not having to feel full impact just quite yet
computer stuff, I already work in the tech field so if that dont work i can go do that probs
everywhere needs IT, cuz cs students are hopeless with fixing their laptops
Even most CS majors don't make 100k right out of college, I doubt that there are many people teaching themselves coding for 1 year and then getting 6 figures
Computer Engineering?
im doing EE cuz its more fundamental, and goes beyond cs nerd shit lmaooooooo
Is the computer engineering workload hard?
Don't many EEs work for big tech companies too?
i'd much prefer building shit than being a software slave lmao
hell nah, the prof this year is the worst
holy fuck lmao
We established the first computer engineering program and now there's only like 30-40 people majoring in it here compared to ~400 for CS and ~150 for EE
oh damn
they are trying to nuke it
The EE major can be tailored to be focused on computer hardware though which is similar to CE
for med school in general?
damn
Did you go through the whole class?
you didnt hear this from me, but stack exchange works wonders
Wish I knew that
but they shouldnt make weedout courses then
i took ap comp sci back in hs so that gave me credit for 132
im taking a semiconductors class rn (321) and its pretty hard, someone ik is taking digital systems design (315) cuz she's on the hardware track of EE, and she tells me it's pretty damn hard as well
Bc again, I ain’t built like that
the degree is small already, and case fills the line w/ a bunch of weedout classes and is currently working on merging it back into ee
fellas how do you all feel about your first year so far? personally i suck at everything online so i really hope i can get it back together when its in person
i did that once and the teacher called me out because i looked super tired
oh
zoom recordings are autocaptioned so thats sick
it just feels so like hard to pay attention tho? like im just kinda writing down what the teacher is saying instead of understanding it
its easier for me cuz im racing the clock
Oh, that explains it. Several of my classes have 50 people show up to lectures and only 3-5 people turn on their cameras and most people never talk to the professor ever
well i dont understand it regardless
i bump some wild music in the background and i go hard
you drop school
i was working on lab and forgot about the test existing
I just felt that this first year I was 70% of time busy and 30% of time extremely bored
I usually wake up 30-60 minutes before class but I sometimes wake up 1 minute beforehand
@howdy_. for the exam review its literally like every doc previously LOL but for more general the practice problems included : car on ramp going in a circle, pulley with mass with block tied to rope on it, bullet hitting a block attached to a spring, particle moving on circular parth
all stuff i dont know how to do
im cool with going crazy on the highway, i don't rly care much for school sponsored events aside from career fairs cuz i can have my own fun
oh howdy
do you want answer key to gavin's session
if anyone asks i never got it ;)
There's a chance that autonomous cars may become common before I have to drive myself everywhere after college
ngl i feel like couvalt is becoming more like "just be smart 4head" for applying the concepts
I once went partying just in a park, coming back home I was so scared because I saw blue lights and told my friends what the fuck are those bright lights and they said man it's almost 6 am
I gotta say, I've been shortly to the states but it seems that since everyone goes around by cars there's a loss of urban culture idk if that makes sense
What I like about being able to drive myself is that I got a greater range of places I can go to and experiences I can have
I feel scared of crashing, driving just seems so dangerous
simply dont crash 5head
I'm just not a fan of large urban centers cuz even tho there's a lot going on it seems relatively shallow
6head
note taken
Car collision is the most common cause of death for young people
I've never had a car accident, aside from one time when I accidentally bumped into someone in the high school parking lot, tho the damage was minor and my car received none
cant crash if you never drive
There's a reason why car insurance for young drivers costs a lot more than it does for older drivers
I think most of them happen on intersections and local roads cuz there's a lot more traffic and sharp junctions where collisions are even more fucked up
Highways run a lot smoother so when there's no heavy traffic, it's suitable for driving at crazy speeds
Fortunately I haven't been involved in any car collisions
I had one accident and got two permanent scars when I was a kid, I was on the frame of a bike, my brother pedaling, I wondered what could if I stuck my feet on the wheel
got a scar next to my eye and one on my ankle
SHIT
shit
It’s hard asf
It took me like 15 hours a week which is a very big workload for a 3 credit hour class
Rip
Apprently if one wants to do the biocomputation track for BME, they have to take it as a prereq
All of the math and computer science courses I have taken are relatively time-consuming
I most likely want to do biomaterials track, but wanted options
So my parents maybe suggested trying this class and I thought it would be a good idea but idk now
That's why if I took that class, I would have options in terms of tracks
If I did matlab, I am only limited to biomaterials really
Oh dang that's scary
I am taking an intro to java class at community college this summer
Idk if that will help lol
But isn't Connamacher the weed out professor
Rip
40 percent of students get an A in the class though
Shit ton of work tho
Yeah and hard working lol
I would say that Data Structures is the main weed out class for computer science. Java is the warm up. Java takes more time but the concepts in Data Structures are a lot more difficult and the grades for the exams are brutal
Wow that's amazing how you were able to do well! Yeah I am taking a Intro to Java course this summer at community college so maybe that will help idk
Oh there's a lot of other stuff besides just intro where even programmers could struggle
Yeah and he doesn't curve. His lectures are 10/10 perfect but the exams are quite difficult and the homework can be challenging
He gives some extra credit opps tho
He added extra credit on the final exam so most people I know got really high scores on it
I never took it much
Marks are lost in mid-term and some projects maybe
Ahhh I will be in person so idk, but my parents know Java really well
Do your parents work as software engineers?
You need close proximity with your parents
My dad did app development and used to work in Seimens in his late 20's so that's how he knew Java. However, he also said this would be kinda hard for beginners
Lol but I will be so far away... I guess they can teach me this summer 😂
Just took two math midterms today
ECSE is the Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering Department
For example, I'm taking Discrete Math, which counts as a math class, a CS class, and an electrical/computer engineering class
That prereq doesn't make any sense since calculus is never used in this class
I've used calculus more in linear algebra than in discrete math
Most of the stuff in discrete math focuses on integers and rational numbers. It's a very different class from calculus
If you decide to do the biomedical computing track, then Discrete Math is required
I think the calc 2 prereq is just to make sure that people don't have discrete math as their first college math class since it's very different from high school math
bro that sucks, let us know if you need anything 🫂
thanks! i think im good now, although im still super tired
yeah ive generally found that tylenol doesnt do much
oh fuck ur right
i thought it was like a pun or smt i wasnt getting
I heard for the java class connamacher has a set of 10 labs that just changes year to year so they're not the same, prob not much help from us
also i think you might be having a new teacher, from what i heard connamacher isn't going to teach these type of classes anymore
class structure will still be the same tho but i haven't heard that many complaints about java this sem (with the new teacher)
my advisor hasnt replied to me
@_frostyyyyy_ @chandachan not coming for math club?
Something unexpected happened that I'm scrambling to address
i dont see it anywhere
nope I have 9
these don't mean anything tho, I think they call random numbers
I don’t see
I don’t 🌊
the last thing under the "your status" page
it might b diff for northside vs southside tho
Kinda disappointed mine isn’t 69
goal is to find #1 and #69
I can't even enter the lottery right now. North Side group applications haven't even opened yet
He did just create a new graph theory class so maybe he wants to focus on upper level theoretical classes instead of teaching an intro class, so it's plausible
Why couldn’t be be gone last sem?
Isn't Ozguner basing his class on Connamacher's anyway so it's similar?
Connamacher is my favorite professor so far. I loved his class and he wrote a recommendation letter for me even though I was only 1 out of 250 students. He also held office hours all the time
I'm planning on taking Theoretical Computer Science and Programming Language Concepts with him in Spring 2022
I've heard that those classes are quite difficult but that they're really enlightening classes
@_frostyyyyy_ I got my stats prof to write me a reference for my BS/MS application, cuz for grad school u need 3
idk what stats u need to take but EEs need to take 332
There are some cases in which acetaminophen is recommended by doctors. My orthodontist told me to use acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen since I was undergoing orthodontic treatment and ibuprofen is an NSAID (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) which actually slowed the progress of the treatment
IDk this was specifically for the vaccine tho
Acetaminophen is thus better than ibuprofen for pain related to orthodontic treatment. It's dangerous though because it's easy to overdose on it and the overdose effects are quite bad
Damn
last i was in the suites tho, i didnt see a door
this seems to b wall
where did u find that
also seems wall
staley/tippet arent there smh
who didnt do them
fair enough
but apparently it means when you go
which seems EXTREMELY SUS
omg
i dont know
idk we pick at 3:00pm
i don’t understand bc aren’t like all second year housing places in suites of 6 people?
idk
oh
yeah ur right idk
u won’t even need a kitchen in ur dorm
a d then aidan went to go check mine and he yelled “UR NUMBER ONE?” and i felt bad 😳
yea but not tooo bad
omg
that’s sick
what one do u want i’m going to take it
i’ll probably lose it
i’ve lost my caseid so many times
but i’ve only ever lost it on me... i just forget which pocket i put it in
then i freak out and call wade like... has anyone turned in an ID and then find it in my backpack ...
that was a sad moment
I'm just trying to figure out which side is the east one
My friend lives in the same dorm as me except he's on the left side, his side was 85F while mine was 75F
Is South Side really that bad?
I assume you've been staying in a double alone in north side
Won't be as traumatic of an experience as me moving there from village
But it's gonna take u a few weeks or month to get over
OK that's prob better, but you prob gon be with a roommate next sem so rip to that
I'm okay with that, I don't plan to spend much time in my room next semester
Yea, I came to the realization after my freshman year. Most of the time my roommate isn't even there, I'm basically having the whole room for myself. Hence it felt much better than s side singles
Anyone going for Thwinge Study over thing
There was one ticket left for 7:15 to 7:30
rip, ansh, u go and get all the free stuff u can
Good shit
Damn it. I missed seeing you then
ye, lpt, you dont need tickets near the end
bro she aint here 😭😭
idk who ur stalking but margaux is in chicago rn
Dude what happened to zhanda
Nothing happened. He's alright
@ishikak892 I really need some solid scolding this week. I'm SWARMED with work with lab training also. I'm pretty sure Zhanda can agree to this @chandachan
Today's ENGR 145 recording is not up yet
Damn
I got invited to a doc from a dropped sages class:
Wtf is this class
GO DO YOUR WORK AND LAB TRAINING
Lol covid lockdown? The profile pic? Idk 😂
People going out to the beach without worrying about the virus too much
I'm trying to get a vaccine right now but there's nothing available near me
I mean I followed the rules for a whole year
I don't even meet my friends
I'm hoping to get one before the end of the month, I definitely need it before I go to campus this fall
I’m almost willing to go pay crazy money at riteaid
rip
I’m not trying to die in such a pathetic way Howdy I’m sorry
Whops sorry for interrupting
They open up my dead body and uneaten takis spill out
lmao her profile's the polar opposite of mine, cuz ive had this for many years now
I don't want to pay 28 cents per flap
oh I want to make this
I was thinking I can just make the PCBs and cut the wood there for super cheap
I don’t think making pcbs are cheap
oh there's an entire github thing
idk what I'd use it for tbh
I mean that's like $2000 for the modules alone but still awesome
I guess
Because I genuinely just went out with only my family and I follow restrictions. The mask was taken off at a distance so that we could take pics. idk what to say 😂
I have not gone to in person school for a year 😭
I wasn't accusing you of flouting restrictions or safety guidelines, I was saying that lockdowns in California are gone now
I guess!!
50 percent vaccinated tho!!
Sorry for misunderstanding 🙃 @_frostyyyyy_
Oh sorry I got that now let me ninja edit
OMG.....
ngl if an AI algorithm had free reign with learning shit on the internet, it would exhibit behaviors of autistic and schizophrenic ppl
I read that MIT researchers created a psychopath AI by exposing it to a lot of weird stuff on the Internet
Apparently they showed it gruesome images of death from Reddit
well, AIs are machine algorithms, they can't rly feel the same visceral shit that us humans do
Oh no...
all cuz they're machines
psychopaths tend to be generally unfeeling and egotistical, so machines which are trained off disgusting and horrifying shit would fit the bill perfectly
but if the algorithm had the entire internet at its disposal, it would act autistic when interacting with them, cuz while it's able to take in all that info and process it extremely well thru the neural net, the algorithm doesn't have the same human instincts and values which we do, so the wacky ways which it puts together that info would be like a person who didn't understand social cues and rules, which is a trait present in autistic ppl
I can't believe that researchers got the permission/funding to make a psychopath AI
well, it's important to test the "edge cases" to see what wild shit pops up for those
I wished covid would go away 🙃😭
don't we all...
I already told you about that in DMs, I just hope it works for my mom and my sister, cuz this is a novel treatment
I forgot for a sec 😅
That's fair
There's thousands of proposed treatments, but nearly none of them are up to spec when tested and investigated
i wish
lol i didnt actually lose much sleep at all, i just got woken up in a very unpleasant way, naps dont work for me anyways
they really need to stop fussing about it, its been a year, they should b used to it
gunshots aren't too surprising in any big city
im outside in the office rn, they came from east cle
i just hope nobody's hurt
Gunshots can be heard about a mile away
it's not too bad in East Cle
"Look Ethel, the commoners are out today, and they don't even have the decency to wear anything Dior"
east Cle isn't the safest though
it's worse than Oakland
never said it couldn't be
it's just an fyi to keep an eye out
you'd be surprised at how many people don't understand this...
my hometown was safe af but boring
Some of the most crime ridden spots are minutes away from people in Cali but due to the time it was settled and the money, it's so aggressively redlined
it's not a bad idea to have something to be safer with
won't stop a bullet, but it'll stop a knife
Damn
Damn
does the school admin really not see the issue with our student leadership being called coc
they have to know, right? theres no way they dont know
finn really wants to b w/ the head coc's
Bruh what's the point of sending out a security alert 2 hours and 20 minutes after the incident happened
Someone got carjacked
just cuz they legally have to do it
doesnt mean it helpful
they dont want it to be helpful
it doesnt specify when they have to do it
It is helpful lol, they’re letting u kno that something happened around campus, that’s the point of it
long after its over tho
Because it doesn’t concern us
but still doesnt mean they arent delaying w/ the info
It wasn’t a student as a victim, there was no threat to campus
why dont they just warm us about the crime before it happens...
whats the point of knowing if it already happened
There was this one time where they sent it out 2 hours late and I incidentally went walking in that area when the crime happened
but past that the info really isnt super useful
30 minutes wouldn’t work even without cops moving slow that’s still an primary investigation timeframe
For my next trick, I will make popcorn without setting off a smoke alarm
Why do people here hate business?
Business is a solid field and can provide some good returns on investment. It's not great preparation for doctoral work, but if you're going to stop at a bachelor's or master's degree and you don't plan to work in academia/research, then I don't see what the issue is
no it's because it's called "Weatherhead School of Nursing"
people can major in whatever they want
it just was a meme i don’t actually mean it
isnt closer to like 80yrs at this point
Zhanda left ? That's sadge
It just seems people that left were also regular here so literally is now less distracting
cuz
What, do you want to get invited? 👀
Jk RA's pls don't ban me from housing
Courage the cowardly dog
he do b cowardly tho
I emailed a professor and he used an idiom I've never heard before: "a different kettle of fish"
Idk, I've never taken one of his classes. Here are his RMP ratings
i don't like this
Oh
damn
Professor Thomas also told me that even though it is not a prerequisite, there are some ODEs used in MATH 380
uh oh
my schedule's gone funky
For me: CSDS 281, CSDS 310, CSDS 338, maybe a math class like MATH 303 or 224, and finally a SAGES, hopefully a USNA
TuTh 10-11:15 AM is just cursed for me. This semester, Calvetti's MATH 307, CSDS 281, and CSDS 302 were all at that time. Next semester, MATH 380, CSDS 281, and CSDS 393 are all at that time.
None of those classes are very difficult though, CSDS 310 or MATH 303/224 would probably be the most difficult and those shouldn't be too bad
rip
17 credits shouldn't be too bad as long as none of the classes are very difficult, right?
you also need to have backend and frontend experience
Oh yikes
I took 18 credits last semester and 20 credits this semester so I'm already used to this kind of workload, but it's definitely stressful
I definitely understand why most people don't want to take 17+ credits though, it's very unforgiving
I can't, it's in that cursed time slot of TuTh 10-11:15 AM and there are two other classes at that time that I prefer
Oh
Yeah, sorry about that. One of my exams got rescheduled to be after the hackathon and I got worried about ruining my sleep schedule
not sure whether I should take MATH 380 or CSDS 393
393 is an endurance race instead of a sprint like hackathons are though so it's a different kettle of fish
Damn, it really gonna jump 10 from this lovely weather
I had a similar issue where the Zoom tab of Canvas wasn't working and turning off my adblocker fixed it. What class uses Echo360? Only class I've had that used it is MATH 122
math 122 and phys 121
I'll see if removing my adblocker on canvas will work
Yeah I don't know why, it was working fine until recently and then the adblocker started blocking it
what the fuck david you scared him
I bet he has a fear of robots that's why he left
i’m still 17
i need more context
i didn't get that
oh ikr
You know what I thought about doing it but I won't
because it feels like it
who wanna go flip a car w me
they have the wrong C
noo dont tip the cows
AHHH WHAT THE FUCK
i never specified which outside
arent there bears out there
You're the one who got pranked. I've been sitting outside the whole time
HOWDY WTF
you were supposed to say bataleship galactica
rip
good shit
That was my Shit
I remember there was a plane one
i didn’t like when they started to introduce a bunch of weird characters
Oh man it gets so wild when they do callbacks
Now I want to rewatch :so_hot:
zach if what ur typing isn’t total drama island related
please don’t chime in.
I do not need your sass
cant believe you didnt know
fuck cwru this is a total drama island fan discord now
oh he’s a celebrity my bad
isnt that the goth one
since this is case western, such short names are nor permitted
not long enough
oh so the schools got married
pain.
I bet I won’t be allowed there for the first year 🥲
By the transitive property, I will die alone.
my sister lived in mack hall at osu with her roommate that would leave food in dishes out to rot😍😍

I'm going to make it my goal never to buy anything at plum market
cant forget those eggs, now can you raunak
With casecash you can still buy from plum if u wanted
david bouta have a really boring diet
Isn't there a lot of stuff at Leutner that's healthier and has vegetables?
well tofu can go hard
So I get to choose between spending more money and having a bad diet
Damn, there's a lot of tofu on the Leutner menu
ezzie cash money
If I were less lazy and didn’t hate walking I’d be eating leutner more
made to order tho, and its next door
Won't have to spend much time at the gym since I'll be running to each class
if one scoots hard enough, any amount of scootering is possible
zach have you never rode one???
I didn't know they were called that
the electric scooters are used if you got money
or want to toss them in a tree
besides that, i dont see them get much use
I noticed that Case Western is one of the campuses supported by Bird but I haven't heard anyone mention them
far too rich for my blood
Then you kill ur fingers cuz they get pinched
that's sick
since they got the hole in the middle
You haven't even set foot on campus boy
i'm gonna need all the answers in about 10min
Yeah fim offering answers to another sultudent is a serious crime, you should be ashamed of yourself
I'm worried that if I get the vaccine right now then I'll get my second dose right during finals week and feel bad for a while
Aren’t they open for 16+
Oh it’s diff??
I mean it doesn’t depend on the vaccine itself
But yea we’re not getting the American ones. We’re getting the UK one
Isn't the FDA currently reviewing it?
The problems are very minor tho
I think FDA stopped jj
They’re not even getting paid for this I wouldn’t be working nearly as hard
I think it’s just a list of things the pr committee can and can’t post
I’m talking about the initiative tracker tho
what they trying 2 do?
They’re still working on lowering plum prices
My plan is never to buy anything from plum
Like if they aren’t at uh or clinic main
RTA is already covered, so paid uber is I guess their plan
Seems like they’re trying to work w a car rental service
Honestly I went to the Aldi today and their fresh produce selection was just as sparse as plum
rip
Why are there so few grocery stores/supermarkets close to campus?
I was coming back from tric metro so I just stopped on the way back
like grocery stores near me are convenient because I have access to a car
farther away
few minutes to drive tho
Because I need that
We can’t all b skinny legends
They’re also trying to do a campus wide water balloon fight??
theres so many ways it could go wrong
except instead of missles, we got water
but then you lose out on fox news mispronouncing ur last name for 8yrs
nah ill still keep my last name
Oof I joined this server last year today (19th)
I joined on October 5th 2020 so I was late
why would you want that tho
idk, you tell me
isn't the origin (0,0)?
That seems like the best pe class to take cuz it confers important general knowledge
I already lift heavy shit so I prefer doing that on my own time and dime
:rip: me
LMAO that happened on monday for me gg
oh um treasurer
2 hours, 19 minutes remaining of 4/20
n:ope:
I did it already and my hands smell like fish because we caught 240 fish
is it hypothetically possible that you caught some, put them back, and caught them again :closethonk:
they did it to save money
no need to pay for rubble and destruction when it's already there
This is that scene where he throws himself into the sky isn't it
can you say he's wrong?
*which museum, don't you know cleveland is a cultural hub???*
No it is one of two chambers of the heart that receive blood
I haven't taken E&M yet but maybe they did 3*0.8 = 2.4, 5 - 2.4 = 2.6? I don't think the other stuff adds up tho
Dang, Nobel is somehow solving E&M problems without having taken the class
ohm's law comes up in just about everything science related if you look hard enough
Nobel used backward induction to see what actions had to be taken to reach the conclusion
I still have to take PHYS 122/124 💀
@_frostyyyyy_ i dont think physics 122 will be that bad for u tbh
it might be study intensive but
the labs are kinda stupid cause the TAs take of points for random bullshit but they aren't actaully that big a part of the grade
Yeah, the exams aren't what's scaring me, I'm worried that those lab reports are going to take an eternity to write
Tbh that's really not that bad, you're going to need them all for BS in CS
For me that's a bit bad
the solution is to simply not do the report until the day they're due so you're forced to spend an appropriate amount of time
Someone stole my juice from the fridge. Uhhhh. F for my Simply Orange
@_frostyyyyy_ or sometimes its turning in shit 1 minute before the deadline LOL
damn lmao
bruh what is this physics homework
uh oh
Why are students tolerating the fact that no physics homework is graded? Is the instructor aware that nobody is getting their grades?
its so we can pretend we all arent big chilling with an F
I can see why they made the homework due on Tuesday
For most of my courses, the instructors release homework solutions for almost all homework assignments before the exam unless it's a very recent homework (like maybe only half a week before the exam)
the homework solutions are released on time
Oh
In that case, you should be able to determine if you're doing well by seeing how similar your answer is to the solution. What confuses me now is how they plan to get all of the homework graded in a month if they've barely graded any so far
@howdy_. I can pay your entire school tuition for you. All you have to do is 
1) pay me the money that would have gone to your tuition 
2) find 5 other CWRU students to make this same deal with me, each of whom will pay me the money that would go to their tuition
3) then I’ll refund the money you paid me, plus I’ll pay for you’re entire tuition free of charge
4) the five students you brought to me will also each have the same deal, where once they bring five more students to make the deal, I’ll refund their money and cover their tuition
never ;)
nope
I'm not allowed to explicitly say what it is tho
~~once I accidentally doxxed someone here~~
oh is someone from there here?
oh the server is no longer on nitro'
who wants to spend $144 a month on keeping us at level 30
wtf
we never use it anymore just :Thiccnos:
i will run for usg just to eliminate casecash, its the stupidest shit ever
those are on stomachs apparently
as engineering majors we know this shit well
i dont have spotify
my life has been too boring
unfortunately
don't be a major - be a minor
i don't need ur sass adam
zach this is the only time where context isn't evil
oh there he is
nvm automod is still on...
what words aren't allowed
!weather @everyone
-weather @everyone
oh
idk what the game is but ok
this'll be a fast game rip
oh nvm
oh we can stop whenever
I have to get back to my jazz skills homework
aww you too get a double card and I don't
hit the minus button to leave
CAH Game expired, too long without any actions or no players.
oh shit we got AI for that
so remarkably close to victory all. Just 2.5~3 weeks
Yeah, we are so close to finishing this semester. I'm really looking forward to a break after this year
Proof math. A lot of it
math 324, 322, 307,
its just pain
All of the PHED classes except for the varsity sports are full
damn now i have to redo my entire schedule
no PE class means mornings open up which means opportunity to get other classes out of the way
So there's one class with 8 seats left? Yikes
I don't want to talk about it regardless
idk is it a disaster?
It really isn't that bad, you can just take SAGES next semester
I'm just going to swap discrete math and USNA and take USNA next semester
Yikes I can't take discrete math with Shuai Xu because it directly conflicts
Yeah well his reviews are worse
I do not recommend taking a class with Fidalgo
which i really dont wanna
don't worry, you won't die if you take Fidalgo's class
Wow I can't take 281 either because of class conflicts
I can't, NEUR201 is offered same time and I can't get around it
isnt 281 being offered at multiple times?
I have to take go in person at 9:30 am. That'll be hard
nobel we will miss you
i dont want him to take the class with us so he can so questions for me
That's gonna be hard 🤔
I was going to take 1 CS class but USNA is no longer available so I'm pushing 1 CS class up
Honestly not that bad, depends on your professor though
Everyone taking ochem should be fine tho, as long as you do all of the book problems while reading & practice maybe 30 mins - an hr a day or so
That class is basically death in person
Ive heard stories of people just breaking down and crying mid lab
sounds horrible
o shit
yeah I hate this about lab classes so much tbh
coz I'm speedrunning it in 5 weeks
Are there going to be any tests online tho?
The MOOC course is closed now since 17 people registered for it
damn
i dont even know what i sent
but still
that may be an office of admissions question if you want a numerical answer, most of us are just here to grind on our classes
and they said that i can still get in for fall, but as of right now im guaranteed a spot in spring
oh i just joined my bad
Yeah sorry sometimes I open shit and forget to reply
i don't think you can choose what you get
would recommend. I wasn't super interested in the subject, but i still found the class enjoyable and not too difficult
Does this class fill up fast???
How does it work
Were there upperclassmen in that class
Or was it primarily a Freshman class
uh i think it is mostly bc they want students to have better access to their profs
Is it hard to get FSNA sages classes first year
My navigator is leaving CWRU and at the end of his farewell email he invited me to connect with him on LinkedIn
Rip
Navigators are helpful in that I need them to approve my requests for things like credit overloading
They can't help with course recommendations though, you need to talk to a major advisor about that
most humans don't do credit overloading
Oh
the moment your plane lands I'll be blasting it 🫂
the moment my plane lands I'll be blasting it
its anyone whose taken the class and gottan an A
I'll miss Aravindan, who named his cat after daal
Although we had to sit through it and ask questions else 10 marks goes away there only.
Doesn't matter
It affects your GPA still even tho it's 1 cred
So even if you bomb the lab reports you still end up with an A
I still can't forget that shit
that's a negative decrease wtf
bruh he didnt ask for your grade
and just a heads up, dont post your grades here
@absence000 his grade dropped from 98.33 to 98.27. do you think he'll get into med school?
Ok, I won't but I swear it was in reply to the F. Only verbal communication then in voice chats (Understood)
i did not though
It's excitement. I won't share it
ah shit where is the weird champ emote when you need it
I'm hungry
I didn't eat anything since morning 😫
just didn't find the time and needed some documentation for summer app.
Side note: Bragging is kinda like flirting: You don't plan for it and it happens instantaneously 😂
yeah I tried talking to it but it ran away
the IRS wants his 2020 taxes
I wish I could use that strat but I killed my roommate spider:(
Im a prospective student for the class of 25
wasnt decision date yesterday :zoomeyes:
well there are no sages classes with spaces for USNA the one I have left
just kinda wanted some perspective from real students for my situation
only reason im here vs elsewhere is cuz this was the cheapest option
esp since between most schools, the classes are about the same
*the exact same if the profs really dgaf*
if you had to guess
probably the national average, where you go for undergrad doesn’t matter tbh
plus, work dont care where you went
really
my dad hires people and legit doesn’t care about where people went to school, he didn’t go to a “good” school so
i mean like it isnt rated very well at all
ratings don’t mean anything
if you’re getting a cs degree employers won’t care
if you wanna escape arizona tho
and itd feel like a waste if I went to ASU since I couldve gone there without doing anything
we have decent weather
just remember that what might’ve been a safety school for you isn’t necessarily a safety school for others
i’m from nj, the cold is gonna get to you
im from az so I literally have no protection from the cold
miss curious george you’re screwed 💀
mostly nj or ca i feel like
new jersey sucks‼️‼️
unfortunately. Try again next year
ik ik, but never too late to become a robot
oh shoot really
idk how much my family makes but my dad works for a university in ny that pays for 50% of my tuition, minus scholarships
so tbh they don’t pay as much for my education when compared to my sister
im not 100 sure what I want tbh
my parents could prob pay 40k
seriously don’t look at them, they’re completely arbitrary
oh this is fax
money?
seriously consider the climate if you think anything below 70° is bad
philly gets extremely cold
a *tad* late for that
but if you do end up committing here come tour over the summer
another thing to consider is that cs majors make a lot of money out of college, but are you willing to pay the loans? because they also accrue interest
I think 40k in loans wouldnt be too bad
you really need to think about the financials
is 6 figure loans really that bad lol
nonetheless debt is debt, you don’t know what’s gonna happen financially to you in the future
you don’t wanna be in debt
bruh, i dont think i've ever seen 6 figures in my life
its hard for me to judge this honestly
i mean my dad does finance work and $40k is a shit ton of money
90k is def worse than 40k
like, 50k worse 😁
quick maths
and its not hard to make like 120k out of school
seriously
once again, father employs people that do business—they’re not paying someone straight out of college over $100k
gas money, oof
but like if I put 2k away toward the debt
you can’t rationalize it
you'd be 38k away, with then 4k of interest
except you are rationalizing it 💀
42k away
lol i mean im trying
I dont think getting a job at amazon from an ivy is too hard tbh but I might be crazy
deadass i got a lab job in nyc and i’m being paid min wage, they’re not gonna pay you $20/hr 😭💀
it doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed any of this, it also depends on your resume and grades
that doesnt guarantee you tho
nope no buts
I shouldnt necessarily look at the worse possible scenarios to guage my decision
except you *should*
that feels like limiting my potential
Consider all possobilities, both good and bad
ik it does but seriously think about the worst that could happen
remember, when something has the potencial to go wrong, it will
idk i’m a fairly cynical person, but that just might be the whole premed thing—you always need to have a plan for when 1 thing goes wrong
like i was told to have a plan b career-wise just in case i fell on my face
tons of premed kids never go to medschool
i am aware, i’m just saying that you need to have a plan b in case plan a goes horribly wrong
seriously consider the finances
ik i sound like a basic annoying bitch but
If I need more time cant I just pay the enrollment deposit for both schools
i mean losing $300 doesnt seem bad at all in the grand scheme of things
its 300$ that you no longer have
yeah and there are people here who could barely afford food and could use the $300, you need to think about it and realize that this whole process is a *shit ton of money*
idk i’m a twin so maybe my concept of money is different but i digress
on of the profs here,  went to a school in bumfuck nowhere ohio and graduated with a phd here
where you go doesnt matter
because my parents are paying for 2 college educations at the same time
i mean I want to believe this but like
Man, if you somehow got into harvard, but were stuck under so much crushing debt, it wouldnt matter if you went to school with elon musk's kid or something, you'd be trying to make ends meet still
it. doesn’t. matter!
but this may be totally wrong
he went to a college in bumfuck pennsylvania
need i elaborate more or do you find it necessary to refute my point
then do it’s not that hard😁
*Sooo* many people have told me that getting into a good college is important
Like ive never had a real salaried job or anything
a good college, is one that isnt pragerU
just because someone has a degree next to their name doesn’t mean they know more than others in terms of life experiences
lol how do I know which ppl dont have a clue and which do tho
Finn's also like: "once a upon time I wanted to be a child genius, now I'm just doing diffeq on hardmode"
you won’t
also harvard like by definition cant be a scam cause they give u hella money if u need it
the school you go to doesn't matter much when you start working
@qareeb The physics lab instructor went to Mount Union (an unknown college in Ohio), but she graduated with a PhD from case
workforce dont care if you went to buttercup angel university or harvard, they care wether you can help them make more money, to fill their pockets
grad admissions need to gage whether or not you’re capable of handling the rigor of graduate school
you’re killing me here
the guidance counselors are especially full of shit
@chandachan the issue is i need to reread the major requirements each time
I literally dont have an argument
I just dont know what to believe bc literally everyone has such different opinions
had a lil chat with her parents about school
and each school has a differnt cost/benefit
they told me the guidance counselors here dont know shit about transfer credits
its a bunch of looking what you want to prioritize
oh shit i need to get back to my CS project
oh yeah finn don't procrastinate on that man
yeah im trying
too late
no it literally takes 4-10 minutes
zach is in all the math classes
i told u, i need to figure out what classes i want based off the reqs
if i knew what classes i wanted already then yeah its like 5 mins
sorry 😬
well finn, doesnt ur major have the suggested classes or whatver
ill be stacked on some methed out math this fall
damn
damn alright
i still takes time tho
that is uhhh a lot of math
esp cause i wanna double major
damn we have no classes together :/
u already took EBME 201?
cuz Gerald Saidel is retiring after this spring
wait how do i find the prof for a class im not in anymore
damn
oh you know what i could do instead?
helll to the fucking no
so u dont have to
its req for math major
yeah i don't
ik methed out math majors need it
would it be bad to take abstract and lin
u seem scared of abstract zach
but for math MS u need to take more abstract alg
abstract math kinda cringe tbh
discrete math kinda based tbh
*studies math*
not all math
methed out math is the shit
like wtf is a structure dude
they're just fucking wack
i dont get it
oh shit i took a group theory course over the summer and hated it
nope
but idk it mighta been the structure of the course? to me it seemed like all the concepts were super simple but they were wrapped in tons of annoying and unnecessary syntax and terminology that made it really annoying and hard to understand
idk if i wanna do that shit again
honestly maybe im just tired of learning
uh idk abt that
lol that shit can stay with u
i dont think thats my problem here
yeah ur looking at shit the wrong way
fuck
i dont wanna do it
altho idk i haven't taken them
that's the higher math core, like the EE core
oh fuck
uh they can count towards your hours and GE's i think
i took that evolution class for nothing
i took engr 145 but it counts for nothing since they changed the major reqs for CS
i forgot that i transferred my high school physics mechanics class for credit from the AP test
can i switch what that class counted for
Which class
Oh I wasn’t in that one sorry
should i assume that i can change it or that i cant
if there b space, i dont see y not, you might need to email somone tho
literally also fucking math classes count for that section
what the fuck
am i actually stupid
that was literally the most pointless class ive ever taken
i dont need to worry about PE classes yet right
also email would work you could go through old emails / canvas notifications
oh this is prolly easiest
that would b my first step cuz the prof might not b teaching that class
didnt like the prof
bad reviews?
not bad reviews cause then i wouldna been there in the first place
she just seemed to have very stange (bad) ideas about philosophy
that just like didnt make any sense
don't expect shit to make sense or not be wack
no it wasnt that tho
it wasnt that it was wack
u said it didnt make any sense
was it just *wrong* to u?
must be an awfully long laundry list of shit
on like the second day of class she made this argument that being altruistic is essentially a once in a lifetime experience, a very large thing, that happens in like-or-death scenarios or things of that nature. and the students in the class, especially me, were very skeptical of this claim, so we brought up various examples of small altruistic acts, such as holding the door open, not playing loud music in your dorm room, paying for the food of the person behind you in line at a fast foot drive through. and for each of these examples, she insisted for some reason, that those actions were in fact not the result of altruism or caring about other people, but just a result of a social contract, for example in the case of not playing loud music in a dorm room, the rules of the building. of course, she refused to accept that lots of people play loud music in their dorm room, and dont have any consequences for it; i could easily do the same, but i choose not to because i dont want to annoy people. theres no social contract at all. but she couldnt accept that for some reason
i dont even like philospohy and that doesnt seem right
oh i forgot the best part! according to her, the "three rules of ethics" are free will, respecting people's rights, and not killing people, (and most philosphers would say that being selfish is ethical)
not that it doesnt exist, just that its super rare and everything small is a social contract
i don't like being trained into mental drifting so i wouldn't consider this a good class to take
unfortunately philosophical bullshit often is mental drifting lOL
also it was lowkey hard to understand her sometimes cause she wasnt the best at english (not her native language) and i dont rly wanna go here cause like learning languages is hard but like u need to be 100% spot on with the subtleties of language to have a philosophical debate
although i have a lot of problems with the way its normally taught
you do not want to live in a society?
fuck
finn when are you waking up tomorrow 😬
i still have no fucking clue why i took engr 131 dude
for pain purposes
as far as i can tell it didnt fill a single requirement i need
i dont know why i took it
fucking apparently
i didnt need to spend like 15 hours on this class
oh man
guys can someone help me out?
i cant find "To Be Announced" on rate my professor
idk
Damn you guys were up late
which class?
also can i just say im pissed at whoevers decision it was to put the "delete" button next to "enroll"
5 mins to go
I emailed my navigator but I still ahve a hold apparently
RIP
Navigators can't lift holds, only academic advisors
4 mins😬
was I also supposed to email my advisor? It listed both my navigator and advisor as an advisor on sis
thankfully all my classes I need have a stupid amount of slots
Uh oh
SIS super slow
mine is stuck
Well a shit ton of people are trying to enroll at the same time
couldnt they have overslept
Oh boi I'm still waiting
mine isnt even loading now
I got in OS and probability tho
Except physics
Bruh I didn't get OS
wtf
Oh boi
Damn probability is still open
Theres like 3 seats left
Its still open
Wow I got everything again, thought it would be harder since I'm on school wifi
I got everything except OS
Lmao how is the lab still open tho
Probability enrollment seems low, maybe people are avoiding Thomas
RIP
damn well ty
If you're a transfer and you don't have any credits already earned then unfortunately that's why you can only register starting tomorrow
it's like an upper div math class
Because the math department wants to get CS majors to take more math classes
class request permissions go to the respective proff right?
Will they still be providing lecture recordings for classes?
I want to take two classes simultaneously
I could take MATH 330
cause the class is still chilling in my shopping cart. its as if i didnt send a request
Since Ozguner's Algorithms still has plenty of seats there's no way that Koyuturk is letting me into his class
that David really wants to take it with him
Only one university seminar is still open: Polar Regions in History
damn professor, you got the whole class laughing
screenshot taken on one of those slow days :p
Oh my
My alarm didn’t go off
oh no
does the alarm just switch off if you dont wake up?
fuck
that must be what happened
ive never slept thru an alarm :/
oh man
cuz it penetrates thru all frequencies in ur hearing range
Just explain you're a math major and you need lin alg and you should get in I think
I feel ya finn, I woke up on time, but i had one of those blink and suddenly 30min have past. thankfully all my classes are still massive ones
why am i getting the ban hammer 😐  i didnt know
still answering the question tho
havent had my morning chocolate yet, im bound 2 b cranky
Is that bad?
pain
idk i like stem in general but honestly at cwru so far my humanities classes have been more fun
evolution 225, what did you take it as? cause i took it as biol 225 but i dont actually need a biol credit, so i want to take it as like HSTY 225 (i forget if thats an option) but basically i want to know if i can change its credit retroactively and what the options were if you know
idk who you talk to but it can be done
oh epic
yeah i want to take it as that then
how are we supposed to finish all sages by second year if there are so few classes
a: you dont
Oh weird
Math 307 is proof-based and for math majors
Lol wrong reply I think
Math 307 is really good
The professors keep saying that linear algebra is the most important area of math to know right now
the website says that cs majors need to take 207 so imma stick with this
Oh man
But I don’t wanna take the easier one
If you don't like the proofs in linear algebra, you're gonna have a bad time in abstract algebra and analysis
Oh no
Also, 307 is required for math majors
Idk I don’t mind proofs normally
I just didn’t like that one class
Linear algebra proofs aren't difficult
Except for the time I was stuck on a Cauchy Schwarz proof problem for like 3 hours
you litterally can't
307 is required for you math majors
i dont have to make a choice
finn is a math major?
were we supposed to keep the card they give us when we get vaccinated
there is probably some procedure to replace it, but rip
what do u actually need the vaccine for tho
@zacharious You need some sleep
I got 2 hours last night
oh damn i sound so dead too
Getting 2 hours is bad, but at least you didn't miss registration and got all the classes you want
Missed my BIOL 215L
I tried to pull an all-nighter but felt really drowsy at 4:30 am
Got up at 11 am when there were only 5 slots left in 2 of my classes. So did some makeshift registration, where I only lost on BIOL 215L
rip
It's so hot. How are you guys living in your dorms without dying from the heat
the school?
It hasn't been really hot this semester yet
Yest I was dying around 4 pm
8 am to 11 am finals wtf
Bio and EBME course doesn't have any final timings tho
MATH 303, CSDS 281, CSDS 310, CSDS 344, ENGR 398, ENGL 398
Names: Number Theory, Computer Organization, Algorithms, Computer Security, Professional Communication for Engineers
How are you taking the departmental SAGES seminar already?
Diophantine equations was my Math IA for IB. It required a bit of number theory
I hope ENGR/L 398 will benefit me to take, cuz I'll be looking for some engineering-related work in 2022/23
it cant be warmer than india
damn
holy fuck this vending machine is shitty
it took me $3.70 to get a bag of chips that shouldve cost me nothing
the card scan is "disabled" so i cant use case cash, then the first time i cant buy it since i overpaid and it only accepts exact change, and wont give me my money back, then when i come back with exact change, it does the classic vending machine thing where it doesnt unscrew it far enough so i have to pay again, hoping that ill get two, or at least one, and i get the original one, but the second one is even farther from coming out
damn
add on another $55 to get rebates on the shit u buy
BAD BATCH RELEASE
we got cookies but i wasnt there
i wish  a great day to everyone but a specific math faculty
brain dead simple
rip
damn
wow, i guess they should've not given the execs a raise this year
yea. apparently  case is in a hiring freeze
they didnt give bonuses
that is why there are 2 calc3 classes that dont have a proffersor. cause they cant hire anyone rn lol
the hire freeze is till may so maybe so the 2 classes will be assigned someone very late
thats why they want ppl back on campus
so that they can get money from rent on the dorms
i recall sophomores and juniors couldn't live on campus
Where did you find this?
oh, not raises
It would look horrible if they tried to raise their pay during a budget deficit
The last time CWRU had a budget deficit was before Snyder became President
how'd they lose 20 mil in the spring alone lmao
Coronavirus is wrecking financials for universities. Other than the bull market since April/May 2020 which is nice for their endowment, everything else has been bad. No university is safe from it. Harvard went from $300 million surplus to $10 million loss
A lot of graduate schools are accepting very few people right now because they don't have any money
aww look universities are struggling
I'm crying for them yk
as they continue to rip us off
No shit it's a business, I ain't pretending
The primary reason for people to go to college is so they can get a higher paying job
I listed the primary facilities that a college should be equipped with
Yep. Nobody is paying tons of money and studying hard for 4 years just for fun, it's because it's a necessity for most careers in the modern world
Nice! They mayy be performing a work of mine next year, but I've never met a single person in the orchestra lol, except a friend of mine
bruh that would be sick
Doesn't sound like the wisest place to spend ur time if u aren't doing it for credit tho
If I join the orchestra I’m only gonna do the boring percussion instruments :cri:
Which I’m used to but still I cri
i need to take lessons over the summer i’m so rusty 💔
Over summer I’m gonna get bad again because I don’t have super expensive marimba to practice on 😔
Not a bad idea
What happened to the picnic tables outside Raymond?
They’re gone
I forgot to register for springfest, but it's on Freiberg field so I highly doubt that they will check for registration
oh I thought it would decrease
since the area increases faster than the length, so resistance decreases to cancel that net positive increase out
Did it specify  for a cube tho?
Oh man, I just considered the length damn
oh I just assumed it was getting bigger so used the resistivity equation
I thought area would remain constant. Damn
4 marks gone :SniffSneezeTears:
my econ professors baby is crying in the background
This happened all the time in Discrete Math
The Discrete Math professor teaches his class at the same time his wife teaches Differential Equations which is difficult for them
damn
I'm not able to call the people
I have an appointment tho
oh
i had diff eqs with her last fall
didnt know she was Xu's wife
math geneaology?
There's some Kantian philosophy discussed in our Sages texts but our Sir doesn't like Kant's views
Damn. I registered a week ago tho
rip
Someone who was the advisor of your advisor's advisor's .... advisor
It's really killing me. I don't know why I can't do it
I didn’t get it
This is what I feel when I see Alp's final exam
I'll try. I don't know if it's burnout or just the extent to which the class can bore me at times yet be interesting
Plus my instructor is damn strict when it comes to grading. I need a flawless paper
Last time, he said the paper was slighty under-developed for it being 0.1 pages below the page count
At the end of the day, there should be equality, moral way should be followed despite some monolithic societies in existence. After all, we live in an empirically diverse world and have the ability to reason so should be open minded but not be too tolerant or intolerant of other's cultures. Some diversity is good but not all diversity which can be evidenced by Nazis not living with Jews in one community. The gender structured society needs to be broken and become radically liberal enabling autonomy with a balance of heteronomy in human decision making. Feminist theorists advocating about how woman are entrapped in poverty stricken societies but don't know so because of the domestic abuse, lack of education , and low caste/ social order.
We can follow a minimal version of human rights pertaining to human good and Aristotle's flourishing but the shit discussed in 1980's books still occur today. Be the change that you want to see instead of giving your viewpoints about how change can be instilled
Yeah I’ve never heard of that either
I can’t tell if you’re being fr Nobel😂
He's serious
Nobel ik you are moving back today, so when you google it make sure your parents haven't arrived yet
HOLY FUCK LMAO
yall are moving out before the finals?
I’m moving out DURING finals
I'm never moving out
Stay here till 30th with the spring extension and then 5-weeks summer housing in Clarke
Work on your SAGES assignments
Just think of what will happen if you don't
I have 3 more pages left
:Gundma:  do your finals
they kicked me out unfortunately because I didn’t have an orange wristband
they didn't deserve you
there are still spots for 900 if you wanna go
i signed up and may go if im bored
ope, sorry to hear that man
The system sucks
But we couldnt watch
ah shit
Cause wrong time slot
Yeahhhh it sucks
ranauk will i need a wristband to get in?
FUCK
fuck i forgot the u didnt i
sorry man keep yelling at me until i do that
Nobody has kicked me out yet though
you shouldnt have to sneak in, U PREFORMED THERE
Na, it's a distinct yellow color. Don't think that'll work
rip
we all left together and I wasn't re-kicked out
My average laptop usage these past 3 days is 12 hours. Damn
you can also look for scholarships that are for students trying to work through college aswell
sorry
no worries m8, I wish you luck
you dont need a car here
and you can walk/bus/train anywhere u need
We can't even see the concert. 👎
rip
Damn, this is sad. She's had some rough history
It's so cold outside
in that you dont have to do much
6:55 am in India tho. How Raunak?
wtf is happening
i just left
i dont really know her
they rip it from 4+ grades of students each year
they shouldve got drake or eminem or someone
they would prolly charge in millions tho
wtf
atleast you arent those people
How do people feel comfortable putting their names next to those comments?
If this was a real concert, it would be worse
Is it me or is this kinda sad?
i'd take sad over the extreme levels of simp cringe that cam posted
I really really doubt that
i dont
I can still see their names
She admitted she hates herself
Yh, she said this song is for people who hates themselves like me
Adam don't you listen to radiohead 😒
does anyone wanna listen to death metal in vc with me
$10 to whoever pastes in the chat "can't beleive the school paid 80k for this"
im sorry but what?
wtf is this simping
i have too much money and not enough dignity
"this song is about hating someone who loves themselves" okay wtf is going on
"lets hate other people, arent we all chumms"
this is some emo shit
I would lowkey walk all the way to Tinke if it was this guy even if it's damn cold
9 or fuck off
9 and a hug
How long has this lasted so far?
@chandachan fuck this is like radiohead
wtf is this
I would but I don't want to get in trouble
no nose goes
The end is here (Our finals)
phoebe bridgers is gonna blacklist the school
"everybody seems to be vibing"
I was laughing so hard
oh no
there are no questions tho
aww man they're vetting the questions I think
"how do you feel that you made more money in one night, then some staff do in a year?"
I'd listen to her songs if I'm reallllly sad
This Maddie hates her
never
How did you manage to get it all? Copy and paste? For some reason, Zoom isn't allowing me to download the chat like it normally is
its probably cuz its disabled
She's struggled a lot tho
See, you dont have to be smart to be rich, you just need to command an army of simps
damn that's hard to turn down
this simpin needs to stop
i need the benjamin 💀
hot damn
you suck at negotiating
These questions are taken from the Internet
no, the fuck u cant
fuck you howdy
zach fuck you
nah, fuck that
damn adam
cuz ik thats far from me
Hmm, that wasn't so bad
I think the worst bit is
Oh god I saw that and didn’t know if it was me
But if anyone except phoebe bridges posted that I will be sad
seriously though I wonder if the college will investigate that chat
there was so much weird shit happening
So what happened at Springfest?
I was going home so I missed it lol
Are any of them at 8 AM? Since you're in the CDT time zone, professors can't force you to take an 8 AM EDT final, so you could maybe ask a professor with an 8 AM final if you can take it at another time. Another option is asking the registrar if they can reschedule some of your exams
What? But one of the exams date was precisely at 8 am
Talking to the registrar's office is a good idea since they're the ones who are supposed to prevent 3 finals in one day from happening
fuck sending joke ones in is such a good idea why did i not think of this
dont
Really?
Cause it’s Elon Musk
elon musk literally sucks?
I didn’t watch it
ptf but elon is a terrible public speaker lmao
Doesn’t he make up everything on the spot?
Damn I didn’t know ppl hated Musk that much jeez
Fair
and there was like one other skit that felt like a fever dream
He founded SpaceX though and that company is doing really well. Also, you don't have to be the founder of a company to be responsible for its success, like how Warren Buffett didn't found Berkshire Hathaway but still managed to transform it into of one of the biggest companies in the world
I’m honestly surprised that you guys hate Musk that much
gen z hospital was
lmao i forgot about that
Me vs finals
Finals is the one on the left
You still have to prepare for your finals though, right?
it aint too bad tho
CDC published an update on fertility rate in America and it's the lowest since 1979
cause his gf still had her finals
Exam Schedule
exam schedule
I can't imagine not knowing when your finals are right before finals start
fuck
2 exams a
You only have 2 exams?
I have 5 exams 💀
and then of the 4, one is engr 131 (which it turns out i didnt even fucking need to take) and has no final
I have finals on the 12-14th, the 16th, the 17th, the 19th, and idk when the the last one is
Last semester I had all my finals and SAGES final assignment due in the first few days and then I had like a week just to prepare for the Java final
how much money do u think it costs to bribe the teacher to get an A without doing the final
cant be more than few hundred right
ok but seriously, i wonder how much money would it take
why don't you ask them and find out?
but idk
fuck
how stupid of me
I think it's mostly poor nonacdemic education actually
Things like chronic stress, existential crises, and basic lack of hygenic motivation induce ppl to not care how bad their decisions are
And yet people are not systematically taught to manage any of those things sadly
Who cares if they fuck up their fertility
Gen Z isn't the generation responsible for low fertility rate though, it's Millennials
But agreed Millennials are even more in the shit
gen z prolly finna be even lower tho
but yeah gen z hasnt rly had much of an impact yet cause we still young
There are now more people dying in America than being born here
Those that are left of them
the issue is peoiple dont want to get pregerz
well issue is the wrong word
idk what ur on about
Fuck society
alberto has gone off the deep end
Nah I don't by it
I think it'll get so bad
Eventually it'll be worse when the entire human population was systematically oppressed
Having lost the natural faculty to do so given their ultra modern lifestyles
This is assuming that desire to have children is heritable genetically. Idk if it is since I'll admit that I don't know a lot about genetics
Nah I think yours is the short term behavior
Mine is the long term
the desire to have kids is already a genetic thing, its just the impulse is apparently too weak for a modern society
It's already been below replacement rate in highly developed nations for a long time but we're really starting to see the consequences now
wrong response sry
But at some threshold it's just says fuck it and flips entirely in a chaotic fashion
That the conscious recognition of a weak impulse to have kids in modern society will eventually end up hurting so bad
Oh no everythings dying life is so complicated everything's poopoo let's just all live simples lives and have kids now
and idk what its based on
It's gon happen
Given the priorities of our education, which don't focus on healthy mental development, and given the increasingly abrasive mountain of sensory information were given, people will just abandon the toxic modern lifestyles that cause them to poopoo decisions that lead to low fertility
it still isnt
without showing why it leads to that
Our government is fucked and will never get anything right. So the education reforms will never come
When living a simple fertile lifestyle becomes a happier lifestyle than wtever the fuck modern prioties induce on lifestyles now
Game theory says ppl will do that instead
Lol, I'm working on game theory homework right now
Bc our brains and emotions won't be able to handle our increasingly mentally toxic environment and lifestyle
Wtf do you do with your life?
ZacharyAttackery and Stochastic have stopped typing
It's for Intermediate Micro. Not too bad, it's about selecting Nash equilibria of several 3x3 payoff matrices and some questions about various games like Cournout competition
Oh there we go
Just a teensy bit tho
Self study?
There's also an entire course about Game Theory that seems interesting but sadly there are too many other courses I need to take
I which it's was an USSY class
isnt he the peer advisor?
The whole class is basically applications of partial differentiation
class*
Ugh
Mechanical math
I stay far far away from that
Don't y'all get bored
I find there's too little creativity in ODE/PDEs
Whats mechanical math?
Isnt solving DEs mostly guessing
Math w a bunch of tedious steps with no creative intuition
Well creative isn't the right word
I'm taking Discrete Math and it doesn't feel mechanical because there are often several ways to prove something so it requires some creativity
Ya i don't think discrete math or logic is mechanical feeling
The type of problems
And then it starts killing your soul a little
It looked sick
That's why if i fuck w PDEs
Apparently theres a theorem in which if a complex valued function has an oscillating discontinuity it covers the entire complex plane
Discrete Math is very useful for CS majors. The proof of why Prim's algorithm works involves disjoint sets, partitions, proof by contradiction, etc. which are all discrete math topics
I need to think about that 1
If you donnt know sets i think you can still understand Prims algo
I dont know but it was insane lmaooo
No math of that level needs to be taught anything above of intuition for 99% of grass
Proofs arent exactly discrete math are they
He started one class (he was the first maths Prof at MIT) reviewing results about something or another
Damn
And he straight up leaves the room muttering and shit
And comes back half an hour later and says
There was a famous scientist who walked into class late and saw two homework problems written on the board, took a long time to solve them and turned his solution in late, then later found out they were unsolved problems
4 math classes, a bme class, and an acct class
the math classes are gonna be fun
Oh shit I think that's him actually
For math that is
Oh
How is that even possible if her college is several hours away
i cant tell if clement is serious or not
that's a bit too hard with in person shit, but not too hard with virtual classes
Ick i hate that feeling
damn bro
i usually don't, but when i do i go fuckin god mode lmaooooooooo
sicko dicko mode is the shit
I used to fuck him from the back
I did half a xan now I'm pounding on my man
but i got some high intensity shit here
But i don't think i could use it as study music
I closed my eyes to listen
if i had a rly fast sports car i could do some mad mad speeds to this shit
Plz drive safe clement wed miss u
How do you know? Have you taken EE courses?
I haven't taken any but I've heard the same thing
My experience is that math courses are the toughest
EE is honestly applied math combined with electromagnetic theory
Every EE core course except 281 requires diff eqs
Damn
oh shit
I didnt know you cld do that even
oh
damn
Since there's other roles too...
wtf, wrong server this is CSU '24
Totally not go to museums, cuz at osu we only go to sportsball games
idk
the flats is supposed to be good
rock and roll hall of fame is downtown too i forgot abt that
no hate to them, but they unfortunately have only experienced Case during Covid
Nah, this is osu, we got car flipping cuz all the cows are dead
This is a very good point that I didn’t consider
I can't recommend this enough
Also if u pay anywhere near the full tuition, flying is nothing
Well I certainly don't pay anywhere near full tuition
u can get merit and need based
oh you can
but its been done and isnt uncommon as far as that situation is concerned
If it wasn't during COVID, my friend could get a roommate who's studying abroad during the Spring and I could take his spot
So, that might work?
def reach out to housing tho
Is there still a chance that may happen?
i dunno if they do that or not
maybe if you explain ur situation, and that u already have someone u wanna room with
but idk
Is it okay if I bring traffic from the class of 2025?
I couldn't find it
smh someone said that already
idk if it was evil, but definitely things gone wrong
see? HAL once again, evil cockroach ai ||(i thought the autopilot was called HAL  as a reference cus i remembered the name please dont kill me)||
if you havent seen the classics tho
portal is one I definitely forgot, tysm
have u watched the classics tho
if you havent, start with those
oh i forgot to add idk about the matrix trilogy but the 1st one definitely has evil ai
Wargames and tron yes, I've played portal and fallout (not much fallout tho), I haven't gotten to read the iron man comics tho
worst mistake of my life
michael's surgery robot was unironically super impressive except for the whole can kill u with 1 wrong move thing
In the event that a catastrophe comes to Earth, we will boot up @halcyon6561 and he will alone repopulate the Earth with 100 tonnes of sperm
oh
i swear I haven't gotten any notis from him
i learned russian because my mom is from kazakhstan and i have like 10+ family members in russia / kazakhstan, sorry to disappoint
aka want to play csgo and use my mic
you dont need russian to play csgo, all you need to know is rush b cyka blyat
john wick being an example of pain
i though they were italian in that
isnt all mobsters n stuff
idk if that helps 😓
I'm damn sure about that
His brain is another level man
Given that he has a PhD in math, it's not a surprise that he's a genius
ye thats the shit
I think someone has to go and update everything and nothing is automated
The math genealogy tree is actually a lot broader than just math, there's a lot of people on there that got PhDs in fields other than math that are similar
I just want to know who would date clement
i want to as well
anyone who wants to bear 10 babies
oh no
pls tell me someone took a ss of that
oh did it get autoremoved
Does anyone's sister want a 5'9, Chinese, squinty eyed male named ZHanda cHen
I feel cheated clement
oh. no
is this what math does to you
i heard that S2 isn't as good as S1
We have previous experience owning ducks and chickens, so I guess that's how he yanked the goose away from the park
good luck to anyone taking math 122 and 126 today!! also to anyone else with exams today--you're all gonna do great:chickheart:
^^ Also GL to anyone taking math 228 final today!
I need Jesus, Mohammed, and Abraham to hold hands for this one
screw finals, all my homies hate finals
@.fim. wake up bro, the final is 1 hour
oh I thought it was at 3
There are 48 hours between the 12th and 14th when I can take the linear exam
I got two of my exams rescheduled because of a time conflict so now I'm taking Discrete at 5:30 PM on the 19th instead of 8 AM 😌
5 am exams arent fun
That was harder than I expected. I actually thought I had 1 hour left when he said 2 hours remaining so I rushed some questions
smh my head
when rona is gone, we have no need for it
wrong channel bro'
damn discord won’t let me send a video of bunnies by the den
damn
Idk why those cost like $300 more than the other South Residential Village dorms
wtf
I'm fked. I got an accidental mail from my instructor from next fall. It's Irene lee. I'm low-key screwed coz 224 is hard and her reviews on rmp are brutal for Ochem 1. This is her first time for 224
I had her for 223 and freshman forgave the class and moved to 323
I can't imagine the horror of her for 324
aw it's down
her lectures aren’t much use apart from telling you what she’ll focus on for the exam
Are her exams extremely hard like everyone is saying
she has very particular things she looks for on exams
She grades each exam twice and adjusts grades accordingly, but it doesn’t really work out that well
trust me, I haven’t eithe
but this class requires that level of effort, esp when like 1/3rd of the exam problems are from the book
altho it won't be 24/7 for the whole month bc you have limited free hours per month
fair
Oh yikes, having to do all the practice problems in the book at least once makes it seem like her class is very difficult since I don't do that for any of my classes, not even close
I haven't even touched the book problems for any of my classes
I haven’t either honestly, ochem is just a bit diff in that regard I guess..
Most of the book problems are quite quick though, just meant to review a section prior to moving on
Like she sent some mail saying update and that exam 3 grades will release on Monday etc. since I'm already in her student list
Though one nice thing about her class is that you can drop any exam including the final (excluding the first exam) so a few of us have high enough grades that we don’t have to take the final
Still 🧠
just be sure to read and practice if you feel the need to though
np, I kinda exaggerated b/c the general air around the class is like absolute **fear** but with lee instead of pierson we should be alive at the end of the sem
i need to ask someone from the case health dept. about vaccines
its probably uhcs would b my guess
beware, they are a bit slow
wht do u want to know
To the Hong Konger who supports the PLA, I want to fuck you so hard
To the guy who almost ran me over with his airplane on the runway
fin help us think of ones just clean enough to slip past
it hasn't been posted yet
we cant interact
and we don't really have an upper limit I don't think on what they'll allow
i wish i came up with that one
"To the girl walking her fluffy white dog, I want you to put a collar on me ;)"
im late to this but just note that they are normally faster, covid just fucked them up from what i hear
Ope, that guy grades my Discrete Math homework
I don't think so
idk ask him
In discrete math?
idk
It's him, one of the TAs for Discrete Math is also in Data Structures since I can see his name in both courses
How many math classes did he skip
The only prereq is Calc 2 so it's a freshman/sophomore class
Cuz it's a math class I don't have to take
Any math class I don't have to take is super advanced
I don't think most engineers need it
So far I only received 1 invitation for TA application, and I got rejected
I don't know tbh. I think he's the youngest TA for Discrete since several other TAs for that class are graduate students
Damn
To be honest, I don't know how people become TAs
Idk, do whatever u like
Idk, I make 300-500 per deal, I can sell 2 in a week if I want to
Also I got myself out clean, I don't want someone to investigate me cuz of this lol
I remember us talking about the poor pay for TAs like a day ago or something and you mentioned it
But I'm still in the fucking around stage, bout to find out
What do you mean got yourself out clean?
To the guy with the big forehead and receding hairline, I want you to fuck me in the asshole tonight
ZHANDA OMG LMAOOOO
i thought it was about someone else
To the guy who always wears a polo jacket and never washes it, hit me up
I have to wake up in 5 hours
Plane
I’m leaving this dump
Oh
I can’t sleep
Chloroform actually takes minutes to work unlike in the movies
why didnt you take em smh
I still have one
well someone can just knock you out
you don't even need to criticise them
I’m friends w the 25 mods tho
I need to sleep fuck
sleep fuck?
didn't know you could do that
I've heard of sleepwalking but never sleep fucking
Damn
Honestly wish I had a roommate this semester
jnfv;kqsvjq holy shit LMAOOOOOO
i'm dead
I’ve spent too much sad time alone in my room
Ansh isn't my roommate next semester
Rip
a shame
so you won't miss out on everything
He didn't have one
oh rio
rip*
yoo it’s someone else who got upperclassmen housing as a sophmore
Did you get reassigned or were you able to apply for STJ?
blow air at you i mean
My room in the Village is better than a South Side single but still a lot smaller than a Clarke double
we don't have roommates
Yea but just by the number it's not too fair
we were supposed to be
Oh shit
I know someone with a cat and 2 sugar gliders
It's gonna feel like a huge room
Oh, so there's more vertical space in upperclassman housing then
Oh rip
I wish I could see pictures of what rooms in The Village look like but I can't find anything on the Internet
Find someone who lives there and check out their room
idk if frat housing in village is different than normal tho
sophomores can’t do external housing
I tried to get exempt
and tried to get off the meal plan too
I mean I’m just gonna live in Pittsburgh when I cant be on campus so I’ll imagine storage won’t be an issue
oh
bc if u move off campus they cut ur aid
rip
fuck
@chandachan @moseslee fuck you both
Also this doesn't necessarily mean outside of university circle, u may find somewhere even closer to campus
Fuck you
uptown apartments are expensive asf tho
Enclid 3 is alright, but doesn't justify the price
I know someone in one above plum paying 1.5k/month
he looks like he just escaped azkaban, got put back behind bars, escaped again, and got sentenced to life in prison
he also got cucked by a roomate but still
Still cheaper than village
what would be the Harry Potter universe death row equivalent
stj at sophmore rates tho 😫😫😫
I'm trying to have you fly me to class 🥵
I’m good actually no I’m fuckin dying
Tho I don't drive
Still cheaper than Uptown
but its not tho bc uptown is cheaper than my rent???
i know someone who lives in the apartments as a junior
Including electricity, water, and internet?
I checked the Uptown price before moving thov
how much is 2nd year housing per semester?
then dont live in a studio  😐😐😐😐
I get housing but the meal plans are EVIL
5.5k without meal plan
Find me a roommate, I'll move out right away
I tried
we could save so much money by living in an apartment
like it's not fair
I tried bulls hitting so hard
im moving
I went through quarantine with that since I’m so picky that I literally started vomiting through the shit they gave me
how did they get money in 6 figures
i thought most post docs were broke 😔
oh parents?
But buying a plane also saves my money so
Even though you are extravagantly wealthy
Is it near?
you still pay particular attention to money
ahh okay sorry
u know the giant hospital down the street
True, once you graduate, you can't get anywhere without a car
Even now u can't get anywhere without a car
As a college student you can walk/run across campus most of the time but that won't work after you graduate
so if i email them that i'm vegetarian due to religious reasons will they make actual vegetarian food or just hand me some tofu
dunno
I'm still waiting to get mine this Wednesday
I'm getting my second dose in 1.5 weeks
rip
oh I haven't done an image scrambled one yet
am i gonna get them all summer even tho im not on campus
I was getting them for most of the fall semester as a remote student and I think I stopped getting them early this spring semester
Nope, I just never answered them
They must have realized at some point that either I wasn't on campus or I was just never going to answer their form
I dunno if its just me, but the metal detectors in ksl make an awful racket
I think theres still some regulation in diff areas, for ex case is still doing it for now
I know some ppl from the south that are still going to wear them because the ammount of antivax ppl there means it aint quite safe
so, we dont have high hopes for their forgery skills
cant wear masks forever
need more stabbin 💉
this still exists
and sure cant wear masks forever but a lot of people on campus are vaccinated and like you said people lie
bad choice
and what exactly do you think is a bad choice o.o
cwru is a liberal stem school
i dont exactly know
except to be considered not very smart for all intents and purposes
like i hate to be a dick but masks work and people die from covid xd
and still think hes right
its sad
can lead a horse to water, cant make em drink and all that
I'm going to miss the one sliver of actual healthcare this country had when covid is over
house parties tho
guess why
@twizl_ sorry 😦
idk why but
oh
wtf
masks on dicks out apparently
anyway, I guess this means I should make an announcement for the end of school since some ppl didnt read the email
not yet, that title belongs 2 zach
you guys trying to dox me? 😐
I was wondering what ya major was, cuz i assume ur a college student right?
OH icic
is that the one on south? not yet
Rip
They want ur monies
because i got the custom food during quarantine and literally could not eat shit and had to order every day
damn
i feel rude
i need to stick out my dick at this point, its that bad :/
I will miss made to order next year, there was some good in there
i heard the tacos and pasta werent the worst
i dont look too often, but everytime i've looked for the past month and a half there hasnt been garlic bread 🥲
Yea, the hours suck
is algebra still open during covid?
Dont they have reduced hours tho?
I've never gone there
I want to be exempt from the meal plan but I don't have a religious/dietary/health reason. I have basically a 0 percent chance of getting out of it, right?
Meal plan is not so bad
Jolly Scholar seems limited with what you can get with a swipe though. I haven't heard about Pinza's, is that new?
Pinza is in Tinke and sometimes if you want something new, you can cheat and use door dash for Taco bell etc.
Case Card is very imp!!. You can't go to the bathroom also without it 😂
Yoooo I’ve heard L3 is sick
Don't accept his follow request
@lhospital6600 i don't have qanon
It may feel like work, but professors aren't benefiting from asking you to do a calculus problem; you are the one benefiting from it. The homework is to help you better learn the material. The net cost of attendance is small in comparison to the massive salary you'll be bringing in after you get hired as an engineer.
Fun fact: There are 4600 colleges in America. If you view a college education as a financial investment, CWRU ranks 47th. That means that CWRU is in the top 1 percent of colleges with regards to ROI (return on investment)
Georgetown estimates that a CWRU degree is worth a whopping $1.5 million
In addition to being top 1 percent in America from an NPV perspective, CWRU is number 1 in Ohio in 40-year NPV
What does NPV mean? Net present value. In other words, getting a CWRU diploma is as valuable as someone giving you $1.5 million right now
Disclaimer: this NPV calculation is based on the assumption that individuals are risk averse and will invest in treasury securities instead of the stock market
That actually significantly changes NPV calculations but many people are risk-averse anyway so it could be a decent approximation
You might think, "Well, it changes NPV calculations, but only the absolute NPV associated with each college but the order will stay the same since it will affect every college in the same way". I don't think so since some colleges' graduates actually tend to make their money either earlier or later depending on what type of careers they choose, which will be affected because the net present value of that later money will be discounted even further
TLDR: We should be glad about all of the homework we have to do
yes but Personally, I think that instead of removing the SAT scores for public universities, they should be creating a harder test and remove unnecessary majors to have competitive programs that will benefit society even more. Also, there shouldn’t be priority for in-state applicants because that means the smartest students may lose a seat to someone dumber than them just because they live in the state, and I think that’s really unfair. I don't think that any major other than ECE, Engineering, or maybe CS is worth people's time at a university, because those are the only degrees that will really get you a good job after college. Still many people (myself included) are rejected from programs like these because of stupid people who get in with lower SAT scores with us, and that means that we will have to settle for less-than-optimal schools, which will decrease our chances of getting into competitive jobs in the future. It pains me to think that any sane university would even compare me to someone with an SAT lower than mine when it comes to applying, especially when it comes to lower-income students or minorities who wouldn’t do well in higher education and aren’t suited for well paying jobs like me. It’s the hard truth, but if you haven’t completed 20 APs before going to college, you’re bringing the entire university down.
Aside from increasing the difficulties of SAT exams, universities should narrow down the majors that they offer to only the ones that matter, as I mentioned previously. Ethics and Psychology majors shouldn’t be taking up my spot in the university just because they want to study a useless field, when these spots could be used to expand Engineering and CS programs. It baffles me that people care about majors that won't gain them the maximum time:money ratio. ECE and Engineering majors are the smartest anyway, so there really isn't a need to have majors for people who won't bring up the university's rankings. All of the other programs that aren't as good (worse, useless, unnecessary) should be removed because they aren't as good and can only bring down the school's competitiveness, making those in the Engineering and ECE majors take the hit for other major’s incompetence. Yes, other programs might also be ranked highly, but in the end it doesn’t matter because those majors simply aren’t important, and recruiters agree with me. Overall, each university’s ranking is super important because recruiters obviously see the difference between T5 and T3 schools, even if they publically express otherwise. Lets be honest, these are the jobs that need to have the smartest people because they are the ones who do everything for all other fields who can't do it for themselves (we have to help them make things) so we're really important. Anyway, my point here is that UIUC should remove all programs except ECE, Engineering, and maybe CS.
yes, i dont give a shit about rankings
wrong answer
real talk : i dont get why people care so much about rankings
general school rankings are even worse  😳
it wont even matter four years down the line
i got a physics test in 2 hours
let alone 10x
Ive used windows moviemaker to pull that shit off before
Lol, I remember using that many years ago. I think Movie Maker is gone now though
Nope theres a windows 10 version
How do you download the lectures though?
I don't think Zoom or Echo360 have that option
when was the last time u inspect elemented
i still feel like Aside from increasing the difficulties of SAT exams, universities should narrow down the majors that they offer to only the ones that matter, as I mentioned previously. Ethics and Psychology majors shouldn’t be taking up my spot in the university just because they want to study a useless field, when these spots could be used to expand Engineering and CS programs...
I was talking to my Grandpa about the MCAT in the early 60's and they were hard in a different way. Just because they believed that in order to be a good doctor you had to know Latin and also be able to write about how you'd design a structurally sound bridge and just random shit
That seems very subjective unlike quizzing them on actually designing a bridge based on principles in civil engineering
Damn David be typing alot
My brother has damn near perfect pitch but that's a combination of a natural gifted ear and all of his music school training

Watch tropic thunder (This is the dialogue: Listen here fkface, why don't you take a step back and fk your own face). It's fkin hilarious. I've been jobless since last Thursday so I've been on movie sprees, doing research work, and chillin.
To the boy who is uncircumcised, fuck me harder next time
Oh shit do you think they’ll let us do one from the perspective of a professor?
theyd probably let u do one the other way tho
idk i feel like theyll know the professor one is a prank
Zhanda tried making a thirst post for me but it was way too tame
@quintus_fabius_ yup it just took a shit

I forgot about that
You know what all of you should do rn. Get the hulu free trial and finish all the movies within the month while getting your shit done as most of the friends are leaving by 20th anyways. Now is the time for movie/tv-show marathons
is it w/ or without ads
cuz 🏴‍☠️ has no ads
It got boring after a while so I just went for the hulu free trial rn
The ad blocker blocks all the times an ad needs to be displayed so it's without ads for me
I used to torrent but I got adware and trojan viruses. So I go clean now
Autumn really
headache and everything’s in storage :/
@ansh8867 ty but— gone
This semester my Econ class had attendance grade so I made sure to wake up early and attend all the classes. On the last day of class he said that he’ll everyone full grade on attendance. 🤡
are you at the airport dhananjay
Although you can’t control it
@nobelium19 did you complete your Harvard Medical School personal statement today?
I was at the airport but now I have arrived
It feels good to be outside campus

Nope
Guys my sister forgot her ID for her vaccine
Oops Idk the spelling
Sorry howdy
We ate delicious ice cream got full and walked away with goodbyes
for all the other vaccines i've gotten, like flu shots n shiet, i've never had to show ID so this is kinda odd
She’s 15 so school id should work lmao
Stupid SAGES
It's really retarded. I sacrificed my studying for other classes because of a fucking 10 to 12 page essay due. I'm pretty sure I lost my marks in participation
I'm sure your 95.99 in the class is crying for you
Who cuts marks in fking participation ? What an instructor as I'm not pleased at all. No, he gave a B bro. Like he doesn't even use canvas for his grading. I legit have no idea where TF I am in the class till the end
how do you expect him to get into a med school with a 96?!
Also @howdy_. where do we eat food bro? Everything is closed
it ended yesterday
I have the summer meal plan tho for portable swipes but Pinza's is closed
Plum market is closed tho
maybe they arent doing grubhub for summer?
and hoping they dont notice
They legit don't even pay attention to it
Yeah since many in the 12-15 category can’t drive lol
I'm not promoting Schwarzfahren but as long as you show the sticker they don't really pay attention
Yep, I missed an A by 0.2%🥲
Last semester he sent an email immediately after posting final grades and this time he didn’t
I have a feeling everything’s finalized
Well he hasn't posted final grades yet
Well it isn't showing up on SIS just yet
Just flash your case card. They don't even look for the sticker
I don't even have the sticker and got on twice yesterday coz it was just till Veale anyways
Context: I attended every seminar, was never late, and was one of the most talkative people in the seminar
Bro, he doesn't even give grades and I'm barely talkative. Even if we say anything, he'll instantly refute it. Damn intimidating as an instructor tbh
Who has the time to read 5 books while managing other courses also? That too it's so boring
I know but last sem I got an A with the same instructor for a different class (FSSY 185U) what it means to be human so thought I could pull the same strategy in this but since it's 200 level he's more keen on everything
That sucks man, have you emailed him about it?
He also put this in his syllabus:
> Do not ask me “What do I need to do get an A?” At CWRU, an A is a recognition of achievement rather than a reward for effort Achievement follows from effort. Even so, hard work alone cannot guarantee an A.
Isn't that intimidating
> If you fail to come to class prepared, that is, having completed the reading, you will be asked to leave and you will be marked absent from class. Coming to class unprepared is disrespectful to your classmates, to me, and to our shared intellectual enterprise.
i literally have professors that are like 'if u didnt do the reading whatever ill just go over it rq' lmfao
Asking people to leave the classroom if they didn't do the reading is horrible
He gave a whole story on how an undergrad was busy with his EC's and said he couldn't do the reading so was kicked out of the classroom. Fucking wives and mothers have shouted at him and his assistant for the grades received.
mans doesnt accept late work or provide extensions either
the professors need us more than we need them
Yikes, he seems very uncaring
i mean yea but the fact that he listed all that shit out LMAOO
I've never seen anyone drink a whole bottle of plain sparkling water
Bro tf just happened
I got 215/215 in my final math exam damn
Those who are taking Calc 3 next sem. Micheal Horst, go to his class and don't think about it
My sages class this term literally, no, literally,  was just writing the final paper, no readings, no assignments, nothing else, I even doubt he checked attendance
i had the same professor, ultra hardass about everything, assigned a ton of work
yeah he didnt talk abt grades bc he thought students had an "unhealthy obsession", which isnt necessarily wrong, but we at least deserve to have an idea of what we're getting
We didn't know our grades throughout
This is all I know about the grades: Nothing
idk
very good or very bad
is not even an english major class
ah, you're missing the part where its a 200-level class so automatically it has to be harder
lmao India doesn't need to get pummeled by students on RMP when it's already getting pummeled by COVID-19
lmao I just went to my high school job and they said I have to reapply through the website to get put into the system again so I can work this summer
...with different last names?
I didn’t even know
@sprinkles2108 I lowkey went on the slides 👀 🤫
Wasn’t someone monitoring it
bruh i feel so dishonest rn
I didn’t study them

its only us losers left
dw about it tho
I know nobody here besides the four ppl I work with

Why are Oscar nominees so slow moving 🙄
I wish you could change playback speed in Amazon prime video
You cant do that? Thats a rip
I haven't seen most of the Oscar nominees this year yet
It's kinda stretched tho imo
So gripping and wasn't bored at all
Really, agaIn?
That's 4 minutes away
But twice consecutively. Wtf is happening
So during class, there's shit on South Side but during summer, North Side is dangerous
i be far away from all these emergencies 🤠
Not too far though
then whose far away then :P
im like a mile and a half away from the quad
I think you had a discussion with someone else on here about the pricing of apartments
never, cuz who would do a case alert for cc
i mean safe ride reaches where i live so i feel like youd still get notifs from anythhing near me
Bro, if tomorrow there's another emergency imma die
and it only takes 1 shot to kill someone
It's 4 minutes away from the campus. How is their no risk?
How can they say "all clear" so quickly when it's 5 minutes away from North Side?
cuz
doesnt pose a threat to us
I guess they dont have a list of people who are here
and people who aint
usually all clear i feel like when it doesnt involve students
Guess what. Rn, there is a bag of flaming hot cheetos taped to my door. I guess this is how CWRU pays me for staying over for summer ;). Odd timing tho after two emergencies
@megmcmuffin22 if i die will you bring me back to life?
Oh
What happened to it before tho?
Some of the keys broke
Also pls refrain from doing @ everyone lol, it doesn't work anyways
Butterfly is the worst. The new model removed butterfly so the keys are so much better
I mean I don’t think they’re that bad
But they’re bad
No they're that bad
guess i'm not wanted :aPES_Cry:
bye
far too much simpin, not nearly enough ice cream

Idk too many CWRU 2025 students that are that savvy other than Gabe
bc i studied #remote this year
idk is it?
never been to ohio before
@raunakwastaken I hope we didn't get off on the wrong foot earlier. I was joking along with you
Maybe a mod can set it up since I can't do much 😦
I reached out to Annie though, so I'm just waiting for a response
That's not a bad idea tbh, but it might be easier to just have everything in one place
I'm worried we might lose traffic that way
people are inherently lazy and hate zoom
omg miss girl you better come to nyc/nj 💅
Omg
im waiting to hear back from mine
my dad got me one but i gotta pass the nepotism test 💀
So far either ghosted or rejected
there has to be so many things near osu right
I hope you get your research/internship though!!
Haven’t heard back yet
I have a lab at cwru but I gotta work with my grad student to see when I can start
i miss you and running into you in taplin
Shit :))
Cuz most people’s classes die out

anyone got the blueprint diagram for upcomning Fribley commons? Can't find it anywhere online
Fuck man. I just did a huge mistake. 800 dollars of bookstore bucks got wasted as I did not use it only and it went back to university. Every semester, it renews. I could have just bought an Ipad pro like my friends had bought electronics like airpods pro. I'm so stupid. 800 dollars fucking vanished now
I asked the bookstore owner and she said the money doesn't accumulate for next semester and it's not offered in the summer also. I just wanted to see the price of my Ochem book (A used copy was 255 dollars)
Do you know anyone else this has happened to?
Oh so it's complementary and you don't have to pay extra money in addition to your tuition for bookstore bucks?
That's why I'm pissed
Maybe I'll get you an iPad if I have money left over lol
All the south side people gonna miss that 😉
Isn't the stuff at the CWRU bookstore overpriced though?
Kinda but towards beginning of fall, there will be sale and you want to spend your bookstore bucks
don't the bookstore bucks get charged to your account
So you didn't miss out on 800 dollars of free stuff
Oh I thought it was
Guess it's just a ripoff then
Plus the bookstore owner was explaining about the bucks in a very misleading way so I guess she was capitalizing on my lack of knowledge at that moment or I just misinterpreted it not knowing how bookstore bucks work
They want a profit after all
ive never been to the bookstore 😎
it charges money to your account
boring
Are you back home already?
idk what that means
oh
~~gn tho~~
it's been a while since i've taken spanish lol
Nothing 😶
huh what do u want?
no
last time i did was in elementary school
oh god it's been a while since i typed in arabic
I'm sorry 😦
Don't trigger me bc I don't have any left 😦
oh
Oh same
Isn't that fk
That's 10 degrees cooler than last week
Btw 115 is the “feels like” temp cause humidity goes brr
I probably can't watch a movie tonight, but if I am ever free one of these days, don't hesitate to reach out with an invitation!
bye!
sorry was tempted to use it
work quality also sharply declines, but quantity > quality
even before the drug test
Can’t fail a drug test
that'd be horrible
can't go to med school
Momma told me never to fail a test. So I gotta pass that drug test
y' = kx, where x is the amount of crack taken, y is the rate of study productivity, and k is the crack parameter (e.g., varies between meth, cocaine, heroin)
zhanda, it's actually a system smh. You forgot that q' = -kx+C where q is quality of work.
When we are together and studying on crack, the situation can be modelled by the following system
y' = 2x+100y
x' = x+100y
Here, y' is zach's measured productivity and x' is zhanda's productivity. x and y represent the amount of meth consumed by zhanda and zach, respectively
The constant is 2 for the first equation in order to take into account the possibility of Zhanda's consumption of cocaine during the study session
Zach, find the explicit solution to this system 💀
but, we get no work done 😠
study rate tends to infinity!!!!
what if you die
however, you didn't factor in the upper limit
I love how physics problems always say air resistance and energy loss can be ignored
oh shit
Does anyone want to go to Cleveland Museum of Natural History. I have a ticket at 11 am tom
So is Detroit worse than Cleveland?
I'm working on static analysis of JavaScript programs
That means being able to analyze code without actually running it
and wade isnt a dorm, so you cant exactly make ur "room" there
idt soph dorms have ac either
Ugh
I haven't visited a museum in 1.5 years :cursed_flushed:
Sometimes, you get a headache if you're alone. It feels like you're stuck in a never ending maze
My house was very eery when my parents were gone for 2 weeks this semester
Being alone is not fun
I do not recommend living alone lol
I had some independence in that I could leave my house to get food whenever I wanted to
I missed my parents though ngl
Forgot to tell you Priyanka
Still better than any South Side place or Clarke though in terms of people:bathroom ratio
It won’t be like freshman dorms
Jose is the only one who doesn't object to smoking
He's still a non-smoker though
I have two friends but can't do anything about it
He even taped his security alarm and covered it so he can smoke in his room
He's leaving to UMich tho so 🤨
Isn't that a big fire risk?
Everyone here is mocking me but apparently the biggest cause of home fire deaths in America is smoking materials https://www.nps.gov/articles/p52-cigarette-butts.htm
I think it's Staley tho
didn't Sashvat say he's not in tippit
contains cigarette butts so they don't catch shit on fire
I know the floor arrangement but forgot which building
Everyone left 😦
everybody left
the logo still looks like a bed
ur not wrong
why is it easier to stay awake when i don't have studying to do
that's not fair
I never take naps, I only like to have one sleep session everyday at night
My experience is that I can feel weird after a nap or I'll accidentally nap for 3+ hours
Afternoon naps make me feel worse afterwards
I mean same but I still nap😂
How much sleep did you get?
Uhh idk
3 more hours is 21 hours a week though which removes a lot of time from your schedule
3 more hours just means less discord imao
Me in elementary school but I took those days for granted
True, when you still have the do the same amount of work in a lot less time, you'll just work harder during the remaining time, so it's not actually that bad
Not just for your brain, I've heard that so many aspects of health are affected by sleep
The only 8 am I had was my sages class but that wasn’t in my control
I guess I'm okay with morning if they're after 9 a.m.
I forgot Case has required pe
I heard there’s a swimming pe
I used to be an avid swimmer, but since COVID, I haven't set foot in any body of water lol
I wish I didn’t quit the sport in general. I swam for cross-training but probably should’ve stuck to it
I was never good at butterfly though
There are some universities that require everyone to be able to swim, but Case isn't one of them
what about people who can't use their legs
I thought it was weird when I heard colleges require a swimming test
I’m sure they don’t need to learn it then
Swimming is so relaxing ugh
It seems that there is no pool at Wyant though
The chlorine is bad for your hair so rip
I haven’t swam in a reallyyyyy long time 😳
How is it raining rn?
Cleveland weather is unpredictable man
You fail the class
Wrong picture
So not only do I drown but also fail the class?
You just need to take 2 pe classes
I’ll prolly take yoga or some shit
I didn't take any PE classes so far
i tried to take yoga but it filled immediately 💔
Yoga is good and all until it’s culturally appropriated and then you don’t feel like doing it anymore
i used an app for a bit :xCrittyx: now i gotta pay money
omg
She tried to get me to become a yoga instructor actually
I thought to myself I’ve never taken a yoga class how can I train to be an instructor
Workout apps never helped me🥲
I have really low stamina do I
Not me powering through my headache by looking for jeans online
i wish i could do that for studying
I miss cinema popcorn
i miss the slush
My wardrobe needs an update so:vibe:
I forgot y’all don’t have intervals
Not American ones though
i'm sleepy
I don’t think I ever find you sleeping
i sleep when i feel like it
wbu
IST doesnt exist, only EST
I’m actually very sleep now. But sister kept me awake
You’re wrong
React with like emoji if you think est is the worst
Did it happen yet?
There are so few PE classes that you don't really get that much of a choice though
But my body says I’ve slept enough
I got a decent amount of sleep, but I'm drained from starting at my computer all day 😦
Nope
It helps, but it gives me a headache if I wear it for too long unfortunately
I'm trying to read print books whenever I can since I like those more
Online classes at CWRU were never closer than 15 minutes apart since the schedules were originally designed to give you time to get across campus
I had a day last semester with 6 classes though
I was talking about my school, but I only have two days left, so I don't have to deal with classes that are only 5 minutes apart anymore
I would still take a break for 5 minutes though because I have trouble paying attention to lectures too long without a break
Yah, I never appreciated in-person schooling until I went remote
The average grades in my classes this semester were higher than usual apparently
He said it might be due to people cheating though
An alternative hypothesis that he proposed that I think seems realistic is that people spent more time studying since there was less other stuff to do
But I might be wrong
To save on money, you need to read online pdf's. The blue light glasses kinda help tho but then when you go to the outside world, you feel like a vampire would
That's the worst. There's so much glare plus the eyelashes could also come on the lenses obstructing some vision. Best vision is in the dark
I have bushy eyebrows and thick eye lashes so it's worse for me in terms of vision in sunlight but it improves with photo chromatic as I don't feel like perpetually sneezing then
My dad took a photo once to show me and my eyelashes hit the center of the lens
I tried to nap it was not successful
I guess my glasses aren't as close to my face then
Mine aren’t either I just rest them a little farther down
I have a microfiber cloth that I use to clean my glasses everyday
I don’t know where mine went
So I use my shirt which is bad
I use that and a cleaning gel. That same friend gave the gel and it's magic
Contacts make my eyes die
Can't get enough O2 even with drops
I lose track of time only
I've tried everything this week only from door dash. Taco bell, paradise Biryani, Cheesecake factory, Subway, Panda express, some other Chinese place for birthday treat also. I'm satisfied 😁
i either starve or get euclid or doordash
Damn
I haven't really gone out east but explored Cleveland downtown: flats and aquarium with friends. Rock and roll hall of Fame with dad. I was in east for a bit with my dad in the beginning.
I need to go there
After that, I didn't explore much for quite some time till finals were over
I haven’t had Cheesecake Factory in 3 years oop
I havent been in like a decade, but I just remmeber their food being bland
The color of this sunset with the rain is :chefkiss:
I can't see much from my dorm at least. I can only see a shade of orange far away
I was just walking back from work and saw it
Wtf time did you come in
nevermind video wont send nicely
I don't think those are firecrackers
I can't send a video as it's too large of a file
I thought so. It's end of senior week
cwru zoom or something idk
I put an insta post rn where it was mad towards the end
ah sick
There it is. That's the mad fireworks display
oh damn
I forgot fire works are legal to use
there was a lunar eclipse early this morning
I wanted to wake up at 7 this morning but I actually woke up at 9
Well lately there’s been a lot of cloud cover cause of the cyclone so I anyway wouldn’t have been about to see it
I feel asleep waiting for it to occur
big sad
I didn’t even know about it 😦
there is also a total solar eclipse that's going through Cleveland in like 2024, so that's gonna be even more sick
Oh I was asleep then
Man can special sky stuff happen when I’m awake
JEEZ it’s raining so hard
There was lightning outside my house for a solid hour 😦
it won't be like that within the next few months
*rain in summer*
i left my car windows down when i got to the gym, and it started raining shortly before i finished my workout
it was just a sliver so it didnt get soaked that badly lmao
I think he's moving into Clarke Tower for summer housing today
southside dorms don't have carpet i thought?
Is it because it doesn't have air conditioning?
Oh more than that
I have the large single in Clarke tho
Let's see. Now, I'm scared 😳
It was cheaper than the other housing options so just went for large Clarke single instead of a normal one
Don't know why it's hell
Village for summer is $38.50 for summer and Clarke large single is a double room with no roommates basically but still better than Hitchcock being $14 cheaper than Village
I don't think there's anything like that
the carpet everywhere is killing me
That's the room. I hate it that there's a bed above the study table. I can bang my head easily being tall
simply duck 5head
Yh, I did that in Hitchcock also. It feels like you're on some dangerous mission moving away from the study table
if you really wanted
Pray for me 🙏. I hope I don't break anything
This is not the standard physics problem of two blocks on top of another moving in the same direction. This is two huge ass boxes with different weight components and innumerous amount of friction forces acting on it and the trolley and me trying to balance it. This is real life my friends!!!
never make 2 trips
just don't push it hard, problem solved
air resistance is given as ju
what if he keeps his rats in his boxes?
That's a win guys. Couldn't have done it without your help
I'm still upset abt missing out on the Alban Berg opera from last season
Literally one of my favorite, and never gets performed
i'm still upset about missing them all except for one
rip
pls don't remind me what have i lost :sadcat:
is the bathroom on the third floor still clogged?
Can my headache go away oml
I even ate well today
I’ll just go get more water I guess
Have you tried a pain reliever?
So I won't be surprised
What did people do if the toilet on their floor didn't work? That doesn't seem sustainable for more than a day
Took Tylenol twice yesterday
I use acetaminophen or ibuprofen when I have a headache
I don't like drugs entering my body. Painkillers make me sleepy
How dumb do you have to be to consume something that tastes awful lol
Alcohol tastes awful?
it tastes terrible
I've never tried sex on the beach. It's supposed to taste amazing
It’s the worst thing I’ve ever tasted I think
communion wine hits hard... as in it tastes terrible
Some shots could be tasty. I've just heard
but by and large, if you ain't making cocktails or mixtures, it don't taste great
It tastes terrible tho. I'm innocent and drink simple lemonade and fruit punch.
I'm avoiding consuming alcohol because it has some bad effects on health
Store-bought juice is also really bad for your health
Do you know if there's enough water in The Village?
I can't enter the village man. Idk anyone from there
Can't you get water from the faucet in the kitchen?
Yep headache is the most common withdrawal symptom of coffee even though I drink it every few days
hmm why are you trying to get off it?
So probably never this summer
oh ic
Well I just stopped for a few days and boom headaches
I shouldn’t develop an addiction
I still need to wake up at 7 AM everyday so I'm drinking coffee since I always feel so sleepy that early even if I got 7-8 hours of sleep
Oh in high school I started school at 7:20 every morning but never drank coffee
Thankfully I never had difficult classes at 7:20
Consequently I’d be next to dead by 1 pm and that’s when I had my harder classes
Fortunately, I don't have difficult classes until Algorithms at 10:35 AM next semester
Oh goshhhhhhhhhhhhh
oh lmaooo
IM DEAD
just realizing that all my math classes for the past 5 years have been morning classes
lol apparently multiple math classes at the same time thats great
the one im taking this summer's in the morning as well, so have every one ive taken here
All of my math classes at CWRU have been morning classes
tho if i took scicomp this spring it would've been an afternoon class
No graded homework for Calc 2, I had WebAssign for Calc 3
i took diff eqs last fall and we only had graded group hw
You can do practice another and it's damn chill
AP’d out of math 122😎 *except I took 126 so🤡*
I didn’t learn anything new
But I forgot it all
So for med school you have to take a college math class even if you did Calc BC in high school?
It was one of those classes where I didn’t need to pay attention
That’s it for math
I don't think there's any calc on MCAT
For example, I skipped pscl 101 so I took a higher level psych class
someone ik from clemson told me the 3 most failed/dropped classes were calc 1, calc 2, and statics
The pre-med advisor says they want you to know that you're able to do more complicated courses
It really depends on the person and school
avg on the exams was a low C
PSCL 282 also counts as a stats class so if you take pscl 282 you can’t take stat 201
I'm glad I don't have to take Statics, it sounds horrible
i went to the prof's office hrs a few times, and he told me it's mostly juniors and seniors in EE/CS who take it, and he was quite surprised i'm taking it as a freshman
lol I tried to take Stat 333 w/ wobjor, but I dropped it bc there was a lot of prereq knowledge that wasn't in the course description
No, I went to her office hours and talked to her sometimes. I am interested in taking Numerical Analysis but I would prioritize Scientific Computing first
what shit were u not hip to?
it be like that for sports cars, doing 100 on the highway is just trivial shit
314-316 aren't actual classes I think, only 312 and 313
Which class?
MATH 380
Y’all didn’t apply to UC schools?
Nope
Nope
Even worse for internationals
That's really bad
And the 3 digits at the back of the credit card
oh. don’t reply to my text then beck
fake julia fan julia doesn’t have a dog
Raunak, you need more work in this scammer biz
Clearly I have disappointed howdy
Sigh
my ssn is ||u just lost the game||
Also I just got a text on my phone with some code? Who here needs it?
aw
Bad
Never again
oh shit is he someone's parent 💀
can't you read your own message
I want a new control bar for my kite

Is he there, or is he trying to give me the slip?
(Give me the slip)
You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown up now
Baby, can't you see?
Julia's dad has got it goin' on
He's all I want

Julia, do you remember when I mowed your lawn?
(Mowed your lawn)
Your dad came out with just a towel on
(Towel on)
I could tell he liked me from the way he stared
(The way he stared)
And the way he said
"You missed a spot over there"
(A spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your mom walked out
Your dad could use a guy like me
Julia's dad has got it goin' on

I'm in love with Julia's dad
they go hard
that hurt like a buttcheek on a stick
Some thing about the dark web n shit
Can’t be believe they let SSNs get leaked
It's really bad, leaking names, phone numbers, or addresses is already quite bad, but leaking SSNs is about the worst it can get
They don't have our SSN
Only grades, family income, and shit
So shouldn't be so bad
Don't know about credit card stuff tho
They’re students leave them alone
A lot of hackers don't care about the victims of these leaks, they just want to make money
A few months ago I believe
But they're saying that the hack is worse than they originally thought since it actually applies to all applicants
Is it weird I no longer receive a notification when getting the everyone
I've been on several servers where it wasn't disabled and everyone did get notified :cursed_flushed:  but they changed it afterwards
class seems kinda dope
I would do both, send a request on SIS with a short message and then send a longer email explaining why you want to take the class. I don't know what their criteria is though
I'm not experienced with this type of class though, since permission is needed for different reasons than for my classes. In my classes, the reason I have to ask for permission is because most CS and math classes are very overstuffed and I have to get permission to register for a Closed Class
I'm assuming the reason that this class has a "Consent Required" tag is because it's new and 400-level but I can't claim to know the true reason
yeee, it says open to undergraduates so i assume it's not too big of a deal and they'll most likely grant it, only other issue is that orgo 1 has [4] meetings on random fridays which cut into 20 minutes of class, and its the only orgo lecture
and it's raining where I am rn...
It’s like windy here tho
50 is so cold lmao
yeayeaok bye
i miss the chill
RAIN IN SUMMER IS WEIRD
I got AC now tho, its not strong, but its something
*nah it's turned off*
Spring rain>>>>
Summer rain is just.... too much
summer rain is nice
rain in general is great
Spring rain brings about a drop in temperature while summer rain is typically accompanied by humidity
Don't die this summer
Unfortunately since I’m only half Jewish it doesn’t worn
My blood isn’t pure enough
ok gn cant open eyes :xCrittyx:
He’s not CS major tho
Wrong
dunno, 17.58
It may feel like work, but professors aren't benefiting from asking you to do a calculus problem; you are the one benefiting from it. The homework is to help you better learn the material. The net cost of attendance is small in comparison to the massive salary you'll be bringing in after you get hired as an engineer.
Fun fact: There are 4600 colleges in America. If you view a college education as a financial investment, CWRU ranks 47th. That means that CWRU is in the top 1 percent of colleges with regards to ROI (return on investment)
Georgetown estimates that a CWRU degree is worth a whopping $1.5 million
In addition to being top 1 percent in America from an NPV perspective, CWRU is number 1 in Ohio in 40-year NPV
What does NPV mean? Net present value. In other words, getting a CWRU diploma is as valuable as someone giving you $1.5 million right now
Disclaimer: this NPV calculation is based on the assumption that individuals are risk averse and will invest in treasury securities instead of the stock market
That actually significantly changes NPV calculations but many people are risk-averse anyway so it could be a decent approximation
You might think, "Well, it changes NPV calculations, but only the absolute NPV associated with each college but the order will stay the same since it will affect every college in the same way". I don't think so since some colleges' graduates actually tend to make their money either earlier or later depending on what type of careers they choose, which will be affected because the net present value of that later money will be discounted even further
TLDR: We should be glad about all of the homework we have to do
Adam has this shit saved
Every time someone mentions robot this pasta must be used
In addition to studying, getting a good sleep (7-8 hours for me), eating well, and caffeine intake are crucial to good exam performance in my opinion. The marginal utility of several extra hours of studying are not worth the lost hours of sleep
I always take caffeine pills before exams
I can't get everything I want done. Compromise is needed and I decide that sleep is important to me. Sometimes I only go to 2-3 clubs in a particular week if I'm busy and I frequently skip reading the books for classes where I feel good enough about my knowledge

damn yall are mean
which monday
that shit almost gave me a fuckin heart attack
so it looks like by the end of the summer you can reproduce?
This was taken verbatim from one of David's messages
I've heard of it, but idk what it's applications are
Java Virtual Machine language that is similar to Java but has a lot of functional programming features. I need to learn the basics of it since I need to do some work in Scala
but it still takes a lot of time to get comfortable with a language
Guys i found clement's source code:

```If (Message.says("Highest heart rate I've ever recorded was 175 BPM after an extremely intense exercise")):

     Print("my heart rate went to 200 once after i beat the hardest level in a game\nthat shit almost gave me a fuckin heart attack")```
also i don't mean to rain on your parade, but if you try to run that python script, it will encounter an error bc you capitalized print
or doing methed math
smh you can't forget that
huh ive never tried capitalizing the p
fuck you
sorry, you're not my type
damn adam is sassy today
reverse engineer my shit to find out
I went to sleep at 10:30 PM last night but now I'm awake at 1 AM lol
RIP
She doesn’t sleep
I couldn’t fall asleep until 2 am 😦
went back to sleep
Can anyone care to explain to me what the server icon is supposed to represent
A fat man with a surfboard
A fat man with a surfboard on a bed
i need to bleach my brain
Fat boi summer ofc
nth much just bored :xCrittyx:
oh really? I haven't seen it. Is it good?
Wasn't it too much of a mind fk that nobody including the cast understood it?
i've heard about tenet but haven't watched it yet
Why is Case still fucking around with international students  guidelines for vaccines
i mean they are still fucking around with guidelines for domestic students too
I might have to come a whole ass month early to the US
hm yeah that makes shit harder doesn't it
While my parents don’t have to
oh fuck that sounds hard
is this just cause of ticket prices?
I just wish... they mandated the damn thing
daddy cowen's emails have been ambiguous tho
I currently have the Indian vaccine available. But it’s still in the process of getting WHO approved
oh, you took it?
I haven’t cause I don’t wanna take 2 vaccines lol
throw away your indian vaccine card
The government doesn’t want you to know this
oh fuck @chandachan it is still stuck on racist mode
I can feel someone coming at Adam for using black skin emojis
I already got Pfizer like a 2 months ago but they were giving free walk in J&J shots at the cleveland airport when I was going home so I got another one 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Why? You're not supposed to take both
I'm gonna go back and get the sinovac
Like after 2 initial shots u need to get another one?
In how many months
there's not much difference between prior infection and no prior infection for 2 shots
Tetanus is really bad, so it's a good idea to get the booster shots
It's especially important for ppl working construction and landscaping
Scary thing is that there are 40k people a year around the world that die from it
In 1990, 300k people a year died from tetanus
holy fuck
how many ppl get an infection every year?
Anti-vaxxers + people who don’t have insurance
I could be wrong though
Good question. There seems to be a lot of different numbers on this and some websites even list more deaths than cases which shouldn't be possible. Our World in Data says 90k, there's an article in The Lancet that says 200k, and I found an encyclopedia that says 300k. There are all for around 2014-2015
Almost nobody in the USA still gets tetanus, these deaths are almost all from Africa or Asia
It should be noted that vaccines aren’t 100% effective
Probably because those countries have more laborious work
Orrrrrrr they don’t have as much access to tdaps like we do
It's because poor countries don't have money to spend on public health
I’m sure you need insurance to get those vaccines
I’ve not gotten any yet
Most people get a tetanus vaccine as children at least but I don't know about the boosters
It's sad to think of how many lives have been lost in the past because people didn't have access to the vaccines we have now
Yepppp which is why studying public health and working in that field could be a good thing
I hope there’s serious change in the coming decades
My arm hurt for a few hours but I felt fine otherwise
All my friends have already gotten info about next sem from their colleges. Idk what case is doing
I had really bad chills
They’re ✨slow✨
Jkjk case ily please don’t kick me out actually please let me in to your med school
In AP psych I learned that the flu shot is only 40% effective
holy fuck fr?
Yeah that’s why many die from it every year
Don't researchers have to make a new flu vaccine every year or something like that?
I don’t know
Is it cuz influenza evolves extremely quickly?
They can't require you to get a vaccine if it's not possible for you to get a vaccine, right?
lotta countries in europe pulled that shit while it was hot cuz it fucked up so many ppl
I know someone in Bangalore who’s grandma got Covid (asymptomatic) even tho she was fully vaccinated
that shit will def cause WW3 in ur body with the other shots LMAO @raunakwastaken
i think the inactivated virus may still have similar side effects as the mRNA ones, cuz some recent research showed that the spike protein's the culprit for covid
yup, salk institute did a study on a pseudovirus with the spike protein and it cause a lotta the same symptoms as live virus
So why don't most of the people getting Pfizer or Moderna vaccines have COVID-19 symptoms then?
The spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor not like y’all don’t need to know that or anything
Most people's side effects last for a lot shorter and aren't as severe as COVID-19
I wish I read more on it though
cuz of RNase
so there needs to be a vector of transmitting the genetic material
now, for one strand of mRNA, can it only go thru one ribosome or can it go thru multiple and create multiple copies of the protein?
No idea tbh, I don't even know where to learn about most of this stuff
Because we never talked about it being used more than once
i do know that the ribosome translates the mRNA into the polypeptide chain by pairing off rRNA codons starting with methionine and ending with a stop codon
would there be RNase at the end of the ribosome to chew up the mRNA?
We never learned about RNase I don’t think
ik about DNase and RNase cuz in the lab we got deionized water
Or maybe we did I can’t remember
which makes it suitable for storing nucleic acid chains without them getting chewed up
I don’t recall those terms from my bio textbook from last semester
ye i dont think we learned about those in ap bio
but we did learn how enzymes work
don't histone proteins do that by modulating which genes are introns and exons?
I’d pull out my bio notes but they are super detailed and I can’t ctrl F on actual paper
sick
exons get transcribed into mRNA while introns don't, so that's the on/off switch. what other important regulation mechanims are in place?
I don’t know the actual names of the mechanisms but there’s one where the DNA is transcribed into mRNA and the mRNA is stored until it needs to be translated into polypeptides (if the cell demands it)
Is that due to cell specialization?
oh shit operons are a throwback
Everything's in one cell for prokaryotes but everything needs to be done by a lotta different cells for eukaryotes
I think with this convo I’ve confirmed I don’t wanna be tested on this
Ahaha I was tested on this ✨last semester✨
I hope I don’t have to go through this topic again
But then it bugs me that I don’t remember 
But then I don’t have to
But then why did our school teach us 4 years of bio
bioinformatics and biostatistics is some real shit
Rip them then
Aight I’m sleepy back to sleep gn
~~dw it’s even worse in Palestine
Infact gene regulation was explained by Bader in terms of a car accelerating
Nothing else
Without CAP protein
Ah crap I forgot
SHIT
powerhouse kinda shit in the mitochondria LMFAO
Oh ew 215 topics ew ew
what made 215 a pain in the ass?
This is what non CS people must feel like when we talk about data structures
i'm sorta an "omnivore" when it comes to learning cuz i like a variety of shit, since that helps with big picture thinking
i just focus on EE and math cuz that's like heavy lifting, so training those seriously will give me the most mental strength and fundamental understanding
sick
I know I need to know Krebs for the mcat but idk about photosynthesis
I took AP bio sophomore year
Senior year I took anatomy
what made 215 a pain?
Oh I just found the content boring and it was so much memorization
oh damn
note that the shit that u watch on tv is called "programming"
215 isn’t terrible I just didn’t try hard enough because I was mentally drained by the middle of the semester
i took a semiconductors class this spring which was hard af, and i scraped one by 0.02% LOL
The last question has 2 sentences that were highlighted from the website so he cut the marks for the whole assignment only
oh
Damn, that's absurdly close
Bro you can’t do that at all
cuz u reminded me of @dayruin's ENGR 200 class
So it was even harder for me. Simbio was just 10 marks and in the finals, I got 7 mcq's wrong still
the final was pretty fucking hard that's why
But lost two marks on FRQ
@ansh8867 You copied someone else for your answer? Is that what happened? There's some confusion here
WTF that's scuffed af
Oh
So he said it's not your own work. In comments: Accept 0 or academic integrity
Well makes sense, none of your work should be copied from anywhere
gotta paraphrase shit
that way u don't get copyright striked
ansh bout to get called from every office 💀
I accepted the 0. This was long time back tho. Maybe module 8 - gene regulation one only .
i did shit on the first semiconductors exam
Omg me in bio 214
I did bad on the first exam and then improved
Wish I did that in 215🥲
I did better in the finals and second exam where the average was 10% below mine.
A low C? Yikes, especially for such an exam heavy class
ahh rip
I don't know why engineering classes are so difficult
Drew Meyer doesn’t run the class😂
cuz its fundamental shit
Me neither. Engineering is actually cool. I would’ve pursued bme if it wasn’t so hard
I assume that there was a final curve at the end of the semester?
My pinky fell asleep
idk if there was or not
but when mid sem grades were due only the first exam was in
80% of our final grade were exam scores
Final curve for ENGR 145 was damn lenient
Which semiconductor class
I don't need to take that right
friend of mine who took it with me told me this was also harder than anything else she took
Nope
theres also a MATH 321 (analysis 1) that's notoriously tough, but i have it with a good prof this fall
now u should know why one of my catchphrases is methed out math
high lvl math fr is like EE classes on meth
someone else ik took 321 and told me it was damn near impossible to get an A with his prof
i just think its kinda funny how for EEs and math majors, 321 is the notoriously difficult class
that's sick, i hope to learn a lot from her
wow she isn't taking a leave at all
I expected her to leave on sabbatical considering that she has a newborn
no, i'm taking discrete so i can get better at math
how is the class so far
yeah it covers like basic math notation and proof techniques
ah then idk um unsleep?
awake
be awake
i want a cat
for anyone wondering
@kaori_flute what type of cat do you want?
i want an ugly cat
sth that will not torture me as hard
What are you working on
omg i should
@_frostyyyyy_ What's happening in the math club?
Math
Math
We don't have summer meetings as far as I know
College clubs do not typically meet in the summer, at least in the pre-COVID-19 era, since most people wouldn't be on the campus
When dreams are worse than reality :wobble:
If my dreams were real, I'd be dead 7 times in high school ( I think I got the dream from playing a lot of campaign modes as I used to die often)
When summer break started, then  I had dreams about taking an exam or waking up late to an urgent email etc./ my PI emailing me etc
Taking my bio final where all MCQ's discussed about differentiating one movie from another and another about crystal structures. Then, I send an email to Sir as I realized I already took the exam and woke up
Were you not able to test your code on that day?
I doesn't have to be related to what you're doing but the emotions of that event could represent that in real life day events
There was a SAGES on Science of sleep and dreams last sem but juniors took the seats and there were no seats left so I had no option but Bharat
I even sent closed request
I really want to take the Biology of Sleep and Dreams one
But it filled up when Class of 2023 registered
Some people sleep only 4 hours
I manage to get 7 to 8 hours
I would feel dead if I consistently got 4 hours
There are some people who only need 4-6 hours of sleep but they are rare
This data is kinda old but I didn't find something newer yet. CDC article says that only 8 percent of adults sleep less than 6 hours https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/sleep04-06/sleep04-06.htm
Nice. I'm sad I have some zoom meeting at 9 am tom
now I just fucking die after doing any basic task
Never mind, I can sleep peacfully today
Today, I'm celebrating by watching Zach Snyder Cut and then will deactivate my hulu and hbo max add on free trials and get back to work
i just die
I’ve spent the last few days reading manhuwas
That sounds like every remote student tho
Oh shit how is this not the 25 server
birds are not real tho
Alright guys I need advice. my lab’s grad student suggested we meet after 5/24 since she needed time to catch up on her work in the lab after her trip. I followed up with her last Tuesday asking when she would like to meet. She opened my email a few times but didn’t respond. Do I send another email?
I would send an email. It's been 5-6 days which is a long time without a response. I don't like that kind of uncertainty.
That’s what I was thinking. Tomorrow is the last day of May and I still have no idea what I’m doing this summer
Bro the only research I’m doing rn is how to get someone to respond to my email🥲
Fair
I've had times when people took weeks to respond to my emails
I didn’t respond because I accepted this lab already
He didn’t have any open positions for the summer, but was willing to discuss stuff for the fall and beyond
Really?
I need to help write methods in one language to analyze another language and I never coded anything in either language before
That’s why I didn’t move forward with any of the bme professors I connected with this past fall
I didn’t have the time to learn new languages
They wanted you to program?
I think if I looked back in my emails I can find out
Isn’t 1 yo “1 year-old”
that shit fr gives me wings
She should reply with: 💯 sorry fam all g
is she replies with this i'll die
*💯 sorry fam ~~all g~~ i actually don’t want you in my lab anymore
to cut the cake ofc
Yeah imma drive 2 hours to demand a response to my 3-sentence email😤😤😤
How can you track if someone opened your email or not?
But it wouldn't hurt to send a follow-up btw
oh crap
Prob unis didn't even read my recommendations
It changed my life and I spent the last year at home
For Gmail you need an extension
Idk if case has their own tracking system
really?
they track stuff like the daily and shit
I don’t know if they can track canvas exho360 vids though
That's specifically for one class though and for each professor, not the entire university
My last sages prof didn't know how to share screen through zoom
Understandable tho he said he never used something like that
Pain
Only downside to the extension is I can’t track on my phone
Pain
It’s 1:37 am and I’m forcing myself to stay awake to talk about tracking emails in a college discord server
What a wild end to the weekend omg
But I don’t wannaaaaaaa
This is the most normal thing tho
yo databases track is shit
Last night I went to bed at 130 reading articles
there is this one class that has a pre req "graduate standing" like bro wtf am i suppose to do
i don;t wanna be basic 🙄
if you don;t go to bed i will castrate you
Nothing compared to what I'd do if you don't go to sleep lmao
i need to kinda fix my sleep schedule
Stay awake 20 hours straight, then whatever time you go to bed you will feel sleepy everyday at that time
bad night
Once when I was little I got into an argument with my parents I said “bad night” to them before I went to bed
has anyone here taken ENGR 210?
@raunakwastaken Are you on the Computer Engineering track?
@halcyon6561 has taken 210
sorry it's a major 🤡
that depends on who u are and what ur natural aptitudes are, but have u taken phys 2 yet?
phys2 can be taken together with 210
that's what i did last fall
i unfortunately can't take any more classes next sem
which class seems sketch?
im not sure about that yet. but i'll drop either linear or dept seminar(ENGR/ENGL 398)
ah that won't be as theoretical as 307, which is what david and i took this spring
307 is a good class for those who rly want a challenge
how did you find that
MATH 307
Oh
we did them on sheets of paper, then turned them in during class
No thanks I want the easiest and most practical math classes
Miss me with that pure math shit
i'm wondering if i should invest in an ipad for all the written hw
but mosssseeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss, fancy math can be useful
submitting pictures of shit online is much more convenient
oh no the pain
oh ptf prolly not
For shit like English tho?
Why can’t I just type that shit up
oh hell nah what evil professor would want hand written essays?
Fair
I like to do pen and paper and then scan it using my phone
I could see the benefits of an iPad though
I assume that we'll go back to handing in assignments in-person though
That'll tilt the scale back in favor of pen and paper
cuz of mental exertion
@_frostyyyyy_ for solving math problems and taking notes, handwriting is ideal, but for reports and essays, typing is ideal
@raunakwastaken when shit was in person, canvas assignments will say "Submitting: on paper"
Then as a neuro major you’re in luck because math 125 and 126 are not hard (if you’ve got strong math skills)
But yeah 3 math classes in total
You can also just do the handwritten homework on your iPad and print out your completed work if need be
And if you don’t take a lot of notes
Technically MATH 126 isn't calc 2 since it covers a bit of calc 3(Largrange multipliers, planes, partial derivatives), a bit of linear algebra(matrices, determinants, Gauss-Jordan elimination) and a bit of probability(discrete and continuous along with binomial distribution)
I take my notes on an iPad as well since it’s pretty easy to keep everything organized and I don’t lose anything
However, I use the Notes app instead of GoodNotes, which I’ve heard many people use
You download the slides to the app you take notes on (for me it’s GoodNotes) and annotate away
Most of my professors this last semester use Notability
That I don’t know but I wouldn’t be surprised if you could. You could export your notes as pdf files to google drive or whatever and print that way too
I just saw till season 3
I think they fit a bit of all kinds of math in 126 since for most ppl who take 126, 126 is their last math class
isn't discrete math like more imp than any other math class for us
Linear Algebra is very commonly used in many branches of STEM
A lot of AI stuff needs Calc 3 and Linear Algebra
Y’all I just did the math diagnostic
Linear algebra professor kept emphasizing how important the class is for data science, scientific computing, etc.
no no i talked to someone who had a data science minor and it's not that bad actually
The very last topic we covered in Linear Algebra is Least-Squares which relates to statistics
Something like that I totally forgot how to do those
the money is just :chefkiss:
data science is what happened when stats and CS had a one night stand
U taking the test this fall?
Do it imma start studying for it tomorrow
haven't started studying for it tho
We can study together
Fuck iolab
we still have to take the lab component tho
There won't be anymore ioLAB now that it will be in-person
That sucks
I dont think the class itself is bad, its just the labs that suck
I meant that there will be in-person laboratories and you won't have to use the IOLAB ever again
In person labs don't need iolabs???
nope
Laboratories will be open again, you get to use real instruments instead of a bad iolab
Albeit the labs in person are worse than iOLab
Cause you gotta stay 4 hrs
What do you do in 4 hours
you don't need to stay there for 4 hours
If you dont 💀
I heard they're very long
it's a 1 credit class
4 hours in a lab but just 1 credit damn
How is that part of electricity tho?
oh i thought that you took it this sem
Nope
Next sem, I don't have any SAGES. First sem without SAGES so should be exciting
omg that is so expensive
Yeahhh I'm not sure if its the right amt tho
I didn't even use it
This is true. We covered other stuff that wasn’t in AP Calc BC which is equivalent to 122
Like things don’t carry over
Okay, so if I still haven't used that $30 at the end of the semester, then I'll print as much stuff as I can until I use all of it
Or don’t waste paper for no reason...
Use it as much as you *need* to
fuck them trees
You don’t want lines?
Nope
Oh
nah i want the pic where he is sitting and the sun is hitting his face
I don't know if he did, but I did
My work starts on Wednesday itself. The meeting was 30 minutes long but the guy is first year PHD
Yh, and I miss one whole Ochem Lecture
I only spent like 5 hours total on research training
Lucky bro. For one freaking month, I was doing training only. Before finals, I managed to complete everything except one last section, which has 4 online modules to complete in it. Now, this final in-person thing
I had 10 modules each of which took 30 minutes
but engineering textbooks don't fuck around
The government requires any student researchers getting money from certain agencies to do these modules
I didn’t even have to send a follow up email and my grad student responded
She even told me what I’m gonna assist her with yeet
No I’ve never done any histological work but once we finish up the behavior part of her thesis we’re gonna analyze tissues
BRB, close to there
I’m at the school of medicine
Damn, that's good
And get to do some meaningful work
Because like I wanna do a lot of lab work
So it’s not hard to get into research your first year
It's hard I would say
You need a lot of patience
I would’ve been working in a lab last semester if Covid wasn’t a thing🤡
If I do get a research opportunity as a freshman, will I be able to do any meaningful research?
Short?
One of my friends said they did a research opportunity and ended up cleaning glassware 😦
My research lab has only one grad student who has 5-8 people helping her so idk if that’s small or not
Nahhh I haven’t heard much of that here. You’ll get to do work lol
There is a hierarchy when it comes to research. Many grad students, PHD/med students are pretty busy in their work so you need to continually email them if they don't respond. I just like associating myself with industrial research plus it helps later on.
As long as you have the will, there's a way. Also, talk to your navigator to update your resume etc. That really helped
It currently sucks lol
I haven't updated my resume in months lol
Aniruddha's work ethic is insane. Two minutes after the meeting ended, he set the meeting for next time as well as the recording of today's meeting. WOW
Or someone else. I'm scared I might oversleep and miss the time to go to BRB
What if someone sends you a Discord message at 4 AM? Will that wake you up?
There's only one way to find out
Go to sleep very early tonight
I barely hear my Alexa alarm. It's only my phone alarm
david, you need to moderate your grinding
David you should sue them since you trademarked "Rise and Grind™️" and they didn't give cred
@addat Have you found Julian Assange yet?
@kaori_flute did you happen to find a vaccination to the tomato virus ?
Uh it’s been June for only 41 minutes idk what planet y’all are on
negative 2 hours, 16 minutes
yeah idk about that
Clement probably wants at least 10 children
Never about China tho
You want to raise kids once you have settled down?
Zhanda you need to have a lot of children to save China
I don't think the effects of population decline will be as radical as it is in Japan or Korea
There is still a sizeable agricultural community in China, especially among the ethnic minorities  (e.g., Tibetans, Miao)
Rural families are accounted for in the fertility rate but it's still well below replacement rate
Fertility rate in China last year was 1.3
I don't think it's possible for China's TFR to drop below 1
No, there are almost 6 million Tibetans in China and their populations haven't shown any indications of decline
@raunakwastaken @chandachan fuck the ccp, imma build my own lineage and turn it into a galactic empire
probably not, cuz i'm honestly going for quality over quantity
if i have a whole harem and make many babies, they'll hardly know me cuz it'll be much harder to get to know them
even having 2 at a time creates problems
In the school of medicine building itself
Speaking of child policies y’all gotta remember that China was hella poor back then
wait is there anyone here who doesn't want kids
I mean China is able to handle having way too many mouths to feed now
this emote makes want juice
Could find work in the US/HK/somewhere before doing a Masters?
kinda depends on what opportunities I stumble upon and how I’m feeling
Not sure what I can do with a Bachelor’s tho
A lot of people on this server don't like children
who doesn't like smol kiddlets?
actually they're annoying as hell sometimes so nvm
Are kids annoying or do people suck at parenting?
also some ppl can't have kids
You are not a bad investment
Sometimes I tell my parents I didn’t choose to be here when they try to get me to do chores😃
i didn;t mean to make fun of that
damn look at ms sassy pants
I mean to be honest we’re all here without our consent
Once my dad said “we choose our parents”
My family doesn’t practise Buddhism but a lot of people here adopt certain tenets of their philosophy
“Pervasive” specifically because I’m not antagonising Christianity but I would have to argue that it’s much more more “in your face”
Climate change bad so no
that's a fair argument
i still don't know if *I* want kids
Climate change is bad but that's not a reason to not have children. This article makes a good argument for why you should not let climate change discourage you from having children: TLDR: the assumption that having more children will lead to catastrophic increases in carbon emissions is based on assumptions about future carbon emissions that are completely wrong https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/13/21132013/climate-change-children-kids-anti-natalism
Even if climate change makes the world's ecosystems worse, the advances in technology will still make the lives of the next generations better in my opinion. People live longer than ever and the percentage of people living in poverty is lower than ever
have you considered how fast our population is increasing? we're probably going to exhaust our resources at faster rates, and if we don't innovate, then we'll increase carbon emissions and just make things worse
tldr: either humanity gets its crap together or we just end up living in misery in a few decades
this is true tho, one phenomenon is that developed countries are not increaseing their demand for technological and resource-demanding products as fast as developing countries, in these countries they are having less children but other countries like Nigeria are going to explode in population which could excaserbate migration for example
I still think we should have fewer children and increase adoption, on the other hand another thing I support but that is quite controversial is giving birth control to developing countries, people outside of these countries tend to say immediately "eugenics omggg !!!" but some of the women living in these places said report that they would like to take control of their reproduction, which women in the west have had for long " preservatives, sex ed..."
population can still grow by a lot in developing countries
might not be necessarily war but famine, and even if nothing bad happens their demand would still impact hardly the earth
There is nothing "natural" about deaths from preventable disease. Is it natural that people in Africa still die from malaria since they don't have the finances to afford the same kind of healthcare and technology that we do?
War and disease are terrible and there is no silver lining to them
The debate should hinge not on the definition of the word "natural", but rather about the fact that many people think that disease and war are necessary or that humanity should die because temperatures went up, which I find to be very pessimistic viewpoints
I don't think so, we are veeery far from skynet
I never said that disease and war should be enforced as preventative checks in nations without a prominent healthcare infrastructure, but if you extrapolate data from the past, it is very likely that they still have the upper-hand in poorer nations
computer vision can detect a horse, but if you put a small black square in the center of the horse it could still break  most predictions
That's narrow artificial intelligence. AGI means an AI that can do anything a human can do except better by orders of magnitude
like in central africa or india, tbh India is already decreasing the rate of increase in population tho
You are right, the threat of overpopulation is not so imminent at the present, but it still looms over our shoulders
we are still far from any ai that can do something significant
at the end of any report that says ai can destroy humanity they say something in the words " we are still far from it"
Oh
I read somewhere this is supposed to be the missing link to a state controlled economy, the soviet union failed in part because of the logistic difficulty of organizing a bunch of information and resources, which computers can do better now
didn't know about that huh
Wtf based
It's also not difficult to imagine Western liberal-democratic governments exploiting new AI technology in various ways that infringe on citizens' rights. If you observe countries in which democratic backsliding has already occurred, such as Poland, the Philippines, and even the UK, the repressive potential of AI has already been somewhat embraced
@_frostyyyyy_ Do you want to the prying eyes of a government agency to enter your parents' bedroom at night?
I'm always late to every class so no idea
"So professor, how many questions on the homework can we do after today?"
i didn't catch that message 💀
"Hola miss, you looking nice today"
ENGR 145? Was he really?
"So does anyone want to answer this question, feel free to raise your hand in Zoom" - SI
honestly i never got why no one says anything tho
not even me trying to speak all time
Sorry 🙇‍♂️
i don't remember name but you were like "omg when are we having bonds chemistry???" :so_hot:
she wasn't my TA but I was trying to see what was going on
ignacio he was good explainig but he got me mad with his grading
me trying to be concise and do hw quiclky and he be like " where di you get this value from" minus 1
why long how many pages u used
it was a bit too much and I felt sorry because he is also a student
man i wish i had this level of enjoyment in life
not necesarily tho
Never
that's prob Chri's office
i've never smoked before ?
The plans have been finalized: Room 110E, Tippit, 20 ounces of weed
Rober also hasn't smoked. That's what I think atleast @quintus_fabius_
that's tru tho
cigarretes are bad kids
I will lock the door and never come out of the room
it seems it's too residential
u'd need to pay
@quintus_fabius_  I can give you a tour or so. I haven't gone to any game or such but the Stadiums are near downtown
This would be true in theory, however in practice I think most of these advances would only benefit the shrinking middle class and the upper class that can afford them. While I have no doubt that at least *some* advances will benefit the working class and impoverished, the vast majority of advances will not, and the ones that do will likely not outweigh the impact that the destruction of our ecosystems has on their general quality of life. In addition, while it is true that poverty is at an all time low, extrapolating that out to the 2040s and beyond ignores the fact that the wealth gap between the top 1% and the working class is higher than it has ever been, and in Western nations, much of the middle class has slipped into the working class; thus, with the current direction Western nations are heading, it is possible that we will see a decrease in median income over the coming decades. We also have to factor in the massive refugee crisis that we are, at this point, virtually guaranteed to have, even within the United States, and the associated consequences, including skyrocketing population density.

It also assumes that these technological advances will be made and become affordable in a timely manner or at all. My biggest concern with climate change is that humanity may poorly adapt to the new conditions, wishing to continue life as we once did, or adapt in an unequal and inequitable manner at the very least (the latter is far more likely, if our current path continues). Advancement and affordability are not inevitable.
If you want to meet a lot of people, go to Dave's. Might get a headache and suffer from nosie pollution but yh
I don't get how this is confusing? At cwru we have tippit, taft, taplin, tink, tinkham-veale, veale, cutter, clarke, cutler, dave's, and dave's
theres so many people and they were mostly upperclassmen at the point i started to go
Some people in Hitchcock could hear moaning noises in the night while taking their exam
This goes for any nation: climate "commitments" mean nothing without action. Regardless of the nation, I'll believe it when I see it.
Guys where's the student employment office
@inexorablesalmon Bringing the philosphy of Ochem to class
damn
anyone get their financial aid award for this year yet
No. I was told that I would get my financial aid by late July
LATE JULY
nothing but pain
For the award, all I got was a "coming weeks" vague statement
i don’t remember when we got them last year but i didn’t think it was that late
I'm expecting to get it this month though, I doubt that I still won't have it in July
Yeah one of my scholarship associations have been wondering why they haven't received my financial letter yet :thonk:
wow y'all really don't wanna talk
Wtf is going on in Ochem. How did we manage to cover 2 chapters of 80 pages in one day of class starting. This is some insane speed
2 chapters is nothing bro. Next week is 3 chapters :SniffSneezeTears:
Then labs start tomorrow where Lab reports are due every two days
imagine taking a class
1 month isn't enough time to absorb the thousands of facts from biology. Organic chem must be another level of pain
For 214, I barely managed to read all 14 chapters but doing 216 as summer class would be lot of content I guess
Well it's 5 weeks, it's rigorous but I think it's doable, Idk about OChem tho
Nvm I guess it's not 5 weeks 😢
Exams are 75% weightage
HW and 2 exams. 1 exam on 17th itself (Ch 1 to 6) and then finals
7 onwards but all Chapters are cumulative so it doesn't make a diff
Imagine having finals
Couldn't be me 😎
Today's going to be a semi late night for me, as I have to study for my quiz in bio 🙃
Oh wow. Gl. I have two home works due this week but it's graded on completion only so not too bad
Also, STEM classes during the summer? Pain. Y’all are troopers fr
wrong server nobel
Bruh I'm still studying smh
I'm taking a couple minutes of break because I'm tired of looking at my notes for 2 hours
So feeling better
even tho she isn't
I did consider applying but the responsibilities didn’t really appeal to me
Imagine being productive during summer. Couldn’t be me
I literally have stuff to do but I don’t wanna
I was looking at the Daily and this woman (I forgot her name) graduated from Case medical school at 23 and I'm like 🤡
She got a bachelor's before even graduating from high school
oh
I think she completed her college during hs
My imposter syndrome went 📈📈
I can’t even do college in college and she did it in hs
There's this girl who was in my ARC rodent training that day. She's a rising sophomore and has 60 credits from HS till diff eqs
Tbh I guess if I tried really hard it *might've* been possible to get a bachelor's in high school
If you want to graduate early Case aint it, I suggest to go through some dual enrollment program with a public university
I know someone from Florida who’s got their bachelors degree already from FAU I think. Maybe they went to the same hs
Bruh that's the same college she went to
He told me that 14 year-olds get into BS/MD programs from that school or somethin
Oh, that makes me feel slightly better
Same but my IQ is nothing compared to hers
I was mixing glow stick liquids at the age of 4 saying I wanted to be a scientist of some sort ‼️‼️
I’d cut them open and place them in water
But her passion was already so developed at 5 itself. That time, it was more of what do you want to be when you grow up types
Yeah fair
i had no idea what i wanted to do but then i was like "hmm i kinda like this cs stuff"
For a while I wanted to pursue law because many told me I’d make a good lawyer
and my hs cs teacher was like "most people change their majors from cs to something else" and i was shit scared
ME TOO OMG except I was closer to C-level
Lol my parents were disappointed, but they kinda gave up, and that's when I got more A's lol
Oh my dad did the opposite. He basically transformed me into a new person. There’s a saying in Hindi that translates from “they went from donkey to horse” (donkey being dumb and horse being sharp)
My mom on the other hand, gave up on me a long time ago
Apparently we're supposed to be popular
My dad believes in me though and I’m like ahaha🥲
bc ik what my catholic school teachers would have said
i thought we could all be in the same bible study group 😔
i think i turned that guy down
Don't reply (Best answer)
one of my high school friends keeps trying to sign me up for cutco
oh fax
@nobelium19 would you be interested in bible study group for this summer?
that guy was a legend though, they gave him full reign to go around the audience and hit on people's moms during one segment
idk how i feel about that
he had a section where he would walk out into the audience and do whatever he wanted
oh no this was at my high school
Nah don’t worry I was the socially awkward loser so it was lame for me
what happened :0
I think most people miss college more than hs
college>>
can't miss college if you didnt go to one 😎
i want sth in the middle
hs was pretty fun I thought, but I didn't really know how to interact with people yet
idk how I was so popular
missing school? :thonk:
I don’t even know
I disliked 98% of my graduating class
OH MOOOD
zoom college wan't it
I'm 90% done with studying, but I can't motivate myself to finish it, so I'm going to sleep, gn and c y'all tomorrow
I suck at mcat oml
bro Nobel you work almost as hard as one of my HS friends that is juggling a job for a congress peep and a double major
Might take a whole exam just for funsies
Hs was very stressful for me though
Imagine taking a 9-hour exam for fun...
Nah what I meant was I wanna see how stupid I am
Fuck off :)
That kinda suits me tho
I don't need this sass
Some (me) are too dumb and lost to be neurotic
I’m actually so lost on what to do as a pre med oops!
they never had one doen there
I haven't been in years
I’ve never skiid
i never skied after i got scared of heights for some reason
okay i never skied here
that sounds like work
but zip lining sounds sick
well, you can only do it once if things go wrong zach
i never understood what cross country is. do yall just reach canada or something?
I mean if I die then it iz what it iz
my mom has skydived but i was way to scared to do it myself
cuz
that is stupid
Hence why I never liked it
damn relatable, but also heights scary
Yeah I don’t like running
I’m just pushing you out the plane
You won’t be able to
Oh fack its 1:36 am
that is very bad
rip
esp if ppl want to come back in the fall
@zacharious did you upload your card?
ofc i did a few weeks ago
smh i don;t have nitro
You don’t need nitro the emote’s here
naenae doesn't like me 😔
Yeah it doesn’t
kinda sleepy
I’m awake at 1:47 a.m.
If that’s not a bad sleep schedule, I don’t know what is
Wtf based AI
i watched a video yesterday about why socrates didn;t like democracy
Imagine still smoking ancient Greek philosophy
RT and TeleSur are considered to be very biased sources of information though since they're funded by the Russian and Venezuelan governments
It's interesting that Grimes says that the communists she knows don't like AI. I read a book called Homo Deus that had this quote:

> If Marx came back to life today, he would probably urge his few remaining disciples to devote less time to reading Das Kapital and more time to studying the Internet and the human genome.
My bad
Anyway: ai can harm democracy, democracy can weak and lead to poor decisions, one cannot stick to one or two media sources form one side
Why not just read media that doesn't have a clear side?
I think there has never been a democracy
I refuse to elaborate, and I leave
Ok I can read them but that doesn't change the fact that we need to read news from many outlets, saying rt is biased undermines a lot of good journalism they do on topics the west doesn't consider important
wtf 🤣
Given how they operate, most western media don't pick a side until it is to their interest to do so. They're doing a pretty good job now that u can't tell which one of those they r doing
I agree, one can't just say this media outlet is 100 percent neutral
RT almost speaks like a western media now, very strong opinion, play with words. Russians have really stepped up their game since the cold war
Doesn't even know how to do propaganda
Ofc, again tho I said I dont care so much about their opinions, I care that they do journalism on aspects that the west deems not so important
Things like problems in Colombia haven't been covered as much
For example: the situation in Palestine and Israel need to be studied from both sides
One big issue in Colombia is the treaty of free trade with the us, many of its points need to be revised, now where do you see that mentioned anywhere in the news even though people have made it clear during protests?
The articles that I've read about Colombia make it seem like people are protesting since the President is proposing tax increases on poor and middle class people and the government is using excessive force, never heard anything about free trade
are you saying western media don't manipulate information?
That thing you mentioned was removed almost a week ago, but people still protest
And Reuters bit again Reuters seem narrow on some topics
Yea they selectively find sources to back their narrative, but
Tho it could be a very biased one that fits their interests
That's why one needs to make the critical difference between fact and opinion, again, I watch rt as much as say other conventional media because of the facts they show, for the opinion I dont care as much
I feel like I can get away from making up a lot of stuff
One small nugget to finish, western media hasn't had the same pov about protests in venezuela as the ones in Colombia, even though they ARE very similar, here there's been elections stolen, censorship, people dissapering, hundreds of local social leaders killed and so on, yet, the US and int community blockades and treats as the worst the got of venezuela but about here in Colombia, western media says "oh shoot people are mad cause they don't want taxes, I guess that's ok" when in fact colombian and venezuelan govts are not as different
Same situation with Chile in 2019 and years before, but guess what the govt in Chile was backed by the west cause they tried to invade their economy with international Corp, now that the protests after years of represion, dissapeared people and so on managed to achieve a new constitution the western media says "Chile celebrates New constitution" and they blame just whoever was in the govt at the moment or rn when in fact the problem in there has existed for years with support of foreign corporations
It can't be that simple right
It can't be
Maaany Venezuelans don't support Guido either they know he is a puppet
Anyone want a link to a discord server for one of the dumbest scams I’ve ever seen?
Basically it’s a website where you buy and sell land for real money in a game that doesn’t exist
well except it's not open source and the developers of the game get a cut on every transaction
and the entire value is banking on this stupid impossible game being made
replied to the wrong msg
Scary how willing people are to give real money for virtual items
Anyone want free nitro, I just need a credit card number
I was going to try to find a witty response to that but I can't find one, sorry
I will adopt you when your parents leave you on the roadside
I don't know how you did it but you somehow reassured and threatened me at the same time
Nope I'm out
Absolutely I have some left over
RIP raunak got rejected
I didn’t get a DM
Oh yeah today was my 400 day streak so there's that
@_frostyyyyy_you saw what happened to my streak right 💀
I heard that you lost your streak
I need some friendly motivation
I lost like a 100 day streak but I'm slowly rebuilding
You are too, don't give up just because you lost your streak
I ordered biryani and saw two movies: Fruit and Nut and Joe B Car also so I can work my ass off today
I still have to start on the micro CT analysis still lol
It's annoying when you miss one structure.
However, I'm getting faster now. The thing is I only had one day to learn resonance and line angle formula etc., which I never did before in high school so that's why I was stressed
agreed tho :xCrittyx:
nah it sucks
To this day, I still don’t understand why De Beers is considered a monopoly
According to Wikipedia, they controlled 80 percent of the diamond industry for a long time, but it seems like they've lost most of their market share in the last several decades
So it doesn’t technically qualify as a monopoly anymore, right?
Not anymore
The modern diamond industry wouldn't exist without them though
friend is getting job at cle clinic and wants recommendations for where to live
They're all expensive, but still cheaper than university housing
Tho I don't drive
i think that made sense, just came back from yelling at a linux terminal for two hours so my brain doesnt work
Why do you need to use Linux?
Raspberry pi automation shit
Yeah, its just s bit hard because what I want to automate requires running in a web browser and I havent figured out a good way to make it so it does not
they are good, except when you need them to still run when your tab is closed 😢
either that or im dumb, they call me a fake cs major for a reason
don't know what you're trying to do, but sounds fun
also idk I've only used flask to run a dynamic web page. I should really look more into it's capabilities
Yeah, the solution seems to be some weird combination of bash commands. Its basically for a monitoring system that also records data when the user isnt in chrome
Oh fuck
Did the air conditioners consent to it?
do air conditioners exist? why assess something that does not exist?
Idk but I saw this in the source code:

``print ("I consent")``
sorry the markdown commands suck on mobile
I didn't know those things could even drift
it fucks the wheels tho
Altho I think I broke a gearbox doing that once
I'll put a mask over the camera to fuck with your computer vision
Help I’m stuck with a 7 year-old at a party
This girl really tried to get me to do a backflip
David would never do that to me
The real robot here is this kid she keeps on ramblinggggg
damn, roasting kids?

@djsurti , don't tell me you did Newmann Projections, conformations, and bicyclic alkanes in HS?
idk neuro tho :0
What is that place? I've never seen that dome lookin thing
Hmm, I've probably walked along that road but didn't see that structure thing.
Please pray that I didn’t screw up tonight’s dinner !
I don’t think I did? But who knows
If anyone is bored and wants to help me with a jigsaw puzzle, here is the link: https://jigsawpuzzles.io/g/03d34422-615b-42a3-bbb8-692e558991aa
Oh I do mess up frequently, but I try to fix my mistakes before it’s too late
Thankfully my meal turned out good today phew
i can't come :wearycritty: which why i said "send"
Oh shoot I can’t read
Y’all if there are 2 things I have no shame in flexing they’re my cooking skills and my taste in fashion
A variety of meals, but mostly Indian right now since that’s what my parents are used to. But if it were up to me I like to make food from other cultures
Cooking honestly isn’t too hard as long as you follow the recipe
I don’t have charcoal
But I want one
My mom wants one
Ovens can't even reach the right temperature
Yeah those who don’t own grills
Grills though make the outside so much better
one condition tho
Can I show up uninvited too, I just need to use the grill
Bro just use a broiler you don’t need a grill
Didn’t need it
Wrong
Oh shit I have a broiler grill not a charcoal one
I dont have this exact one but its close enough
My mom wants to get a charcoal grill
Sorry daddy’s😔
Don’t know how to feel about getting lighter fluid on something I consume
Is that supposed to equate to lame?
Howdy you too don’t lurk
I'm still wondering if I flambe it will i trigger the smoke alarm
Only way to find out is to test it
Well almond extract is like 90 percent alc and people used it all the time last year for baking so you don’t have to be of age
I don't do "culinary alcohol"
I’ve never used alcohol in cooking
Priyanka have you ever tried cooking in the dorms?
Also cooking in dorms would be hard
But I can make it work methinks
Oh lit
Then don’t judge the cooking conditions in freshman dorms lol. Only one of the burners work if ur lucky, the sink has not been emptied since the building opened, and the refrigerator is a public health hazard
Also, I will wipe down everything in my dorm room before I unpack. I trust no one’s cleaning
Yeah fair
and i feel like its hard to judge your suitemates if you havent met most of them irl but good luck with maintaining a tight ship
Fair fair, but if I recall correctly we all said we’re clean
I don’t think I’ll have an issue
well you're not howdy and i aint a snitch
OMG LUCKY
Don't, they're announcing new MacBook Pros on Monday
I got a discount as a rising freshman in high school. All I did was tell them I was a student and planned on using my laptop in college
just wanted to know how the discount thing works and if there;s a limit
If I walked into Apple today and told them I’m a college student, I’m walking out with a discount on a product I buy
If they want proof, then I wouldn’t mind showing them
Bruh idk if you can buy multiple iPhones while saying you’re a college student
“I need an iPhone for each of my classes”
I guess the US can afford to have an honors system then idk LMAO
shit
oh boiy
“I need an iPhone for each of my classes though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡”
They had this sick promotion in Dubai where if you buy a Mac or an iPad you could get AirPods for free
its called back to school offer
We have a sick promotion and it’s called Black Friday
Black Friday is sick
Not the lines though
*buys a new iphone each time the power runs out*
that'll be too late
How does that work
I need a new laptop, so I might grab it tbh
I should buy a new laptop but with so much maintenance that my house needs rn I’m gonna die of guilt asking my parents to shell out $2k for a new laptop
damn do it. Make that 💰
They probably won’t say no, but stilll
Big sad
Sorry but we live in an *advanced* society
My MacBook pro is about to turn 10 years old and I have had to fix it about 4 times
My MacBook Air is incredibly slow
samsung girl thicc tho
hopefully she doesn't break up any time soon
Nope nope nope
Android > iPhone and iPad os
I hate maintenance issues
I have a Samsung phone and still waiting for her to wake me up 😤 😤
Hold up what? I didn't know samsung girl was a thing
I'm going to buy a new phone later this year though so I might buy another Samsung phone but unfortunately their prices are kinda ridiculous now
What do you mean your house, our gen don't buy houses
well it is still cheaper in the us so...
they really are
You parents don't ask you to help with bills after 18?
apples would be pricey even though they're low tier fruit
So I have all the money I could ever want
So you don’t lose your new Mac
i will buy that and place it on me so people can find me when i get lost this fall
Is that like an overpriced “Find my iPhone” gadget?
I don't use Snapchat. Never found any reason to use it
Duolingo keeps telling me that I can learn a language in 15 minutes a day but 15 minutes of social media doesn't do anything for me
I don't know to be honest
I never post anything
actually how has been fixing your mac book? The parts must be hard to find
Last month, it used to be upto 6-7 hours for me. 4 movies in one day
Not much since it's a MacBook pro and 2012
Yeah I don’t got the strength for that
The newer ones are fucking soldered into one piece
So you can’t upgrade storage for shit
I will never use 123movies and I don’t have Amazon prime
oscar movies are usually bad
@djsurti u remember we talked about farmers not able to fix their tractors
*well I don’t*
i dont remember that
smh my head
Idk about this year's nominees but a lot of the ones from last year were really good
It’s discounted for college students, but not free. I don’t have a consistent income to afford it
For 6 months
Too much work, also I never buy anything from Amazon since it’s not a habit
I only resort to Amazon if I can’t find something at a local store
i will be really disappointed if that is taken
That's why Amazon stock skyrocketed in the last year
it aint
closed@case.edu
There are many dicks tho
and she "didnt know if "poggers" and another one she mentioned was the right person
Yes we have 2 emails. You didn’t know that?
Did you claim the third one yet
it's noon for me tho
I didnt see 😢
You missed your chance
It's 1:16 AM here and I need to wake up at 7 AM :cursed_flushed:
I don’t know why I’m wide away rn
kids, don't do caffeine right before bed
I did OChem. I've never had caffeine since last sem.
That was a bad joke ngl
My brain is sick of coffee I had some after a week and I got a slight headache. Idk if it’s because of that but who knows
OMG YAS I did a science fair project on this one year
When I drink coffee I dont fall asleep but it shortens my attention span, last time I took coffee before an exam I would spent time looking at flies midexam
i took coffee for intro to java final cause it was from 2-5 am for me
didn't help at all
oh super early morning exams hit different
I couldn't sleep that day at all
Take the exam in Java
I drank coffee with an espresso shot the night before my bio 214 e3, stayed up til 4 am studying, and powered through the day and exam somehow
I took caffeine pills for the Intro to Java final and then everyone here made it seem like that's weird
@_frostyyyyy_ you shouldn;t take caffeine pills
I usually drink coffee instead but there's sometimes when I don't want to dirty my teeth
I never got a cavity and I only brush once a day
It never ignited tho 😢 😢 😢
Lowkey i just wanted to make alcoholic beverages
I must have bad teeth genes since I have to brush and water floss 2-3 times a day and use a fluoride rinse 2 times a day
Nah I wanted the fuel but now I know how to make cheap jungle juice
i thought you don;t do that?
I can't imagine not flossing, there's so much food stuck between my teeth if I don't floss
If your saliva is more viscous (thicker), your teeth are at greater risk for cavities because they don’t clean your teeth as well
You did not have one sip also. I can't believe  that
nope never
U don't even feel the alcohol you just feel like the hot chocolate is super fresh
I’m sorry but if you actually find joy in consuming alcohol then you have awful taste in food
Ofc, I just still want to have it from time to time
It gets cold in the trip :Angryhaha:
it would be cold chocolate by then
Maybe, but I doubt it. I don’t like any alcohol
Alone  🤪
You won't get cirrhosis for one sip bro
Lol, it's not too bad once in a while
I don’t drink soda
It’s so carbonated I can’t handle it
ITT: People who've never tried alcohol preaching about it
Have you not ever tried a meal just to try it?
I've also almost entirely cut soda out of my diet. I still drink one maybe 6-12 times a year but for practical purposes that's insignificant
It's completely understandable dont get me wrong
if you think alcohol is the big bad evil, but continue to drink coffee, then i dont know what to say besides, its just a fit of fearmongering
rip
I'm just saying at one point you see that life is all about risk, you only need to be alive to die, whatever you do there is a risk and a possible fun in doing it, you just learn how to balance
still a drug
some people say alcohol is bad but are addicted to coffee
Caffeine intake would be worse than gatorade
That is literally so bad for the environment
For example, I hate having to sleep too little, thats is harmful long term, and yet many people do it while studying, so I tell myself to not be too double sided and just make a big effort not to sleep too little even when I'm in the middle of the semester
Or having energy drinks knowing that many of them can cause hearth problems
Just to do an exam
makes sense tho
I agree tho with wasting stuff, plastic is a marvel of the modern world, such a strong material and gets thrown away after single use? I try to keep bottles for as long as possible as my water bottle
There are micro plastics is SO many of our products it’s scary
#catholic school lessons
unfortunately
couldnt be me
Couldn’t be me
couldn't be me
Couldn't be me
How am I still awake omg
I’m wide awake
why i wasted an hour and 20 mins on discord is beyond me
sigh
I was falling hard
It wasn't a waste
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
I spent a long time preaching how alcohol is bad in a college discord server who was I kidding
If you don't have anything to do, then find something to do
sigh i don't seem to be finding the motivation to do tht
i am currently working on making an instagram clone tho lol 👀
rather die
Also I have work starting next week
I don't watch anime
I didn't see it but I heard about it
well the sat dont matter before the fall of senior year, and after the summer u graduate hs
so u cant blame the mans
props on him tho to manage to make money off the collegeboard
I on the other hand am horrible at it
anyone have justice league snyder cut downloaded?
Nvm I ended up buying it
Doesn’t 123movies give you a virus or something
See the whole Snyder cut but Friends reunion wasn't there so I did a one week trial in Hulu and combined it with HBO Max using both services simultaneously.
couldn;t be me
fat rip
Tbf everyone hates her
"we will never have a woman president because we tried one and she fucking sucked"
I think this country could benefit from a woman President as long as she’s not Kamala Harris
and then she turns around and does shit like that
@moseslee we need to increase the asian population in america
she pronounces her own name wrong 😒
oh damn i didn;t know that
This country needs mandatory pronunciation education because it’s about basic respect smhhhhhh
There’s no need for a political debate on this: mtj is awful
we need to save ourselves from jewish space lasers
Oh sorry that was a typo
isn't it ironic that the woman who started that is suddenly the one who SUPPORTS ISRAEL
Politicians are openly hypocritical and have no shame and that’s why I hate ‘em
he;s gone now
<3
Lesson 1: don’t say conflict or imma bonk
Lol love how everyone tried to look woke about what’s going on in Israel and Palestine (both sides) and suddenly it’s died down
why don;t we have a bonk emote?
eye—
server needs boost
We don’t use like half of them lol
someone boost the server
Life is getting real with every passing day and I don’t wanna do this
I have some worse ones lmao
what did i miss
You don’t need to delete all 50
we have -44 slots left 😭
Oh wut
It’s not really for me
hardly anyone in my whole school watched anime :wobble:
I personally don’t have anything against anime fans though
@kaori_flute raunak hates you
Couldn’t be me
CHAT PLS DON'T DIE
One of the big problems that society has to confront is that intense competition in school and work is causing people to stop thinking about love. South Korea has that problem so they set a maximum workweek of 52 hours
52 is still a lot
heck i'm not working that much
Medical interns and bankers in the USA often have 80-90 hour weeks
sad for them
online school goes brrr
That’s why I chose to not pursue cs because I can’t sit at a desk all day and do work
sigh
What career do you want? Most CS majors will spend most of their day staring at a screen
Regardless, any corporate job you have will have you stare at a screen for a long time
who says corporate job
I'm reading right now about how sitting all day is bad for your health :cursed_flushed:
I'm reading how thinking that something is bad for you makes it worse
Yeah but some corporate jobs don’t pay well
I still dot have it
Fair
I've heard that some of the CS professors here say that they could make a lot more money working for a company but they don't want to do that
Yeah because the corporate world sucks
i just wanna get into fintech for 2 years and then leave
I'm okay with working 70+ hours a week as long as it's work I care about
Nah I want some balance in my life
wtf
no you arent
I was born the last day of the first month of the last year of the last millennium
Long work hours are normal in finance, especially hedge funds and investment banking
Quick maths
2+2 is 4, - 1 is 3 quick maths
yea but why would someone work for 70+ hours a week
i rather die than work this long
I finished my first year and still dunno how to plan as a pre med
well Raunak didn't say same lol
wasnt tryoing to call out anyopne
Raunak u canceled, sorry to say
Do we have to have a reason to cancel someone? I didn't know that smh
@kaori_flute damn
Raunak called me pretentious now I’m sobbing because I literally don’t have any posts on my LinkedIn😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Man talking about careers makes me so tired
I dont like when people use so many abbreviations or whatever they are called
Those are emojis that don't work on Windows 10 lol
I never use my phone if I'm next to my main computer
My phone is tiny. I have a computer with two monitors, a mouse, and a keyboard
I used to game but not anymore
Damn
Gaming took all of my time and motivation since I was addicted
The many Indians that work seasonally in there
dubai as a country is rich but poor people be like 🤡
It’s soo fucking expensive
I just don't understand why people like doing everything on their phone, it's so difficult to get work done on there. Like how do you write a document or write code?
Not for internationals though
I don’t know how they do it
Damn
Damn
I'm doing some research right now and the program director reminded the professors to not work with anyone from China since the program is funded by the US government
She did nothing back off
but i don't like her
You didn’t even have the guts to ping me with that reply lmao
ah shit
stop with this weeb shit
dang i wish
Ayo you said OwO to me once don’t even
Sorry but this is a just server
I mean I understand if you don't agree with him but calm down a bit smh
i sleepy
Every tweet from him gets so much hate because he talked about Covid regulations
Yeah didn't he sign an abortion bill or something?
I’m upset that Dr. Amy Acton was bullied into quitting her job
I hope that in the coming decades the crazy right-wing extremism is gone
That won’t happen
Because this world sucks
Sigh my parents were right it’s a bad world out there
Hate and deceit everywhere
Where's "left wing extremism" in this country
Oh no where
Because the “radical left” in this country is actually centrist on a global scale
I wasn’t making a speech
I only said extreme left so that no one here would get offended
Fair
Ok so imma take back the extreme left part because I never actually meant it
I want right-wing extremism gone in the coming decades
Sadly
isnt extremism on either sides bad?
I don't think there will be a growth in any particular ideology
The extreme left here in the US is centrist in global politics
But late capitalism will further accelerate
I don't think America is very conservative culturally either but
in india, we see america was very left
but then is just not extreme left if it is centrist objectively
I never bought into the idea of culturally "left" or "right"
Cuz if they mean anything
If you want conservatism, go to Asia, South Korea and China are all more conservative than the US
Hate to speak hegel here but any ideology must live in an economical fundamental
I forgot, I refuse to elaborate, I leave
I mean where can you go to get a hot dog and a drink for just $1.50
They sell things for cheap but still make so much revenue annually
Really? I thought they don't use preservatives
I think most hotdogs are pretty bad lol
do we have one near campus?
Not really
organic food aint that much better
Nothing in America is real anymore in terms of food
These companies are slowly killing us I stg
There's no way Costco is making a profit off of those hot dogs tho
They aren’t. But they make up for it in other ways
They don't make money on it, it's to get people into the store. It's called a loss leader
Anyway, I still go there for my eye checkups😌
IKEA and Costco are both brilliant for serving food inside of massive stores
Really? Do you have a source?
I’ve bought stuff from Costco where I was left utterly disappointed with the quality
I don’t buy electronics from Costco just in case
Not really
not really
but my situation is even worse cause im veg
sigh
Cooking isn’t terribly difficult
Unless you’re raunak and can’t even turn on a stove
fair
Lol I'm reading about the nervous system, apparently there's a "rest and digest" in addition to "fight or flight"
I need to continue breaking bad though
saw what, the time? shoot it's late imma head out
Why is Tchaik 6 so sad 😢
I can't understand how dumb I am sometimes
I didn't see the submit button for the I-20 document which takes at least 10 days to process, 10 days have passed, I signed to check what has happened but I noticed that I didn't press the submit button
@quintus_fabius_ I believe the reason why 123movies can fuck you up is because it is technically against the acceptable use policy, so if case finds out that you use it then they can pursue disciplinary action. Normally they wouldn't check (I believe), but if their isp finds out and sends an angry letter, which can happen, they can figure out what happened.
internet service provider. like xfinity
damn note taken
but I guess that's not for what we think it should work
I use their vpn a bit. But case's vpn goes to their network, so they can still see all your traffic. You need a vpn from a third party if you wanna do sketcy shit
I only use their VPN if I'm trying to access a site that I cannot do off campus
it's more likely they will send an angry letter if you host streaming for those movies on a server connected to case wifi. Once my brother did this, burned almost one tb of data in less than a month, and xfinity was pissed
Personally I would just use a private google drive account to host movies, but my brother likes to do everything the hard way hence setting up his own server
~~he is applying to cmu though, which is too close~~
he wants to go to university of washington
123movies is a streaming service, they can’t do anything about that xd
but sometimes you can consume things way past then. Haven't done it with milk yet but don't plan on it
so the listed date doesnt matter all the much
but with most things the expiration date like doesnt matter at all
No gym or exercise done so far so can't say so.
and didn't you carry all your stuff across campus :thonk: ?
The milk from plum market curdled in no time and tasted so bad. Within 3 days, it wasn't tasting great so I chucked it. WalMart milk is good
oh shit
Sometimes when I leave too much in the jar, it condenses to cheese
now i doubt u'll do that as a college student
That reminds me of cooking pasta. If you want to know if pasta is cooked, just throw it at a wall and see if it sticks
If you want to know if the duck is thoroughly cooked, throw it against the wall and see if it quacks
Hmm I dont think I have ever been to an aldi's before
Bruh, I dont think there are any in northern cali or utah
fuck you im a born again southerner
@chandachan when i come to beat you up, just know I can reduce the time it takes to get to houston from 13.5 hours to 8 hours by barreling down the highway in my red doge pickup at 90mph
I live near an Aldi and have never been there
@raunakwastaken five rupees, take it or leave it
It’s not specific to India though
It was heavily advertised on Indian channels here though
Now I know though
We're in the study lounge 💀
Idk
@everyone i'm tired
But why tho
literally nothing has changed
but why not tho
Nothing of your concern
damn
Tbh I don't know since the people I know probably aren't representative of Houston in general. I don't think anecdotes are good enough to tell
Why aren’t they representative of Houston do you think?
watch as tippit becomes the worst dorm to live next year
Because I heard so many Californians are moving to Texas since it’s cheaper
Like who wants to live here
Not just California. Half of all homes listed in America for sale are sold within a week right now https://www.zillow.com/research/days-to-pending-april-2021-29511/
There are a lot of places in live in the city that aren't loud
Not here tho
Like traffic laws are hardly enforced in India and then everyone gets annoyed at each other and start honking excessively
wow u forgot already
I still don’t get it
i don't get the joke 🤡
Ayo we don’t kill cows
whoever sleeps longer wins
*yes, their eyes are closed*
@raunakwastaken for fairness, we're gonna travel 40 hours with no sleep
~~oml i hungry~~
But she’s on campus tho
i be in cle tho :dance_HappyVibe:
Then why travel 40 hours
cuz my last trip from palestine was 40 hours
Hmm isn’t Palestine way closer to America than India is?
It takes a while to leave Palestine itself?
Because I didn’t see an airport on the Palestinian map
Also, it’s not that I won’t sleep at all in that 40 hours lol
I would hardly sleep since I can only sleep well in a bed
But apparently I can sleep on a ride but I know for a fact I only sleep well in a bed
i can get an hour total on a 10-hour flight
Jet lag will be pain
nah it was just being exhausted
u don't wanna pee on the plane do u?
cuz seat is gonna be dirty?
I’ve been to the Canada side of Niagara Falls but people told me that doesn’t count
I don’t have such weakness /s
Also those bathrooms be crammed holy crap
and it can smell horrible if someone had to poo
Seats aren’t that bad tho
Everything is bad
an international flight
it can get very bad
Okay tbh I’ve never sat on a plane toilet so nvm me
This one time I had to shit in America and had to use toilet paper. Hated it
I’m simple not gonna shit
We don’t have those sprinkle thingies like you do in India
never used one lol
i wonder why they arent common here
how does that reduce the need for toilet paper...
Oh it was just a statement
i mean, i would not want to use the sprinkle thing in a public bathroom here
When the pandemic surged last year, no Indian family freaked out over toilet paper
but what if you need to poop...
Then I read wrong
I’ll only poop in a public bathroom if I know I can’t hold it in any longer
Shit on the floor
y'all if u wanna see the worst public bathrooms come to between borders
nah it's worse
worse
worse
The boys bathroom sucks everywhere
fair
smaller lines tho right
lmao i have never been in the line for the bathroom
but its a meme that like, if youre trying to not be heard, like in the middle of the night, you aim to the side so you dont hit the water so theres no splash
idk why I didn't think of that until right now
wdym I see absolutely no problems with this
then it would hit the toilet paper
and might clog tho
trying not to be heard
also, who says you cant take that tp out and re-use it later?
Howdy, you aren't a dog
i'm already questioning it
omg people were celebrating reagan's death
yeah my aunt set her ringtone to "ding dong the witch is dead" when he died
As much as I didn’t like him as a politician, that’s disrespectful
still waiting for the trickle down
Fair
idk
we haven't lol
fuck u
the thing about betrayal is that it never comes from an enemy
and think about the fact that you were gone the whole semester
So many big brains in my HS. It's mad
nah not the whole semester
only 2 months
LOL, nah i transferred here spring semester and i was a lil shy at first since i didn't know anyone lmao
Leave shyness away
because you cant not
College decision process for Indian parents is a whole different trip
"why didn't u apply to harvard"
Thankfully my parents aren’t that crazy, but I know people who parents crazy compare
i be tired
my friend's mom literally threw herself in front of a principal's car to beg him to admit his son
“Did you see Sandeep uncle become CIO of Microsoft? Why aren’t you at that level yet?”
cuz no one cares what some rando is doing
"YOU DOCTOR YET?" "No dad, I'm 12" "TALK TO ME WHEN YOU DOCTOR"
yes same, they were not that bad
i'm still sane
My parents don't fit it but sometimes they can be like that. My grandparents, however. What's your percentage/ranking etc.
my parents are alright too sometimes i think they didn't push me enough though
My nana will literally interrupt my mom on the phone and ask how I’m doing in school :cursed_flushed:
mmm i don't think i'd ever discussed grades with my grand parents
I told them ranking system doesn't exist many times. Explaining IB system took ages that my dad stole the phone and said 90th percentile as if I was top 10% in the world or smth
I only discuss with my maternal grandfather since he went all military school on my mom and aunt when it came to school
Mine are dead
Oh. Sorry to hear that
Once I told my nana how I was struggling in pre Calc and he lectured my mom on how to teach me math
She’s like yayyyy school
I haven't spoken to grandparents for a long time actually, since I've come to campus.
I haven’t spoken to my grandfather in a while too
It’s 1 am and I gotta wake up early imma sleep
~~mine 2 years ago, granddad a couple of months ago~~
I don't play multiplayer games anymore
@moseslee I don't have that game, but what's your steam
why are you up this early
I’m tired
i'm tired too
i dont understand why alums donate back to unis
They do it to help their school become better, and who doesn’t want that?
yeah but they've taken SO MUCH MONEY FROM US
Your school gave you an education, so some feel like giving back to their school
So it’s a trade off I guess
And I think people who genuinely think they benefited from attending their college would donate money if they have the means to
What other places though? Charities?
Research is actually a good outlet too since many diseases need cures that need to be developed
The biggest setback researchers face in many areas is funding. You can’t do adequate research if you don’t have funding, so donations like these can help
Didn't the FDA approve its first drug treating Alzheimer's today in like 20 years?
Apparently it was a controversial decision
Also I didn't know you composed
Oh noooooo
Shit
Oh shit
I need to write another one
Cuz I wasn't expecting the wagner connection, I thought that might have been traumatic
I don't listen to much Wagner though lol
That, I personally don't think so
Idk
Music sucks in general
i last played shostakovich for my grade 5 exam
Shostakovich wasn't really known to be a piano composer unfortunately
I didn't play anything by him
I played a bit of Prokofiev tho
Prokofiev is mad based
My fingers can't handle it
fuck i'm tryna connect with obama on linkedin but i gotta know his email
how do u know its sex tho
Apple just announced that they won’t allow all these Mail trackers to work anymore
So I can’t use that chrome extension then
I don't use Apple Email 😳
I don’t care
What if the professor is using it tho
You never know
Smh Apple I just lost some respect for you
Universities won’t be able to track anymore :ThanosUgh:
I was watching the event. Idk the link
I haven’t checked the tracker in a while
Since I’m mostly on my phone and iPad now
Kinda bummed MacBooks weren’t announced
That’s a rip
Probably a missing assembly reference or something
That is a good hypothesis, but much of it because I'm trying to commit a bunch of files that are referencing methods that aren't defined. There have been times when the Java Development Kit associated with my projects wasn't working and I got hundreds of errors in a few files though
did you try taking a break from programming and never coming back?
the article didnt support ur claims as much as you hoped didnt it
I realized that posting a short summary of the claims is better than posting a wall of text that nobody is going to read
smh it's so simple. just program a bot to program all your programs and you won't need to program anymore programs
@raunakwastaken the crazy shit with that one is astrazeneca bluetooth connection
and they need a much bigger needle to inject it
Fair enough, but in what interest would others willingly implant microchips in vaccine recipients?
It’s too early
i want a microchip
I want my microchip hooked up to find my friends
omg
actually like the kidnapper can break my phone but how will they find the microchip 🤔🤔
Them chips still don't transmit tho
It is way easier for me to track you over your phone than microchip
Reminds me of that missed connections post
To store passports and money and shit
cuz someone def is gonna wanna steal your visa
how early are you coming raunak?
cuz it's probably cheaper
oh that
is actually not terrible
I leave on the 14th
I actually save 10.5 hours since I’ll be flying west
oh so just a few days early
OMG I MOVE IN 2 MONTHS FROM TODAY
Yea but what if someone breaks in
yeah cuz i want your visa
kinda hard to get past those
ik some people leave their doors open but if you don't then you're good
if someone can get through 3-4 locked doors without notice, they dont care about ur wallet
i want some
They r some serious gourmet shit, though sometime not brewed properly
i would just play with the weird handle all the time tho
mine made a terrible creaking noise when i spinned it
it freaked me out at first bc i moved it and then i couldn’t get my drawer open
Oh isn't that just south side desks
Those r tiny tho
Just cuz u getting a kitchen?
i cant remember… 207 or something i think
I’m in the study lounge
don’t be stomping late at night🔪🔪🔪
Oh no
Is it too close to the entrance? Will I hear people?
ACTUAL COLLEGE BAYBEEEE
and then closed off to give you a bathroom area
Wtf is this building
Oh
that I dont know
idk
maybe they dont mark kitchen
Aren't some suites in Tippit also mixed gender
everyone would like a clean bathroom
We shit on the floor
😔 dam rlly thought it would work this time
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 new emoji wtf
i’m just playing with u guys. my million dollar scam didn’t work this time
Oh
shit which one of y’all started passing the cooties around again😷😷
u never heard that in elementary school?
I didn't even speak English in elementary school
oh true forgot not everyone is from ohio
But I still dont speak Ohio
What makes u think Europe tho
idk that just the first country i thought of
i guess i could get long bread at walmart though
That's when "culture" didnt imply "value"
Narrow it down by countries with *implications*✨✨ which doesn’t actually help much
Which country isn’t cringe
Fuck you
No I just genuinely can’t tell
depends of much you want to spend
you'd need a budget
price isn't an issue
Damn
I’m leaving on that day
Back in where I'm from u can stay somewhere real fancy for the money of holiday Inn
That means I'm just gonna find a sugar momma for the summers
Some tried to follow me on insta😳
Aren't u a she
I was surprised when they tried to follow me
Isn’t the only skill needed for being a sugar baby just existing?
Existing is hard ok leave us alone
Lol fair enough
omg some old guy on insta wanted me to be his sugar baby
If you don’t show up by then, they’re gonna assume you ain’t coming
That makes me curious what would happen if someone showed up the day after that. Are they not allowed into the housing? Do they get a refund?
They aint getting no refund
Meaning there won't be any shows in Strosacker 😜
I’m so sleepy what the heck
subnautica devs are bad at spelling smh
Fk myself. I thought this won't be too bad.
Something always goes wrong near end game
I need to work on that
Oh I wasn't responding to you lol I was responding to Ansh
Oh
Oh yh. I forgot. I had my second lab today and will have third lab on Thursday 😀
I don't understand?
The thing is in my HS, we discussed about this very briefly but all chapters connect in a way except Ch 2 (Acids and Bases) plus everything is in way more detail now
Ouch
Yikes, that looks horrible
i went to sleep :LAUGHING:
Dang you went to bed early
yea i was tired OwO
Like u want to wake up with baid in ur mouth?
that;s not too bad
Having hair in your mouth is annoying
Shedding hair sucks too
I’ll be chillin and then I’ll feel a tickle on my arm and boom a piece of hair fell out
Nothing beats Race 3 bro 😂. That's the worst it can get
I didn’t watch it because it looked bad
Honestly the reason why I never watched bad Indian movies is because 1. I got lucky with the ones I chose to watch at the movie theaters and most of them were big hits and 2. I’d read about how they sucked
How bad is it
Who leaves their half-eaten pizza in their car uncovered
Yh, the times were that bad. It has such a good cast but Remo can't direct for shit
> It has such a good cast
no it does not. it literally has salman khan and he can't act shit
Radhe wasn't that bad but I saw it on yomovies. I like the zoom zoom song
oh yea you don;t have access to hotstar do you?
oh damn
You'd have to wake up damn early for that
shit
@ansh8867 will you come to pick me up at the airport?
You're coming alone
Uhhh I think Calc 3 was manageable in 3 weeks cause calc 3 honestly did not have a large amount of content in it
i should've taken calc 3. i would've had the same prof
i could've shown med schools that i was a big brain in math ✊ 😔
oh whale 🤪
i didn't learn like anything
it was sad
if i could go back in time i'd look for clark's math 223 class
and do it w/ someone else
i wish i had your professor
So Clark is the best math professor
i don't see him anywhere on sis for this fall tho
cuz 126 doesn't have a prof assigned yet
fair
ok work time toodles
Mmm. IB calc wasn't too difficult but I used to be shit at math
If what his Linear Algebra students say is true you won't be disappointed
wtf some isreali guy asked if I went there on birthright yet 🤮
her vids are rlly good at explaining concepts and she goes thru the exact problems on quizzes at her office hours… tho the final exam kinda sucks
Though I don’t know if he’s teaching this fall
Idk, I took his difeq
I took math 126 aka CAS calc 2
However, I will say that I didn’t study for his final until the night before and almost panicked during his exam
All these cwru grad pics are having me realize that I didn’t meet a single ‘21 in real life
Yeah, that's the worst part about online college, that you don't get to actually meet anyone
well idk diff EQ has certain concepts that can be challenging.
But my HW grade was so bad
For math
Troy never collected our homework
Speedbirdconcorde2 said that his math prof was Troy and gave him a 20% on his homework :cursed_flushed:
I’m sorry :((
Wtf
We had “homework” in that he encouraged us to do practice problems from the textbook
@speedbirdconcorde2 was your homework graded on completion or accuracy?
My guess is accuracy?
Since it’s college
Though I hardly completed most of them
In the two math classes with homework I've had so far, one was half accuracy and half completion and the other one was "10 tries on WebAssign for each question" 😂
jk never had to use it
and hopefully never will
She lectured at CWRU School of Medicine
Why do I feel like crying after reading this message though
I want to become a super hero just like them
who doesn't want to be like Magneto?
so why aren't you already magnetized?
> so why aren't you already magnetized?
@syberkonda 
Must be the 5g waves cancelling out the effects of the metal in vaccines.
That's why they don't make 5G phones out of metal
Um if the vaccine turns me into Magneto why the fuck would I _not_ take it
Well bad news guys
There’s a fork in my head now
oh no
All the people behind her nodding their heads was scary
oh
Although Butler never asks you to evaluate the integrals
Since most of the integrals are trig sub
Series and sequences was probably the only thing I genuinely understood in BC but my test score didn’t reflect that oopsies
holy shit my parents won't be able to come
Well shit
travelling alone ain't it
fuck
There are people at the airports who can help you if you need it
You couldn’t find flights where you only had 2 stops…?
i don't know anyone there
Just make sure you don't fall asleep during delays
Whenever you want to wake up your whole dorm or floor you blast that song in the corridors at 7 am
Lmao. Still better than waking up to phone alarms, which can't stop on voice command also
So you only have 2 stops which isn’t bad
Unless they lose one of your bags
i have to apparently change airports at chicago which will be pain
thats not too bad bruh
wait shit he's in texas my bad
I don't know yet. I don't think both will but one might
i would really like an o week now
They’re working on it
He was born in the area and lived there until he went to college
nothing, just putting things in context
Because all David said was that his dad left Ohio for college, in that he went to MIT for his degrees, which is very impressive regardless of when he attended
So the idea of getting accepted doesn’t really need to come into play
cause it was rude
Cause immigration
Immigration sucks
oh you're trying to come BACK
And didn’t have to do it in OHare
Looking at flights and it seems like I'll probably have my stop in ATL
He hasn't seen campus at all. It's his first time after virtual year
omg
i've been on this discord for a year and i haven't been on campus yet
Oh, is that why Class of 2025 is so large? Because it has a lot of people that were accepted last year but deferred?
This is from the email I got
> Due to the size of the incoming first-year class, which is higher than anticipated, we have made the decision to house these additional students in Clarke Tower up to the 9th floor. This will allow them to be connected with all of the other first-year students living in Clarke Tower.
But they still have a lot of freshmen
Where did you find this information?
Last year it was 29% and this year it’s 27% I think
I can't believe that Clarke Tower up to 9th floor is first-years
Clarke is not too bad also. Huge upgrade from  Hitchcock
Really?
I like the vibe there tho
Maybe they fixed it. Yh, the community is nice but I can't really explore the social scene much
omg salmon
I haven't been to Seattle yet :cursed_flushed:
These cicadas are so annoying
damn
shit gets wild when the cicadas come out
Haven't seen a single cicada yet and I live in a forest
I was looking through my rapid chess stats on chess.com and apparently I have lost 100% of the games I have played white in and I have won 100% of the games I have played black in
I could be wrong though
i cant remember what my sisters bf said it was… something on the PS4 i think
i think that’s what it is… either that or it’s bird tv for mara to sleep to
Games don't have humans in them
You wish you were as long as her
sad😔
omg really
omg i don’t wanna hit mara
I don’t wanna hit hit
Oh rip
i wish tho bc they would be big round little babies
Hard to explain
mara doesn’t like other cats :(
I wish I had a pet
Sigh
Sometimes I wish I had a pet
i want one for dorm
I just want a pet for companionship
rip her
Except she can be playfully viscous so I doubt I’ll be successful
right i’m jealous of julia
OH yesterday some people at work thought I was a rising junior in hs
I’ve never been told that I looked young for my age
bruh same happened to me a few days ago
it always happens to me bc i’m so short💔
Rip
im tall though and it still happens
~~happened to me today~~
when i say i’m a college student people are like “omg u don’t even look old enough to drive”
Do I really have a babi face??????????? Because I’ve never been mistaken for a younger person before
i don’t think so pri
u def don’t look old or grown tho
Like when I was 13 someone thought I was 16
omg
could get into scary movies .
And my parents said I looked 2 years older than my age growing up and now I don’t. I look my age
I can’t believe I’ll be 2 decades old next year wtf
right it doesn’t feel like we’ve been alive that long
damn
sometimes ppl say they hate their birthday for dif reasons but idk
I’m not really a party person because I didn’t go to many parties. Like last time I had a bday party I cried before it started LOLLLLLL
Also I’m lame
Which explains why I don’t celebrate so much
RIGHT it makes me anxious like. what if ppl didn’t have fun
i feel like it used to be all exciting and now it’s just another year
And in middle school I didn’t throw parties
Since we are near a krispy kremey
mmm we should do that in college classes !
i don’t want anyone to eat my face
that scary
Lol that’s fair
u'd see someone with your eye
mmm i never did that
Valentine’s Day is annoying if you’re single
pain💔
valentine’s day was made up wasnt it
Yeah to upset us singles
it’s coming pri… don’t settle for anything less
Tyty though my standards are high which is ugh
Yeah I don’t want a toxic relationship at all
they didn;t hire any professors this yeat
oh dang
it was supposed to be lifted in may
My math 126 prof was new this past year
ya i when i was younger i would date boys just bc they were cute and didn’t at all think about if they actually cared ab me or not… wish i didn’t have to go theu that
omg king
aren't you dating someone rn or am i thinking about someone else?
Oh I couldn’t date because of my parents also no guy wanted me so
nah aidan and i broke up
Aw really?
I’m sorry :(
oh F
aww :(
Fuck yeah
Dear ladies, we are hot affffff🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
I did that once in hs and it was just a fling and I couldn’t last past 2 months
Hs relationships don’t even last
At least most don’t
She probably had contact with boys outside of school though…?
ya i mean if ur one of the lucky ones they can but that shit be hard asf
it's not like i *never* came across hs guys
fat cats
omg
Sorry 😢
how much money you have?
i'm sorry then
we need someone to buy us the fat cats
i wish we had a cat cafe on campus
huh i wont do without cat
OH
there are so many bad jokes i have with cats omg
aight imma go back to sleep hf
seriously though I saw that in theaters and it scarred me for life
idk it was cats introducing themselves for two hours with scary visuals
Oh
it was really boring
cameron aren’t they like human cats
the movie cats was the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs
Wtf
oh I thought john oliver said that for some reason
oh I'm trying to get banned from this scam discord
oh we need to raid some servers again
basically you buy fake land for a game that hasn't been made yet and nobody has any information about
I haven't managed it yet
but honestly I want to see what happens
people are trying and failing to get their money out of this mess
wait that is actually sad
idk
rip
oh i got banned there
why what happened?
does anyone want to play jackbox?
@absence000 do you want to play jackbox?
do you want to play jackbox?
did any mac user here get cwru's vpn if so how cuz my smol brain be strugglin
cuz i did it once, my laptop won't let me even open it
and case's website isn't helping me
cuz i scrolled and didn't find the instructions
so far i got it to open
Much of the time you can right click and click open and instead Finder will ask “it’s damaged you sure you wanna open?” instead of left click ==> “can’t open”
it didn't let me log in last semester
why do you need the vpn tho>
i need to access my lab's server
nah she said i could do the work from home and that it was up to me if i wanted to come to campus or not
and i could've gone to do some actual lab work but meh
idk
ok now my mac won't let me connect to this server skjdbc'
virtual - can be accessed remotely
private - closed system
network - connected to system
You need to add your password with a hashtag at the end to get a ping to your phone
My grad student never told me about that
Well crap
Kinda Strange that they didn't inform you about that
I ended up signing up for that anat 401 class ppl got emailed about
Is it required for anybody working with rats or is this specific to Ansh's lab?
Cause I have a feeling that even with a surgery I won’t be able to hit the 6 feet mark
I need to get my height measured
I wasn’t the shortest
You probably would've been the shortest over here in America tho lol
That’s nothing SMH
Why are you worried about the height though? It doesn't matter much
Last time I measured I was 173cm
Idk why but for some odd reason my mom wanted me to be 5’7 or 5’8
I legit don't know 😂
I don't pay attention to height unless you're incredibly shorter or taller than me so don't ask me 😂
bruh what i did my math wrong?
Isn’t 1 inch 2.54 cm?
idk it's one inch off according to google calculator
close enough ig
OMG
Short boi
rip
just head
if it helps my sister *may* end up taller than me but idk yet
Even I forgot he has one
Yeah. He got his master's degree in economics a few weeks ago
Someone is keeping tabs 👀
I once forgot my birthday
i wish i had an older sibling
someone to look up to 😔
Really?
raunak has never felt more relieved
isnt sarah 4'9
im not even tall and i don't want it banned
There's a famous research paper about a height tax https://www.nber.org/papers/w14976
raunak couldn't resist leaving his est friends for the summer
then why are you still up
you miss us don't you
It was French open semi finals just now
You don’t need to know that
oh yea we were crossing the street yesterday
some people don't deserve driving rights
im talking to those who don't use their turn signals
and other bad drivers
also people who drive slow annoy me
unless there's a legit reason why they are
I wish there was better public transport
some simply don't deserve driving rights
Some people do lose their driver's license if they do something wrong
some don't tho
because they don't get caught
i feel so helpless when i fill up gas
sigh
Using a car isn't optional in most parts of America though
hence why i feel helpless
if i had the option i'd use an electric car
and i understand electricity still burns fossil fuels
yeah that's fair
i don't have my own car
I don’t think that much will change in 3 years sad to say
It’s not supposed to show correlation I don’t think
So it's theoretically possible for deaths per VMT to decline but total deaths to still increase because of an increase in miles traveled and population
some people should've never passed those driving tests
It’s not that driving tests are too easy it’s just that you can’t really test if someone’s gonna be a safe driver
Driving slowly is fine by me but you shouldn't be an idiot e.g. speed up when I'm trying to pass you
SOMEONE DID THAT TO ME TODAY AND HONKED AT ME
I went to Michigan for a short vacation and I saw in total 2 police cars from south Michigan all the way to the Upper Peninsula
Meanwhile, in Toledo alone (on the highway) I saw 5 police cars
People be driving 20+ over speed limit and still getting tailgated
idk if cops get money off of the tickets they give out but if so then they're just after us for the money
damn
Compared to Ohio, which is 65/70 tho :cursed_flushed:
Oh same
ty AP gov class 😌
Texans don't crae
I think I almost never go on that highway since I almost never go from Austin to San Antonio
Oh yh, people in US are allowed to drive at 16 itself
I want to start learning this summer
15 and a half you can get your permit and drive with parents
Damn, in India it's till 18 or so
and in NY specifically you can drive to school on your own with a learner's permit
but only school
I've been stopped before so I'm not taking my chances
Honestly could've been racial profiling, idk
They stopped me because after 10 years of driving the same car apparently someone changed my car's color from "dark gray" to "maroon"
In fact, it saves time. @sprinkles2108 Are you getting the car to campus?
my dad has been stopped too but he was legit like in his early 30's with a 1998 toyota camery
i don't have my own, *own*, car
I don't trust my driving abilities enough
like for example you can't drive w/ non relatives and there is a curfew
teens suck at driving
Tbh that's not even a risk tho, because most people do that
fair
Lol I think that's withe everything tho
I tend to underestimate everything I do, except it's for the resume or for those applications 😎
honestly i wish i learned how to overhype myself up
cuz like life ain't fair
Lol I wasn't good at it either
It's hard to brag about yourself
then it's not hard
oh i didn't watch it ope
I never had mine tested, my honest guess would be probably 115-125
it's been 7 years since i took an official IQ test at my middle school
Idk but I think SD is 15, no?
Idk what my iq is but it’s probably not very high
I hate those stupid pattern puzzles
i think my IQ went down since middle school
IQ tends to stay static tho, unless you do drugs or whatever
I'm horrible at chess :cursed_flushed:
i've seen this trend. someone who went to my hs qualified for the international chess tournament and is now at Brown University
All I need is a projector
I have a feeling she might on campus if there are sellers nearby. You never know
Cool cat hates drugs
Doubt that have benzodiazepine tho
sadly they don't
We want the return of Clifford
idk when i'll change it
I remember you changed it because you "wanted to look professional"
All I know is my OChem teacher's family is big brain. Husband is Biomedical engineer, daughter is senior in Harvard and got Rhodes Scholarship this year, teacher has 2 phd's in analytical chemistry and another one and has fulbright/nehru award. That's mad
cuz i was sorta a mentor ish
i wish
" "You can have a PhD and still be an idiot" - Richard Feynman" - Me
accurate tho
Those who study less and perform could be smarter. I was seeing theory of everything and Hawking put 1 hour a day studying only
I forgot what the expression was tho
Take the culture fair intelligence test
lol yeah those tests don't seem incredibly accurate
I procrastinated a lot . 😒. Back to work
Sadly I’m not smart enough to study material within 2 hours🥲
You have many achievements that even "smart" people don't have so it doesn't matter much.
yeah the online ones ain't shit
I feel like intelligence is more subjective
dont u start that too moses
It must help with getting more people to click on it but idk
It’s just advertising really
Nothing beats Badtameez Dil tho
if you disagree i will sentence you to death and carry out the execution myself
death in 3
i'm a reasonable man. i will let you choose your method of dying
you're a dead man raunak
Oh facts
oh?
It's completely clean
*shame*
This song is stuck in my brain now
I need to do some HW and we're on Chapter 6 currently but I'm oddly getting used to the pace
She won't cover any other Chapters except Chapter 6 which we have to do over weekend and she'll discuss on Monday I think.
Coz Thursday is the exam, part of which is on canvas and the other is take home
always include date name and title of exp (I lost one mark in my pre-lab coz of this and it's not even included in the rubric) . Other than that, it's fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWQpb6T89d4 (This song is stuck in my brain)
Chapter 5 is giving me a panic attack. It's painful doing it without molecular models so I'm moving to Ch 6 in 10 mins now.
@ansh8867 you taking a summer class?
I don't rly listen to country, but I listen to eurobeat for driving. U want some of that?
Oh shit
I just realized Case's official ig follows one of my accounts
oh dang
Apparently cuz I'm a "social media ambassador" but I haven't turned anything in for months
If my pre-med advisor complains, I'll tell him I wanted to focus on research and take a break from studying
Plus imagine 11 chapters in 3 weeks. It's just madness. He was telling me to take both lectures because my fall schedule had some major clashes. To reduce my efforts, I took Ochem 1 lecture in summer. On top of that, I added lab at the last moment due to clashes. That I discussed in the group also. David remembers @_frostyyyyy_
People don't wear spectacles
There's still people that believe wearing specs will make ur eye sight worse
there are uncles and aunties that blame weak eyes on the person's parents and claim they failed to nurture their child properly
idk about book
and idk how they're different in terms of content
But @Deleted User said she's not too bad also as people say. Plus we'll be in the same class and suite next sem
No I fell asleep at 4 am 😂 😂
those were a pain in the ass
oh
or her idk
and then reading the math tb
i'm gonna try 323 if need be i'll go back to 223
only part that was bad in 223 were like the last 2 units
Bro Oswin, we're already on Chapter 6 rn. Nothing beats that pace
this is why im not taking summer classes because im slow 😎
fast-paced courses in the summer ain't it
I wish I had the choice not to take any 😭
pain
that is unfortunate. so which class are you taking this summer?
i don't think i'm having her this fall but i may have her in the spring
last i heard she's gonna be on maternity leave
i heard she's excellent tho
He stopped coming after the 2nd lecture so I don’t remember
Don’t remember this one
i just want to have a general idea of the content before i dive into several STEM courses this fall
^ idk if another edition’s gonna come out in the next few months but that’s the neur 201 book if anyone wants it
Damn, Irene went kinda deep into each gen chem topic so we could “explain it the way she wanted” on the exam
After that it was basically dead weight
Helped me visualize it tho b/c I’m a little slow with orienting stuff in 3d
ouch oof my head
But Dr. Shri is more understanding towards students Sometimes, she'll delay the deadline for HW or tell us what exactly to do by next lecture. However, there comes a time we have to screenshot some questions in the lecture that she'll discuss the next day and I'm confident the exam will be hard
There's one take home component also that's open book but 43 marks are closed book only
Oo speaking of HW, Irene is really lenient (well, was online at least) with homework deadlines, like I have a friend that turned in his really last minute and she still graded them. They’re also fully completion based because we have an answer key to the TB.
When’s your first exam?
after work tomorrow im gonna watch videos of rats 😌
I was supposed to be for a summer program but some stuff came up and I had to come back
luckily my work is entirely computational based so I can still continue, but it sucks b/c I love Cleveland’s weather compared to NV
oh so you're still able to take part in the program?
damn they’re really slacking on the fortunes
oh boi
this is why i can't live there
yeah i was in delhi during november one year when it wasn't even that hot and i hated it
The weather over there is unbearable as well as the air toxicity.
I can't imagine 115, 95 already feels miserable
I remember that you had a door opening to the balcony, so it should be convenient for you to step outside at night and feel the breeze
Don't most house plans in Houston have an accessible balcony on the second floor?
ZHANDA appears on DAVID'S balcony.
ZHANDA enters on the balcony.
But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and ZHANDA is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou, his maid, art far more fair than he.
Be not his maid since he is envious.
His vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off!
It is my kind sir. Oh, it is my love.
Oh, that he knew he were!
He speaks, yet he says nothing. What of that?
nope
They tried something new
Sad song actually
Last one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooi7g1ML1Bo (before a math exam)
oh no
Bye
oh i miss that movie
The end is very abrupt, legit did the couple eventually go to the swimming park? Did the old master find peace? Did the teacher of cobra kai get in trouble for the bad conduct he was teaching?
idk what u mean by did he find peace
The girl wanted to go there, he said they would go, and we never knew
is there any reason they wouldnt go
i wont spoilt it
I guess I will have to, to stop being kungfused
don't spread the kung flu
idk they seem dumb to me tbh
ofc i've never seen it
dang Ned Beatty died
I'm surprised you know who he was since you don't watch a lot of movies
I don't even know who Ned Beatty is
I don’t know who he is. My dad does
I don’t even know
Last time I did was thanksgiving
I catch little bits of what my dad watches but I've never actually sat down and watched a full one with him
I hear him watching them below my room tho
Mine usually doesn’t
And admit they don’t know much about them
My dad knows the whole Sholay movie by heart. Apparently, he used to hear it on the casette also
I'm watching masti rn. Stereochemistry gives headache 🧠 🔥
I'm genuinely frightened. There's so much work 😭
My dad's in some machine learning division now in Uber. Inspiring to see how he still has stamina to do 6 hour consecutive meetings
"Able to hit buildings at a single bound" ?
To half a year of tuition
holy shit
Holy crap the cicadas are going insane
They’re worse in my neighborhood
There are dead ones littering the parking lot
Why does Tochtrop have such a dead voice. I hate the monotonous voice. It makes me 😴
For someone here that would be useful
Because that could really help them out
Holy shit
Wtf the prizes are amazing now
I have LOT of work today. I barely scrape time to have a bath
I would find time to go if I were there
I already met a friend for an hour yesterday and saw movie so need to do some catchup from yesterday as well as current work for the day
Actually they closed today, going tmrw
"Food deprived?" Just call it "hungry" lol
That's what happens to a hungry person. He becomes inaccurate and randomly vents
Hunger usually doesn’t make me angry
Can't think straight when I'm hungry. Especially not eating anything since morning
I wish
If you are just incredibly annoying for a continuous amount of time
Feels that energy levels have been depleted and feels the human impulse to replenish his chemical energy reservoir
do we need the vaccinations listed on UHCS website?
Ah crap I need to upload mine
I don’t know
Mines from a year ago rip
I did upload mine a year ago I think but
When I went to upload my Covid vaccine card
Bruh I had to go to the hospital to retrieve my tuberculosis test because it wants it lol
It showed that they were missing my immunization records
I had to email them saying mine wasn't changed
I haven’t gotten any new shots other than Covid in the last year
Did it work?
Also apparently I'm missing a Meningococcal B shot
Oof I didn’t get the flu shot this past year lol
How often people get a flu shot
Yeah I got one dose but apparently I'm supposed to have 2?
Welp it's been 3 years since my last one :cursed_flushed:
Wtf
The current flu shot is only 40% effective, so that’s why I believe we get it annually
You don't get flu shots to prevent the flu, you get them because they make symptoms milder
At least when I took AP psych the teacher said the flu shot is only 40% effective
Lol China didn't care
I don’t think india cared
Oh so it wasn't required
I can’t remember
Does the yellow fever shot have a cost for you guys
The only vaccine in China you need is against all the smoking people do
I feel like I'm going to die from secondhand smoke every time I go
I haven’t been to india in 9 years which is shocking
Maybe wear masks even without Covid?
I’ve heard many people in China do
I have a dear French friend who smokes a lot since 15 once I had a long convo with her she opened up and said how she smokes as some kind of mourning for a family member she lost, it was hard to hear
I’m sorry about your friend
And hard to breath:zoomeyes:
One of my strongest memories of China is walking out of Beijing's International Airport through the sliding double doors and just being hit with a wall of cigarette smoke
People in Shanghai didn't smoke
China has public smoking areas so they can prohibit smoking in public areas, but people literally didn't care
The first thing I smelled when I left the New Delhi airport was smoke and ash🤪
I went to a hospital once and there were 2 guys smoking right next to the no smoking sign 🤦‍♂️
Is drinking or smoking worse
Smoking is worse
Can't comment on that, I think in general Asia has a bad drinking problem lol
Just cuz China doesn't have minimum drinking age
Nah I feel like wrecking your lungs is much worse than wrecking your liver
Don’t wreck any part of your body
U won't get that now
If I *really* had to choose
Actually, there is, it's 18 I believe, but it isn't enforced
I have a theory why it's never a problem in China but smoking is
People don't care
While "smoking bad" was taught at a young age, it becomes cool and edgy to do
smoking looks sexier than drinking I guess
Since I do neither, I sometimes feel like a fascist
Yeah but then bad breath kills every mood
Ironically he died of colon cancer instead of lung
Bruh the smell of weed is horrible tho
So doesn't matter how some try to justify it
What if you just smelled a skunk smoking weed though
Dying of old age>>>>
Well one component is used in medicine for calming chronic pain
You don’t get an INSANE amount every time
really?
Really, weeed has one component that is used as a natural way to calm older people who suffer chronic pain
Bro u ever tried dmt
By that logic isn't the Mary Jane natural?
Go sleep Moses
Keeps me up at night
Not sex at all damn waut
alr enough of Discord today, I need to finish learning about muscles
I need to do a lot of work when I come home
i hate myself everyday
everyday i look and the mirror and feel a vitriol stronger than the previous day's
it takes every ounce of energy in my body not to smash my head into a wall
no need for that double major nonsense
Nope no need
since i'm not majoring
So there is a problem when one consumes DMT, it cannot be assimilated by the body when ingested through the digestive system, researchers had to study and realized that it can only be processed by inhalation or injection. BUT by some strange reason, Amazonian tries know that when ayahuasca is mixed precisely with one specific type of other plant, the DMT can be assimilated by the body by ingestion, which is the way they take it. This is a mystery no one knows how these people knew exactly what plants to mix in order to have a trip when none of them would work separately
Exactly, in the rainforest there's just so many plants it's really odd for you just to land on that mix
Even if so, even if it's just by chance it's crazy to think that could happen
Idk Zhanda brought it up
i never realized ur pfp was actually u
Only 3,260 more people need to upload their vaccination cards to reach the 80% vaccination threshold
@syberkonda this is left field but do you have a sister named sarah that works at KSL? 🤔
india doesn't have iced water
they don't have drinkable water either
I wanted to shitpost in world politics
able to alter the probability of any event occurring
what if i told you im even more manipulative than you are
can't lower the chances if it's a solidified fact
how far above tho please give me a precise measurement
we don't discuss school crap on a college server
they didn't
we gotta find the culprit responsible for this
monke mode is the shit
When attacked, you must throw monke shit
@_frostyyyyy_ I actually don't know who this is
Idk why I asked that
Idk a single Henry
i don't like that much. i'll get some homemade stuff tho
Anyone awake
Maybe it’s because I haven’t taken ochem, but I think the answer to this question is going to depend on the quantity of the strong acid reacting with a certain quantity of the weak base. Strong acids (HA) dissociate completely into H+ and A-, whereas weak bases *partially* dissociate. Given that, however much the weak base dissociates, the H+ will immediately bond with those ions. If I had to make an educated guess, I’d say the right side of the equation (products) will be favored
I think I wrote a lot of smol brain crap so take what I said with a grain of salt
Aren’t you the one self-studying bio and chem this summer
Yeah but i don’t know THIS MUCH
Isn't it when you react strong acid with weak base you get weak conjugate base reacting with weak conjugate acid?
we never get anything strong on the product side as far as I remember
You either end up with a weak acid or a weak base
That was my joke, u didn't get it but ok
I think I've never been to Seattle and I only spent an hour in the San Francisco airport since it was a stop on a flight. Hopefully I will visit those cities soon
I’ve never been to Seattle either
And p rainy I heard
idk, i've never been to the west coast
> olive oil ice cream souds sus tho
@addat it is good tho
Wtf no
Sigh
Idk I dont like that many wierd foods
But if you do, then rip you you're missing out
I’ve never had squid or duck
And occasionally restaurant employees would be dumb enough to not read my order properly and then leave beef in the food I ordered
And then I accidentally bite into it and die a little inside
Too late I have olive oil sitting in my Midwestern pantry
We were already on the topic of weird food this ain’t entirely my fault
As far away from me as possible
Ah crap it’s midnight sleepy time
oh oof that sucks
Biden should sign an executive order to ban that shit
I ain't finna lie that glitch went hard 😭 😭
You know you can just say "hi, someone wants to have a chat about...." instead of this
Actually I just realized
Not saying that in a bad way
It's there but it hasn't been growing very much
won't shave for a year
Like it doesn't go all the way
i don't want to end up looking like jeff from american dad
i'm not persian sorry
i get a fair amount of facial hair
i think i used the wrong verb
Yea carbs gives u temporary energy, the rest goes to fat
U should control ur carbs and fat at a very specific percentage
Like everything happened in the Middle East lol
he wasn't white thats all i know
They apparently found proof
well i know he wasn't roman, and the romans were the only white guys in the area back then
I can’t remember
The discovery of america by colon happened there too
more fat or more carbs
And fill the rest with carbs and fat
Quick maths
If u r working out
Even if u r not I don't think it hurts eating around 100
There was a study that found that animals that eat more calories die faster cause there's more metabolic pressure if I recall correctly
I don't think it'll kill u
And anything that doesn't kill u
And didn't allow me to follow back
That happens when someone accepts your invite no?
I sold all my valuable stuff
Oh
I dont like notifications from any app
thats so sad but i only wanted to be friends
I dont accept no one i dont know
One wants to go out with u, or one does not
Wow Rober is gonna leave us on requested😔
“… NO I DONT”
It's worse when someone accepts it and doesn't follow back
I unfollow them immediately I ain’t gonna take that crap
Omg chillll
I hate that I have to press two buttons
I haven’t posted in a year
I still don't get as many likes as someone girls posing with their friends
yeah its partially due to the algorithm
I don’t care about likes
YOU AINT AN INFLUENCER
@speedbirdconcorde2 when are you flying me on your plane?
I have insta cause many friends stopped using fb
I never post on fb
I hope they don't all move to tiktok
i only got insta last year cause the indian peeps made a group there
What do u post with a private tho
Though I don’t use it anymore
Damn Moses u r hot
it's stupid
I don’t use mine anymore
That too I don’t post there much
Yea I still don't understand snapchat
It's so hard to use and I don't see a point
Wtf
Damn
damn moses out here making connections
Oh yea some of them left their snap
Damn
not even close
He's attractive tho
You guys have thousands of followers wtf
i don't want to lol
Can u tho, I thought u r 24
Not trying to imply anything, I'm totally into him
I don’t have an insane amount of followers on Twitter
but that;s cause they follow mutuals and i don't
my social media presence is close to none
i either accept or delete mine
I used to do that now I don’t
i only share stuff with my close friends and that's it. don't need to broadcast it to the world
@speedbirdconcorde2 what are you studying?
Go buy diarrhea coin instead
Work at the Federal reserve
Y’all want money? I want a stable mind🥲
really
it really is late stage capitalism huh
not that wednesday tho my parents will be around 👀
Nope :lmfno:
ugh thats on the other side of campus
sad
I will supply myself take or leave
don't do drugs
stay away from it
too late
Fucking Zach also never followed me back
isn't he in this server
yeah lmk when u wanna go
depends on if i have work
Don't spoil it please
48hrs spoilers policy, I can spoil the last episode but there's nothing too shocking
not here you wont
I watched the 1st episode, but some people haven't
I want Disney plus but haven’t talked to my parents about it
You can technically still find the episodes online...
I’m not risking getting a virus on my computer by pirating them
Idk I’ll live
Some Nickelodeon shows like iCarly are on Netflix so I’ll watch them since my parents wouldn’t let me when I was growing up
Oh same but I snuck those episodes in
I can’t say if you’re trolling or that’s actually gonna happen
Ending was kinda upsetting tho
You have to watch Spirited Away if you haven’t already
The ending isn’t out yet
The manga has already ended
I haven’t finished the manga
Apparently
Don't you live in Houston? Why don't you know the weather? 🤔
yeah the AC is turned off so I am suffering right now
Oh yikes
My AC broke in summer 2019 and it was awful so I feel your pain
Your AC isn’t broken it’s only turned off
The AC capacitor is in the middle of being replaced, so I hope that the AC will be turned on by the time I go to bed in the evening 😂
Ugh ping
Holy crap its 9am and I’m awake
I'm waking up at 7 AM everyday which is actually earlier than during the spring semester when I was waking up at 8 AM everyday
Which sucks
I haven't been affected by it, fortunately
Oh lucky duck
Oh wow, I'm surprised you know about that since that was a long time ago
90 is insane still
I went out for a walk today in 95 degree weather and I sweated profusely even though I wasn't walking quickly
I have like no tolerance for hot weather
Non coastal cali has low humidity so the heat isnt as bad as like texas
I just don’t like burning in general
Fair lol
No I don’t
That's one reason why weather in Phoenix or Las Vegas isn't as bad as it first looks based on temperature, humidity in those cities is really low. Houston is high humidity and high temperature
We're near the Gulf Coast
My hair gets SUPERRRRRR HOT when I’m outside in hot weather because of my black hair. I bet you can cook an egg on my head in 95 degree weather outside
I don't know Oyster Creek but I see that it's in Brazoria County and I've been to parks there before
Yeah that’s why I don’t wanna ever live in Arizona or the west coast in general
Maybe Washington or Oregon though idk
Def not cali I don’t like hot climates
sorry I meant Oyster Creek Park
I think we should stop utilizing asphalt for pavement because they get SUPER hot
Oh. I have not been there. I don't spend that much time in Sugar Land.
If you haven’t you should
David will have to make the effort because it's a long drive from his location to mine 💀
I thought you 2 lived close to each other
Nope
Ah rip
Oh geeeeeeeez
I don't know. I think my height might still be increasing very slowly and I'll probably try to lose some weight soon
So specific wtf
Working out
Someone was asking me about my stats to determine how many calories I should have
I really don’t like websites like white pages
Don’t attack my poor humor😭
Because I said food is bad?
Weird =~ bad
Where did you find this?
I WAS LATE
Damn, what are the odds that the second message on that page would be about HTX?
@sprinkles2108 you gotta leave it so at least is readable
Legit I read only the first word wtf
I feel @_frostyyyyy_ is the kinda guy who never goes to parties but when he goes to one...damn, is on
Cause he frost, get it?
I don't know what that is
Yet you don't eat smoked steak, take that liberals
ban adam for trying to murder David
I can’t eat steak for religious purposes lol
oh 5.9
i cant tell how much of a meme the rise and grind stuff is or if david just has a really unhealthy life
American religion is steak tho
Sorry my religion is Hind*i*
idk u said before that u sometimes work like 100 hours a week
fair
so college is sus?
7 AM isn't that early and there's nothing wrong with coffee. I only drink one cup a day anyway
I took a 4-hour nap today and I feel refreshed😎😎
So dumbasses can say they had a lot of alcohol without getting into comma
Idk how but it refuels me
Coffee doesn’t really work unless I’m REALLY tired and am traveling
I don't take naps either
Like even iced coffee warms your stomach
Or on an empty stomach in general
I ran out of milk
Now my protein powder gonna taste like shit
They won't know what this means
@chandachan that's not the whole message, put that he wants a cup for his milk
I need the milk
be careful what you wish for
I had half a scoop with just water
Tho it's a whole different beverage with milk
Wtf
Yes,  you didn’t know?
omg that was Clement
my udders are so sore
Sources say this is exactly what happened
cuz WHO didn't approve it yet right? at least that's what i heard last
which is stupid
Leaving on the 14th
Vaccines aren't required so why would it matter?
not really
i think you're tired so gn raunak
idk about case but mayhaps
oh
like 30 mins back
i don't think we need to socially distance
you don't
Do people who are vaccinated need to wear masks indoors?
idk how to change it
oh whale
im on my laptop
i did change my laptop settings to dark mode
but ig chrome didn't follow through
chrome sucks
@_frostyyyyy_  imma hug you
outside there's no need
we don;t have to wear them inside our suites tho
Who's going to spend any time in their suite except to sleep though?
kinda sad that we have to wear masks ngl
In your car?
It's bizarre since COVID restrictions are being dropped in most places right now or have already been. These rules are extremely cautious
we dropped restrictions in this country way too early imo
we won't lol
they won't even consider it before then
They won't lol, they set an impossible goal
If half the tuition is not a good enough incentive idk what is
tbh at this point those who haven't uploaded are either a) forgetting to b) not vaccinated by choice or c) cannot get the vaccine at all for many reasons
yea the one i took doesnt count
sorry we have a sketchy history with trusting the brits
Nah not really, because those areas are red and nobody wants to get the vaccine
indians don't eat crumpets
masala chai tho 😋
I don't trust anyone who spells "yogurt" as "yoghurt"
it is yoghurt tho
sorry but us americans are poor and can't afford to type the letter "u"
grey is stupid
If I put "grey" spellcheck marks it wrong so
GASP THE BRITS HAVE HACCED MY LAPTOP
cuz some still dont get it
jk ily america don't suspend my citizenship
but can i get my citizenship taken away? i was literally born here
what will i be if they take away my citizenship
Yea they cut off the -American
i still have my OCI oh lala
Also, is cwru’s vpn usually bad?
And these aren’t YouTube videos
Better than me, I'm doing nothing this summer 🤡
Aren't you taking a class right now?
Oh
Nothing wrong with that, it might be important
You have to learn before you can really start doing the research. Obviously you can't just get right to it
Oh trust me I’m still a little lost as to what exactly her thesis is about
The same will probably not be said about PHYS122 tho
I’m copying a video file onto my actual laptop to see if the buffering is just a VPN issue🤡
@nobelium19 anything from the speed test yet?
Dang it I’m gonna have to copy all the files to my actual laptop now smh
The speed test, no significant difference in download speed, upload speed is reduced by half for me tho
That's just for my wifi tho
@nobelium19 yep, the VPN was the issue because now my copied video is no longer buffering
VPN stands for "Very Poor Network"
oh yee
So I copied a video to my actual laptop and disconnected the VPN
And the buffering is gone
With my VPN it was really glitchy
how tf did you connect to their servers without being on the case network?
oh im prolly just dumb
no but like if it's stored on your computer now, then you downloaded it
Is that supposed to be a joke lol
very serious
@sprinkles2108 Have you tried shutting down your computer and turning on it again?
If so, try shutting down your internet and turning that on again
If that doesn't work, try buying a new computer, new internet, new router, or a new house
I like that last option
I don’t feel like doing the others
They seem like too much work
I think that you should stop using computers and study something else
That should work
Cuz spacing is a little hard when ur plane is hella fast, and bribed ur government to give priority
No, weight doesn't concern air traffic controls
Tho most of the time they r correlated
Cuz of, hm, hot rod addiction
So do you own the plane?
Bruh a car is already expensive 😢
And if u want anything newer than 2000, it will be in the 200k-1 million range
I’m still processing the chances of that happening
wtf
sick shit
He never takes his nice Cello with him for these tho😫
@speedbirdconcorde2 I need a private plane ride sometime
Or what kinda plane u wanna charter
How much is the typical cost for a short flight
Where u wan go
death
Wtf
> “It doesn’t take much time to get a full thickness or third degree burn when exposed to hot pavement,” Foster said in a press briefing last week. “Because if you look at hot pavement or asphalt at two o’clock in the afternoon in direct sunlight, the temperature is usually somewhere around 170 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.”
why is this kinda scary o.o
And I don’t…?
Fair
Nope
wtf even is this account
Me to my videos that saved to the cloud instead of my local drive: WHAT WAS THE REASON. WHAT WAS THE REASONNNNNNNN
The pain 😔
Unless ur editing or have bad access then <<<the cloud
Yeah ik my life is so hard I might as well cry
Damn talk about 16k videos
Idk
If that doesn’t work reduce quality and try downloading again
I think most of them are almost there though
Your hard drive will hate you
Because I don’t need to store them
Still a major :thonk: moment but ok
And I won’t care😀👍
AstraZeneca isn't approved? 😬
apparently only CDC approved vaccines count rn
yeah looks like they didn't expand to WHO approved vaccines. just CDC
they probably will expand tho
So CWRU is rejecting a lot of vaccines that many international students get and then complaining that people aren't vaccinated 😐
lol they don't have to
they should tho
i dont think america supplied their vaccines to the world
some intls got the vaccine here tho
"do you want a revolutionary war 2.0 in my body??????"
Clement doesn't have an instagram so I provided Finn's handle
Fuck
Wtf
well idk how to feel about forcing students to get another vaccine when there's already one kind in their bodies lol
already took a vaccine 😌
My hiccups right now are so bad
is that a surprise tho
idk sachit
i could've done some actual lab work but my grad student i can stay at home and still research too
Airplane days are gone ig
oh ty
i didn't have an airplane as a pfp lol
It's so annoying. 2 times, I heard the siren and ambulance sound during my exam
My food tolerance has gone so low. After not eating much this week due to a delivery fk up, having a chipotle meal makes me nauseous.
Just wanted to send this for those taking Ochem soon. That's what the med-student has to say about it
Also that med student is wrong. He will certainly utilize ochem when he’s a doctor
As a doc, you don't do mechanisms
I was seeing Bollywood drama and Bollywood witty comments till the day of the exam. No cap
You don’t use calculus in comp sci⁉️⁉️
Mb. It's hard to distinguish sarcasm with reality at times
Rippppp I didn’t get a tornado warning
Last time I went to my basement because of a tornado warning was 2 summers ago
I assumed since I'm about an hour and a half away from you you were under a watch as well
I’m kidding don’t watch that
Yh. Unfortunately, I saw it before
It looks like there’s a yellow filter on the air outside
I actually don’t experience many of the Indian stereotypes
When is it that is the last day that we can arrive to campus?
I think August 24 is the last day since August 25 is the 'Official "No-Show" Date'
You won't want to get here that late anyway since classes will have begun by then
Isn’t that the first day of school?
oh theres only one consul
And let them know you’re probably gonna be late so that they don’t take your room away
are there zoom classes anymore?
If I don't need to show up every day for lecture then I got more time for driving doordash LMAO
Probably not. Only for those internationals who can’t make it on campus will probably have Zoom lectures
Yeah, I think there's just a maximum late date you can arrive, after that they take your room
My semiconductors class this spring had an in person and remote option, and the prof used both zoom recordings and echo360 mediavision to record lectures
Nice. Yh, that's also an efficient method. It's hard to maintain that much pressure tho so CO2 stays as a liquid and a gas
Chemical solvents may still remain in the caffeine and beans/leaves even after being filtered out, whereas the CO2 just evaporates, so it's a lot safer for health too
I didn’t read the textbook 😅 but I remember we learned De Broglie wavelength and the photoelectric effect. There was more but I can’t remember the material 2 years back, I just remember it was convenient not having to learn some of the material for the ENGR145 exam.
that's some sick shit
Those are general principles for testing shit tho
Even tho he was in a chamber with 3 soundproof layers and wore hearing protection his ears were ringing after the fracture
A military base many miles away thought a bomb went off
For seeing bone density. After the surgeries etc. and inserting electrode, we need to conduct that test in the mechanics lab.
Ah that's the toxic shit that was used to make decaf coffee beans long ago
A slightly acidic pH would be optimum (4-6) because dichloromethane protonates caffeine making it acidic so the yield of caffeine would increase the more acidic conditions are.
I don't know if this makes sense.
That's for my Ochem 1 Lab. The DLR is due at 5 and I just started today lol
Once you get to strength of materials in ENGR 200 U will learn how I beams work and how to fw them
Las Vegas banning "useless grass"? What about banning Las Vegas, its location is so bad for a city
Writing a form with a friend who did it last year
without it you will be turned away before you're even allowed into the embassy
Right but for that we have to ask our uni isn't it
Doesn't it?
you don't pay for the i-20
This was a biggg pain
I spent the whole day doing that
The only thing I dont is the sevis payment confirmation
Cause the uni took that from my balance account last year
So I didn't pay it myself
i've been waiting for over half my life
did you pay it yet?
i'm assuming you didn't because you didn't receive your i-20 yet?
Case did last year, they took the money from my student balance
you spent year 1 in colombia?
No, they took the money from my balance account
shouldn't the embassy just know if you paid
Same, like as far as I know I need to have sevis before I get the I 20 so if I already have the I 20 that implies I already paid the sevis
no? don't you pay the sevis _after_ you get the i-20?
The sevis fee is for unis to put me on a student database isn't it
Nope, not last year, the sevis fee got deducted from my student balance and then I got the I 20
Which explains how nuclear reactions work
I forgot all of them as soon as I turned the final in
@speedbirdconcorde2 Guess my strats for learning are better at putting shit in long term memory
Imagine if you couldn't forget anything you remembered, the world would honestly be a worse place
I'm trying to get over my fear of horror movies 😦
My older brother is trying to get me to watch them though lol
That movie scared me lol
I don’t normally watch horror movies but I don’t think I mind them
I’m 19 and still live with my parents🥰
I have a house with my brother, but just on the paper cause he pays all of it
Wait you’ve co-signed but you still didn’t pay…? Or did you mean your name isn’t on the papers
I don't get scared of horror movies when I watch them, I get scared after I watch them
Well I get a little scared during the actual movie, but I get more scared after
i get scared for the next 2-3 days and then im fine
Oh for me it's a longer time
I watched Saw on Halloween with some dorm friends and I was scared for a good couple weeks
Contrary to school days I have been trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule and I'm probably going to take my quiz first thing in the morning tomorrow so
Are you taking a summer class?
The good thing about university is that there are still good and bad professors, but all of them at least know what they're talking about
Hopefully, it won't be like this year, where a few of my teachers used COVID as an excuse to not teach us
Sorry mate
At least for bio, I get a lot more out of studying on my own than I do from lectures
Bio lectures are useless except some of them ig
Guaifenesin (I've never heard of this before and need to extract this in my next lab lol)
I'm curious how. I'm assuming that a 19 year old doesn't have a ton of cash to buy a home with and that a bank won't give a 19 year old a mortgage
How are they going to pay off the loan without a full-time job?
If the 19 year old has some stable work or job, then he could pay if off slowly
Most 19 year-olds don’t have well-paying full-time jobs here
I don’t even have $15k in my bank account😭😭😭
i don't even have a bank account
Don’t you have a credit card
I should probably get a credit card👀
i'm getting debit card
cause credit card isn't allowed for students or something
But it’s easier to dispute fraudulent activity on credit card rather than debit
I should really get a credit card
I don’t make online purchases for this reason
U don't make online purchases?
Because I can’t easily dispute any case where my debit card is hacked
I don’t really shop online
I recommend PNC since its ATM‘s are on campus
Stores rip u off like hell tho
Keybank is the literal worst
They suck
WELLLS FARRRGGOOOOOOOOO oh lord i remember their terrible overcharging scandal
i hate using cash. i plan on using card as much as possible
Chase is close though
It's still one of the biggest banks in the US
When I was getting my debit card last year the bank teller told us that PNC is partnered with Case
So you can withdraw cash without walking far
I don’t know anything else
Don't know much about Chase
I think my dad had chase gold or smth before but maybe we stopped using it
I hate the days we had to go to the locker and sit in BoFa for hours. That was the start of patience
Then after waiting for 3 hours for lungar or roti subzi I lost my faith in guru ji
> I lost my faith in guru ji
IM DYING 😂
Oh
so the case id would only work as a atm card and not an actual debit card
At least I don’t think
Aka ugly as heck as well as a horrible bank
I’ve never seen a key bank card
that would work
i don't want yall to rob him before i do
You can't do anything with just CVV I think
yea you can't
ngl the card looks ugly
I put all of mine in an RFID sleeve anyways so doesn't matter
Raunak it’s literally so convenient you don’t even know
Except at boomer places where the pin pads don’t support Apple Pay🙄
Unless India has Costco and I don’t even know about it?
My dad already had
Your dad lives in India and has been paying Costco’s membership fee for this long?
So my dad kicked off my mom on the add on acting like he didn't know her and added me coz it's more useful for me lol
Damn lol
After that, I didn't find anyone to go with or just got lazy
Yeah it’s hard to go to Costco regularly
I used to be team Sam’s Club (similar store like Costco) but then we went back to Costco because it’s closer to us🥲
I miss Sam’s Club. Their quality is better than Costco from what I remember
If someone has a car, we can go to Costco
I get severe back pain there tho
In a car?
Leaving 20th evening
Oh gotcha
Haven't planned for spring. Heck, I don't even know where I'll store my stuff for this summer in CWRU
oh
i'm leaving 15th dec
@raunakwastaken ansh is saying he’s leaving india
im just saying when im leaving CLE
“I’m leaving on the 20th” “December?” Which implies you’re asking if he’s leaving December 20th
Why would he say he’s leaving on the 20th immediately after saying he’s arriving on the 21st and refer to leaving cle and not India
damn i got schooled for misinterpreting a text 😩
I just want more than 1 vegetarian option
That would be my guess in addition to tofu
For a few months and then right back to normal
I don’t think I’ve ever had a borgar
oh they have that but it'd
*sigh*
u will not die i promise :8ACOSP_thumbsup:
Idk
It was difficult to find since the room is carpeted
Chicks be wearing masks to prevent bird flu
Someone put that mask there
Easier to clean up anyway
Just throw the mask away
Scientists don’t exactly know but they think our body just sends the microplastics through the digestive system *or* they penetrate through our membranes and enter our bloodstream😃
Omg check her stories I’m dying
Could really use $600 to fund my college education yknow
25 mins back
oh?
I didn’t see
I don’t have a dm from her
how do u find requests :PES_Clown:
She didn’t dm me🥲🥲🥲
^it would appear like that if you I don’t accept
i don't have an requests :wobble:
I could have also cropped instead of colouring the whole screen 🤡
it can all happen through you
which one's harder: math 121 or 125
I mean, it's fair, I just don't wanna come back with a single kidney
oh this bitch followed me too
Its rhe school admin seekng who they can take fin aid away from cuz they got an outside scholarship
and lives 3 minutes away from me
not even close
don't jinx it
holy shit
long ago a tornado destroyed part of the elementary school i went to
my school is on flat land
the land where the home depot and target is used to be a racetrack for horse racing
damn
@sprinkles2108 shortly after we moved into this house, i had a dream where i was walking past a farmland, and my dad had died, but in the next part of the dream I was in the town square with brick buildings and a flowing fountain
turns out the previous owner sold the house cuz her dad died, and that this area did used to be a huge farmland
@_frostyyyyy_ we're bringing back the hugs
They're a lot more conservative than American shows tho so
I don’t know
arabic shows can go either way
i heard he was in home alone 2
They recently cut him off 😂😂
Oh it was on my phone
I can still type in French with my English keyboard though
Took it for 4 years in middle/high school
So if I wanted to type a foreign word then it's ok on phone
Whereas on pc i need to fuck with unicode LMAO
even tho theres language settings for the special chars
@_frostyyyyy_ don't software ppl do that all the time to code shit faster
back in the day they had to use reference books instead of the internet
That’s fair
why haven't you been banned
@everyjuan how to mute someone?
guess what my result was
wrong answers only
lol books have been around far longer before code
Gutenberg invented his printing press far before Ada Lovelace developed her theoretical computer
Computer vision seems to be a really neat field but I can't claim to know that much yet since it's usually an advanced undergraduate/graduate level topic. I have also enjoyed learning about algorithms and I'm looking forward to taking Algorithms in the fall
Algorithms, Logic Design and Computer Organization, Database Systems, Operating Systems, The Role of Social Media in Politics
damn that's a lot of CS
That’s even worse, if it gets too theroretical you will turn into a cs prof
Daily reminder that I’ve never seen a normal cs prof
too late for that
being normal is boring
fuck that
no, this is weird in a bad way
OH
what exactly happened?
idk. And yeah reges now teaches intro to cs at my state school
all the APCS kids are forced to suck up to him in seattle
richard stallman is probably the worst
most of them seem to be extremely nerdy and kind of quirky. Nothing like a cs prof
a few from my state school, a few from the internet, ~~plus i have connections~~
once my dad got into an argument with stallman back in the 80's
it was really bad, my dad had tendonitis and had to use speech to text for coding since he could not type. He asked stallman to make speech to text more compatible with some of his projects, and stallman told him to fuck off because speech to text software was proprietary
yeah, he's done sketchier shit since then too
Not yet but I likely will
Yeah im still debating it
I really should get the student plan though
iOS doesn't have YouTube Vanced
Oh wowwwww
It is a thing but since Vanced results in less money for Google, you have to download it from the Vanced website since it's not on the Play Store
youtube was somehow taking up a lot of space on my phone
What language are you trying to learn on there?
You can do it from safari tho
Safari doesn't block ads
Well yea but you can turn off your phone and still watch the video/music
Not completely turned off
And they would be saved to my camera roll
Modern problems require modern solutions
Unfortunately yes :(
What Ad blockers could I use though?
They're very effective, I literally never see ads while browsing on my desktop or laptop
It isn't sandboxed
So far I've personally seen two cases of adware infecting all browsers on macs through Safari in a year and a half
Return to Firefox? Fam imma go back to internet explorer
Ew no not that far back
Less ram and cpu usage tho…
My computer does heat up occasionally
Clearly you haven’t run android studio
Shit gets hot and loud
Oh
They’re adding furniture back to tink
Never realized it was that empty
I would say it's better if it doesn't have too much, cause student groups need plenty of space for projects
Why couches in think you go there to work
Cuz couches are comfy
I personally cannot work when sitting on a couch
You're fked after that. I couldn't finish that waffle. God,  my stomach is screwed
That too when it's raining
i just realized that and now i have so many questions
oh y'all havent been to eurowaffel
no cuz im normal
It's pretty good but stomach hurts after that if you have alone
even if you dont like it
i've been there but it took me a hot minute to get it :LAUGHING:
sorry but i canceled eurowaffle
I couldn't say the name lol. I can't say "Can I have an Orgasm to a female"
priyanka ur missing out
I was like the one that can't be said
on eating at a restaurant that names a waffle orgasm? yeah im certainly not missing out on anything there
is it tho
i think i tried that napoleon one
You can hear the rain also right
oh if im overstressed i don't eat
That's on the day of exams
Before that or when I feel like it, I overeat
I'm definitely taking suite mates there tho.
Damn hectic
Ochem Labs are done tho
3 experiments due each week is not too bad 😂
this is why i didn't take summer classes
because im actually pretty slow
Final exam is on Wednesday for OChem plus packing/Covid test etc so kinda stressed but it's fine
I still manage to procrastinate even in summer classes lol
damn
Don't do it in the summer bro
oh shit
You need more practice other than 1 day for mechanisms imo
That feeling I mean
Ochem with lab in a month is kinda brutal imo. Our teacher even says so
Is that part of their secret menu? Doesn't seem to be part of the official menu
Every good student before living alone
Where's the meme of sonic when I need it
mad respect for writing them on paper, my friend and i had templates for hexagons and pentagons that we used on our ipads lmfao
I haven't even used a single model kit
Which EE/CS classes have SI sessions? Didn't know data structures did but its a core intro course which makes sense
i might be wrong tho
Sick
math 121/122 did not have SI sessions
still SI's so
so we didn't have SI sessions
oh bruh how
really weird
especially for a highly populated math sequence
nope. they had their individual office hours (like TAs) tho
like i get it if math 223 was like this
but math 121/122?
are we still talking about math
you still messed up your ninja edit
@bravo5127 damn
Yeah. I've only been SI for 4 semesters but in my experience the 2 falls semesters have been very rewarding and the 2 spring semesters haven't.
4 sems damn
holy shit
But yeah, when COVID happened, last spring semester, most of my session were just me and one other regular, and she told me this semester that she's using MATLAB for her project and that was super duper rewarding. Nobody else really showed up. Some people did, but then stopped. Flashback to my first fall semester, I had many people show up, made quite a few friends, and we had a lot of fun. The students cheered for me the last lecture and said I needed a raise.
still wanna challenge michael to a game?
#self-promos michael omg 🙄
@bravo5127 i might be an elite poker player and am just bluffing that i don;t know poker
cuz he apparently is a pro
he doesn't mind putting in every rupee he's got
yea i don't
Data Structures is literally the only EECS class that has SI sessions lol. SI sessions seem to be more common for premed classes than engineering classes
@_frostyyyyy_ did he get a degree in math?
Real analysis is strongly recommended for many economics PhD programs now and the more math, the better. I'm looking at the American Economic Association website and they recommend calculus, linear algebra, statistics, differential equations, probability, methods of proof, stochastic processes, and real analysis
Over the last 50 years it's become very mathematical
@sprinkles2108 Did you install an ad blocker? Is it working well?
Havent had the chance to do that yet. I might install it tomorrow
I got halfway through brushing my teeth before I realized what I was doing
Well today your teeth will be extra clean!
@Deleted User Bro, wtf is this. 72 times doing starbursts for 4 compunds and 18 different reagents
It's part of the HW. 7,8, and 9 are due tomorrow
HAHAHHAA we had one per SI session, now you feel our pain
they help a lot imo tho
So I don't really like that but maybe it'll help now
yeah I feel the same way
Chapter 11 has a crap ton of mechanisms. I haven't even started that
holy, we didn't even get past ch9
And those retro-synthesis problems
hopefully dr shri gives you an easy one on the upcoming exams tho
She could literally ask anything. Everyone was lost in her classes
i don't blame them, they literally throw around 60+ mechanisms at you in like 3 class periods
NOT DISCUSSED IN CLASS WTF
So you're expected to know two chapters that aren't covered in class?
Isn't that like 20 percent of the material?
Plus I have to find where to store two boxes of mine before flight and take an RT PCR test in rite aid the day before flight
Just need one more
ateveryone i hath worked 27.5 hours so far
Hmm maybe you should’ve taken bio instead
I don’t know though
Bio is too much content. I'm not able to procrastinate as well as I do during a normal semester
Not that bad. It's just this week probably
And my exam is a 4 hour timed take home now
Slightly less stressed from being suffocated yesterday but still
LOL WTF
RIP
I didn’t tell her that my power went out but I did tell her earlier that when I get home from work I’ll try to work on stuff from another computer
And then the power went out when I got home🤡
That's just a giant RIP
damn
I do be sleepy doe
series circuits are the shit
I’m just too sleepy to work now
Don't you mean @zacharious seeing all these pings 😌
u missed @quintus_fabius_
I'll look into getting the bot running again, I don't know how to do timed intervals but I'll see if I can't get it working for @zacharious
but for some reason it doesn't work if you try it with hours or something
Oh yeah that would work
It'd be a little inefficient if I have it running in a loop tho
you don't need any sleep stuff
Oh actuallyb
I have a first-gen Ryzen CPU from 4 years ago and Microsoft says that I don't meet minimum requirements for Windows 11
When your teacher wants you to write something in Arial font 🤮
really hoping the "minimum requirements" are more like "suggested requirements"
ň̵͝ő̸̊p̶̓͗e̷̊͝
macos catalina also messed up big time, cause now it doesn't support 32bits, so a bunch of apps and software that allowed windows stuff on Mac are not working anymore
Also because more complicated with permissions and bootcamp doesn't support anything but windows 10 😤
whatever you do, don't look up the Chinese character for month
I'm bored, studying is not helping
What are you studying? Physics?
i still haven't started
If I don't get A in Ochem, it's coz there was a fucking lawnmower dude outside and the sound was so loud for like half the duration of my exam
Imagine taking a final Ochem exam whose content is based on what you learnt the past week only (5 chapters) and there's this asshole of a lawnmower pissing the living shit out of you
I had to take two semesters and jterm in a latino neighborhood with music all days and parties every weekend, people who lost jobs cause pandemic just stayed home partying and kids wouldn't go to school so they be screaming around
Can’t find the concentration of SiO_2 in an aqueous solution given a volume fraction without concentrating
There's always construction/demolition in my area but it's not too bad. Sometimes people in my Zoom calls note that it's loud though
I used xm4's but could still hear the lawnmower sound
I took ENGR145 instead  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Do you like the XM4? I was looking into noise-cancelling headphones since I like headphones and I don't have noise-cancelling headphones yet but they're pricey even when on sale
I wouldn't even use noise-cancelling headphones that much so I'm very reluctant to make them my most expensive pair
I used 5 dollar Panasonic headphones for a while and they're really cheap but sound horrible
rip
I don't have any NC gear
Now, I'm scared for my packing
Need to do RT-PCR also. The time crunch never stops
Alone
About the lawn mower thing, I didn't close my windows. So dumb
I also have Beats headphones but my dad broke them somehow smh
Was it over Zoom? If so, you should have messaged the professor and told her "I'm going to close the windows really quickly"
Open book take home. 4 hours long exam
Still difficult tho
I should've closed the windows when I had the time but I still completed all Q's irrespective of difficulty
Anyways, my focus is on packing now
Have any of you taken an RT-PCR test
No, why do you need to take it?
My flight is Tom. Lot to do still 😭
ive got cloud alphas for my pc and they're lit af
Airport has its own charm bro
Some habits don't get old. Cheez its still excite me
Oh u r the one who took all the tickets
O.o
I’m in the car with fam
I'm still near case
I'm scared of driving
This comes from a person who can pilot a plane effortlessly...
Much less chance in accidentally killing someone when my adhd kicks in
Tho don't tell the FAA I said that, they gon cancel my medical
There's something called "find something to do"
does sending this in a dead chat somehow bother u :pikathink:
U didn't tag me, I wasn't around
sorry :xCrittyx:
not only that but there was a ROACH in the hospital .
this hospital is in NY, so no
holy fuck LMAO
yeah this hospital is in nyc 💀
since when do we have a ross emote :0
you saw nothing
i just find it weird that y'all have all these plans on where you want to go specifically
Bruh me??? Having plans??????
Adam you do realize I’m not guaranteed admission into medical school
you completed 25% of undergrad and are already saying this... you have plans
i don't even know if i want to go to med school
I'm hurt by this assessment of our relationship
I mean am I wrong though
I haven’t met you irl yet lol
idk the difference between manifesting plans and just planning but ok
Fair
My plans were to drop out of college at first year and become a billionaire
I wanted to be a lawyer for a while, and then realized I would be unhappy in that profession
Didn’t really work out
But didn’t work out
I ain’t wifey material 😔
aw fuck i had the wrong thing on my clipboard
actually i didn't get facebook until i was in 11th grade
never understood the appeal
I didn’t get fb until the end of hs
~~Maybe I should go back to work~~
I still don’t use fb that much except for my club exec gc
Dem FarmVille posts though🥰
@addat wanna come kill it
i’m bored
I'm staying the fuck away from NY
I promised myself I'd go back to documentation tho so...
I’m now accepting early applications for sugar babies
Serious inquiries only
you should go to law school, not med school
So I naturally woke up early
i've been sleeping ok
*but my body today decided to get up after 4 hours of sleep*
How dare your body wake you up after only r hours of sleep
I napped twice in one day for the last few days
Well rested? Never
i wanna sleep 12 hours
I wanna sleep for like 8 hours and not feel tired
I had a good sleep today but am still feeling sleepy cause eyes are tired from all the pressure
mm i'm starting to feel tired aagain
Oh
That made you sleepy?
Some of us though
I have work in 3 hours I cri
until i lose it, imma show off my privilege
they'll prolly fall of tho
can't hold their boots and gear
who told u i'm in cleveland tho
let alone case
let alone stj
i'm dad
You referred to someone as they
i'm dad
Wrong
Why did you leave me
kids without marriage? that is haram
I feel like lighting the bacteria in my throat on fire
ah shit that went wrong
stupid translate
oml google translate is killing my grammar
grammar is kinda ouch tho
cuz literal translation
I wish I could go back to sleep
Sigh
bro google translate can't translate to hebrew 😭
how is that a dare tho
oh ic :0
where do you work?
I'M SO JEALOUS OF EVERYONE THEY'RE ASLEEP
oh
*priyanka goes on to slit everyone's throat*
You’re just slow
Well at least we can’t delete our words irl next month
priyanka doesn't know how hard it is for us raunak :wobble:
oh damn
what is hard for us
What’s hard
english is hard for us?
oh
i didn't see
idk
Damn first a haircut
So that I can’t recognize him this fall
The exclamation point gave it away
this is exactly why we need the weird champ emote
i miss that emote
sigh
don;t make me miss that emote more
I don’t think raunak was being dirty minded at all with that
i can vc now if you want
why not just text
i can't vc now :wobble:
huh no i woke up over 2 hours ago
Texting is so much work
yet we still use discod
Ahahahaha just realized I made a physics pun teehee
*work*
Ironic isn’t it
oh
Couldn’t be me
rip my golden hours
now i don;t have to talk to yall :)
my mind at ease
from dis pain
The pain of thinking about meeting raunak
I kind of promised some peeps I would code some stuff for their game and forgot about it
So I cant
Gotta be an early riser
My throat would beg to differ
priyanka did you know raunak doesnt like srk
ive never wathced that movue
Idk
most of these actors are shit
Like oop srk married someone he liked and pissed off his egoistic father
Momma was sad
the big shit
Karan Johar sucks. I mean that London meeting scene was so overdramatic. I got so bored so I just 1.5 x that part
@chandachan Bro wtf is this
I didn’t like main hoon na that much😭
Same thing happened in kuch kuch hota hai
Idk I just wasn’t digging the military plot
I haven’t really watch houseful
Also yeah but he keeps getting cast in roles he obviously is too old for😭
Guzaarish is sad. The paralyzed one right
It really applies😂
I watched it a few months ago and it hit so hard
Karan johar is that Indian aunty at weddings who keeps saying she was the shit back then but everyone knows she lying
Nepotism is still rampant!
Yesterday, I was watching a hindi movie about a guy proving himself alive since he's declared dead on government documents. Such unique ideas - Kaagaz
So I can’t rec him shit😭
I don’t think you spelt this right
I can’t find it
I was in the middle of watching main hoon na before I fell asleep
Lately i was occupied with Wimbledon
Don’t tell him
I don’t need him slandering someone else I love😭
Someone else?
Except hanks newest
I need that
US Netflix doesn’t have many Indian movies sigh
It's not so bad also. It went over 400cr in box office
I don’t know many Hollywood movies in general so I can’t ask you lol
I’ve never heard of those😳
The big sick?
I saw Gone girl, her, big sick. Don't recall punch drunk love
Then i can’t watch them lol
Don’t mention actors I hardly know any
Look it up damn😭
idk how to describe without spoiling
This dude who wants to have a job
To get what he needs to get done
Omg
^ I got ghosted real hard here
oH
Tenet is really confusing
It really is
yeah sorry my dad made me watch it with him
They aren’t releasing it in India 🥲
it would have been better if we didn’t already know what happens in endgame
She gonna die lmao
But they wanted the movie to lead into another TV show 😩
Really?
I don’t want to reveal too much, but I think that’s the reason they avoided an origin story
If it’s another Loki I will be disappointed
At this point, if it’s not going to be a good movie, I’ll be extremely disappointed
How is WandaVision? I haven't seen it yet
Let me delete some of my messages, since I just realized I may have said some spoilers
@sprinkles2108 How's the research going? I was jet lagged and had a meeting at 12:30 am so couldn't attend it lol. Do you find that the seniors are a bit slow to respond? I emailed many people about the MRI training, research updates, and Nicole Pritts for UH id but no response in 3/4 days
Maybe that's why I didn't understand those spoilers. Thanks for removing it tho.
Sorry, I should have been a little bit more careful...
To be fair, I didn’t watch Avengers Endgame until a year after it came out, so I understand
oh boy this just reminded of my hate for my hs comp sci teacher
I thought you were already in a lab
So I'm trying to binge watch the pre-med linkedin learning stuff till then. Still have 5 courses left
Lol I haven’t worked on that since January💀💀💀
I still have some more modules to go too
Most of them don't even have quizzes. You just have to watch 30 mins videos to see how immature you still are
Nvm. The ones I have left have quizzes and are 1 hour long each. @nobelium19 How did you manage to complete all the modules?
He grinds as hard as david
If I manage to work as hard as David, I'll survive uni.
I was surprised that you finished the season so quickly, but I forgot the run time was like 5.5 hours, so it’s definitely manageable
Can’t tell what is worse, UH mixing up kidneys or the UH helicopter crash

https://www.record-courier.com/article/20020118/NEWS/301189995
Helicopter crash is worse
what's bad is bad
all bad
bad = bad
@ansh8867 well I'm thankful that didn't happen to uh?
people do surgeries on the wrong side of the patient all the time too
Yepppp. I actually did a project on this in high school. The stats are so scary
holy fuck
I did research at cleveland clinic 2 summers ago, and they had me go down to a station to get my picture taken for the badge. I figure it's much quicker in person than remotely cuz it's official
What happens after 48 hours of the email? I'm kinda concerned now
When I come back, it will be there tho right. That was the only concern
Does anyone know what time of day it is okay for us to arrive? What I'm asking is when Wade is open so that I can get my room key and start moving in
I mean it's open till 9 pm. Students need to sleep after all but there are morning and evening shifts so you can expect someone to be there from morning till then
It’s not there anymore. I just marked it as done
You can email him letting him know it's no longer available
Does anyone know if I can order stuff online and have it delivered to CWRU and they keep it for a couple days before I arrive? I don't want to have to buy things like bedsheets and carry it with me on an airplane when I won't need it until I'm on campus
I tried calling them about it but they were busy for a long time 💀
@_frostyyyyy_ Shit gets picked up on campus at Wade I think
I want to get a more definite answer from them but they're not answering their calls
and they don't have an email address
Wade will hold packages for near infinity
I guess I need to upload a new immunization record but there's nothing new so I guess I just upload the same one as before
can't remember
Okay I missed something important, there's a "Upload Immunization Documentation Here" so I'll do that now
i uploaded my document about a month ago and it's still pending review
I'm so late
sigh
Do you need to manually enter in the dates for the individual vaccines or will the CWRU staff validate based on the immunization record?
oh
OH
There's something at the top of the page for me that says I need to update each vaccine AND upload the immunization record
It'll say that even if you uploaded it if they haven't approved it yet
i forgot that
For example, I wonder if I need to type in the dates of my measles vaccines even if I upload the record of all the vaccines
I don't remember doing that last year tho
i would say we should just upload one document but every doctor's office is different
I also have a "Minor Medical Release" form I need to upload but I'm not a minor
most cwru students aren't minors 😭
I haven't heard of that name since 2016
Oh isnt that the former govenor of ohio?
I don't know why we have to do this minor medical release stuff when we aren't minors. Is it an error?
Back to school forms are a pain
Oh yeah I bought my bedsheets and comforter last Friday
I'm planning to ship all of the new stuff I'm buying straight to campus instead of buying it in Houston and flying with it since I can't take that much stuff with me on the airplane
That makes sense. I’m buying all my stuff either from my local stores or online and will drive up with them
I'd like to save money wherever I can though
Money saved is money earned
Money saved is more than money earned because it's not counted under payroll and income taxes
Don't plan to save even if ur well planned
It's important to save some money
I mean it makes sense. My flight ticket alone costed about 3k
Even with the massive increase in transportation costs, the flight + Uber will cost around 250 dollars for me
That’s not bad
@_frostyyyyy_ Which flight are you on for HOU to CLE
At the airport
I've flown internationally before and it's really expensive
Why do you want to know? To see if we're on the same flight?
No, because airline prices have increased so much compared to last summer
Zhanda wants to give David a hug
I'm flying with Delta. I normally fly with Southwest but Southwest is cancelling a LOT of flights lately and Delta isn't and Delta had good prices
American is canceling a lot of flights lately though which scared me off
Damn, that's pretty early
Why so early?
First get a car
Oh gosh my flight straight to CLE was cancelled and changed to one with a layover
Oh yikes
I found Zach’s Reddit the other day on r/cwru💀 dw I didn’t stalk though
There's been a new developement ever since I've come home
How will you know when I reach tho
Who else needs a ride I have 6 more seats available
I don’t even know the landing date 😭
I don't think anyone would come
I don’t have a car sorry. Ask @sprinkles2108
Air india had barely any space. I hate air india
I heard air India is bad
Ofc I don’t remember much
Oh I've been in Utah for the past week and the air is yikes bc of all the fires in oregon and washington
Best for domestic is like indigo etc. but only air india has availability due to like Covid
I haven’t flown in over a year
Raunak, please fill your Air Suvidha form
Wtf is that
I flew for the first time in forever last week. It wasnt that different. Just like ya know huge penalties if you dont have a mask
It's these annoying 5 page form you need to fill as a req with RT-PCR etc
Raunak finna get sent to immigration as soon as he lands because he’s missing that one form
Shit
I wasn't allowed to check-in only so I had to fill that out
I will be killed on the plane fr
Newark airport is crowded af
Although traffic has improved from what I heard LOLLLL
Most people are scared of their lives now
Ayyyy so did my parents when they went to India
Wait for IT sector to open on Sept. Traffic will be shit then
All I remember is that New Delhi’s traffic was a shitshow in 2012. People simply didn’t know how to drive in a straight line
Everyone feels empowered when they do so
I feel superior to them LMAOOOOOOO
Like hahahahaha you slow driver imma pass you
I miss honking but I don't hear the traffic anymore
Honking is annoying
Oh
It literally came 1 day before my arrival. I guess I'm enjoying leisure I won't get on campus rn
I've already faced it once
Going on downtown or University circle itself is surreal. Just don't go after 7:30 pm unless you have a car and are in a group
I was originally thinking on arriving on campus at 1 AM to save money but then I realized that would probably be a bad idea
Yeah, I realized that the increased risk of robbery or carjacking was definitely not worth it and it would have disrupted my sleep schedule since I wouldn't be ready to sleep until 2-3 AM
Priyanka, please get your car to campus
@sprinkles2108 pick Ansh up at the airport on the 21st at 9:30am
The meal plan doesn't work until 4:30 PM Aug 21
I went at 8:02 and it was closed
Also, sun doesn't set till like 8:45, so just use your devices for time
Yikes, that early?
Den is open till 1:30/12:30 am
I don't want to eat at the Den too often though since their food doesn't seem too healthy
Never have gnoicci pasta. It's patato based that too at little Italy. Also, never go to an Italian restaurant with friends on Valentine's day. Inflation of prices is beyond 100%
They inflate the prices just for one day? Wouldn't they need to print all of the menus again?
tfw superfan but spell her name wrong
People can get religious exceptions so it's not compulsory, it is however compulsory to either upload proof of vaccination or provide reasoning for why you aren't getting the vaccine
it looks like they are still going to make your life a living hell if you choose to get vaxxed for religous reasons. This is still up:
I’m pretty sure they’re just trying to scare people into getting it (or uploading it if they haven’t)
cause of the vague wording on the faq (and the email) they don’t really eliminate any possibilities
Yeah, but that doesn’t mean it’s still a good move while encouraging people
Like now you HAVE to go through the university if you even want to come to campus
I uploaded my vaccine certificate today and the status is “complaint/satisfied”. Isn’t it supposed to be reviewed by a nurse first?
your instructions were to "upload your card." Nothing else.
i dont remember tbh
~~given that most of them aren;t on discord, they must have a life~~
oh we have 2025s here
When your lab files will finish downloading about 12 hours from now and you have work first thing in the morning and agreed to meet with your grad student 1 hour after you come home after work so basically you’ll probably pull an all-nighter tonight because you’re a certified procrastinating idiot
I haven't slept later than like 2:30 AM in almost two months
A download taking 12 hours seems absurd even if your download speeds aren't that fast
Why would you have to stay up downloading something? Idk what your setup is but cant you zip the files, start the download, go to bed?
Last year I had to download a 60gb map of the entire world and it took a few hours tops
Granted it was file transfer over the local network but still
My home has fast internet (250 Mb/s) Ethernet but my room isn't that good for WiFi so I only get like 15 Mb/s and even then it only takes me 12 hours to download a massive 70 GB game
Of course not, there's all types of stuff that my computer does without me having to look it at, and that includes downloading
Initially it was 35 GB but not anymore
Well I don’t know if downloading is the right term
In that case, your Internet speed is approximately 6.48 Mb/s
The copy rate was like 600-900 mb/s though
I don’t even know what that is lol
If you want 1 Gbps
Now theres a fucking cricket when im trying to take a shit and I can't move
Cicadas were super annoying
~~u will~~
i have the book if u want it 👀
You don’t need it I promise you
the professor is not gonna require me to buy shit right
i hate buying things
Nope
Drew doesnt give a single crap
nope
i dont even know if i'll get him
i haven't selected my classes yet
Some would beg to differ but their opinions are just wrong lol
however, i hate chem soooo
Online chem is a pain
and it's worse when u don't like it :')
i don't know why theres so much thermo shit but sure
chem is one of the main reasons i don't want premed owo
I don’t know how ochem will go for me but so far I love chem
I grinded out practice titration problems so hard for the final exam and right after that I forgot everything
Oh I struggled with that in 106
Because yknow end of freshman year
y'all take math 121?
Lame
all math is lame though
so both of u are lame
didn't you just tell me that you're looking forward to the math class
math is lame
r u so lonely that ur calling others children
ur a child raunak
r u so lonely that ur calling other people children as well
tbf we're all lonely here
You called me child then went on to say that people who call others a child are lonely. Hence, you are lonely
we're all lonely so what's your point
why do i feel like this is middle school
my braincells are on the edge of overloading so won't give u a satisfactory answer smh
cuz screw growing up
*go to sleep*
Sleepy at 2:08am
there is only est so if you're sleepy then that's too bad
*moves out of EST after college*
*still lives in EST*
Sounds wrong, but ok
imagine waking up at 6am for a 9am class...
couldn't be me but it sounds like hell for a CS major
See I think you should have just lived in cleveland and gone to a UC remotely
Lmaooo I have a cali friend that legitimately wants to remotely work in hawaii from east coast
They would have to stay up late methinks
They sleep at like 3 AM so would work
Yeah fair
I've already had dinner and they're only late afternoon
I’m about to sleep and they still have daylight
I mean last year when I was working only 30 hours a week with both australians and people in europe I'd get a fuckton of work done when it was midnight, when everyone was online
Or was this just school
to be fair I just kinda wrote bug reports
Psh that's still experience
well I didn't actually code
and to be fair, the way I "got in" was a pure fairytale so I just consider myself lucky
It deadass involved writing my head of school a note about how he should get a bowl cut
Thanks to adults charging $50+ per hour, I was able to charge $25/hour last year
The only reason I'm on Discord rn is because I'm legit stuck on the lab report and am waiting for my TA or (@chandachan ) to respond
Lab 4: I don't know how to calculate the theoretical time constant
bruh with my first client i asked for like 20/hour without realizing how much ppl charge lmao
This is why I make half my money in tips and don’t report it to the irs
It’s ethical to dodge taxes if you’re poor
sorry let me rephrase:
**the entire server shifts right on tax day**
well u don't have to pay taxes if you make under a certain amount
On the other hand, there's no income tax
yeah but poor people still have to pay it
U still pay social security and some stuff like that
It’s just that u general don’t have to file cause they just take it out of your paycheck
The grey states are those without a sales tax?
CA's taxes are so high even though they have a large budget surplus
To this day I’m still confused about how that’s possible
I don't know about Orange County specifically, but California generally has lower than average property taxes
David's model bouta account for the productivity loss due to lost sleep and freshman stealing food
Finn don't thonk me :smiling_gun:
Still expensive
Unless you wanna stay in school forever
well I've learned to accept gentrification isn't the enemy here
11 hours a day on Productivity & Finance? 🧠
11 hrs a day checking stonks
thats the shit
Day trading is usually a bad idea lol, it takes a lot of time and usually leads to worse returns than just buy and hold
YouTube would be counted as "Productivity and Finance" because apparently Google Chrome is "productivity and finance"
helps a shit ton with liquidity
idk about y'all but every time i think about packing for school i'm like "oh i don't need to bring much" but then i get worried that i may be missing a whole list of things lol
I'm doing it by looking online for guides and trying to keep a record of what things I use frequently or that I need
still need to get a fan and a hamper
Electronics and accessories alone are really big for me, I want to take my desktop (almost 20 lbs), my laptop, my phone, chargers, batteries, headphones, multiple monitors, etc.
because what if you choose to work in KSL?
I just realized how small my desk will be (4 feet wide) so I can't fit that much stuff on it
For the times I have had to pack for long stays I always missed something
i actually never packed and thought of leaving room in my bags
maybe a cwru crewneck but idk
I've come back with a car plate, a horn, weird food, books and other random stuff
Are there any thrift shops near campus?
ok the second option isn't showing
idk if i'll buy a lot of merch
I doubt I even want free case merch. It looks ass
I left the merch with friends but I have the chain reaction t-shirt
Are you still in CLE?
I've made a promise to myself tho. I won't watch bigg boss on campus
If I die today just know that it was all jenin’s fault
if you don't see a speed limit sign, there is none
Oh that’s good cause I forgot to bring my glasses anyway
I didn't even see that until you mentioned it lol, I'm surprised you read The Daily
cancel the school
they also did a bunch of fuckery with the pay last year
what happened
and yet the president has 3 top of the line imacs on his desk
ok so were the profs underpaid last year?
cuz of online classes?
yet you charge us so much money
they are underpaid all years, just last yr more than usual
how ironic considering our tuition wasn't lowered
its gone up actually
A lot of that money goes to hiring more administrators instead of faculty
kaler wants a 4th
he needs to get a gold one to match his rolex
im slow
he didn't win lol
How did he not win, that seems like an important issue
no idea. i really thought he had a shot. i think people were skeptical that he wouldn't be able to achieve that goal
I don't think they can do that
they dont
I don't think so, they make recommendations to the university but the Board of Trustees makes the decisions
barbara wasnt much better
then why can't you run a fake campaign and then just do that anyway
It doesn't matter tho, the USG doesn't have any real power
yeah they don't
Tenured faculty can't be fired easily though
tbh idk if this school's faculty is really that sus in terms of criminal and sexual allegations but hey i could be completely wrong and don't know the entire story
If they were sus, you wouldn't know tho
i literally could have went to pitt and stayed at home and not in housing
oh rip 💀
what the fuck
oh
i thought pgh is short for pittsburgh
thats the airport IATA
I see why they didn't go with that because "Pit" kinda has a negative connotation
Um I don't get it?
ive never been to the ohio river
I have and I don't even live in Ohio
southern ohio is p messed up i never go there lol
except for cincy sometimes
sorry did i sneeze?
the last one being the allegheny
It was a joke, but I guess it missed :Angryhaha:
i didn't think it really sounded like a sneeze oop
are you trying to dox me
Lol I'm gonna need more than that to doxx you
||if u guys can’t tell i’m kidding and although i do work at this lab i used it to get people to fill it out💀||
aight once i get back to my dads office i’ll pm you
dunno about the housing
what the fuck remove it then?
and they dont like that
i like how they outline the dangers of asbestos but don't say whether or not the campus is asbestos-free
Afaic asbestos is fine as long as you don't tear up the floor
There aren't many universities that would voluntarily say that their campuses could cause cancer
well then if you don't want to say it, maybe remove the shit?
Those mesothelioma ads are so common, I'm surprised that the lawyers have that much money to advertise
haven't y'all complained about how the school hasn't renovated the buildings for half a century?
so idk
do the maths
damn, this is how the common rooms used to look
fuck
didn't taft house get renovated
I looked up "When was asbestos banned" and I was startled to find that it has not been banned in the US yet
A bill was introduced in 2002 but it didn't pass
cuz
Actually this bill died in the House of Reps but it passed in the Senate
It unanimously passed in the Senate so I'm surprised it did not pass in the House
weatherhead isnt a dorm :thonk:
holy shit
Buy my air conditoner
I'm working 💪💪
I just went quickly through messages
It’s so sad and infuriating tbh
i’m not paid 💀 i WISH
yet they have a 11.26 billion endownment... what a bunch of cheap fucks
I don't like thinking about it
Oh
Didn’t catch that oop
Oh, so B+ means "be positive"
@jujulb you forgot religious exemptions
Oh 😂
Shit whoops
if something hurts it’s probably not supposed to
stop i watch so many tiktoks about the college board because they pop up on my fyp
Nice try, i would die of starvation before dying of cancer
yup, lotta nasty shit in those. most noticeable with bottled water, especially on a hot day, cuz that shit tastes like stagnant water.
So many vids about college show up on my insta feed too😭
Like dear collegevine, idgaf about the ACT anymore and how to get into Harvard ok?
Incinerators would produce lot of toxic waste tho
That is an issue with regular combustion. NYC's waste disposal system does incinerate the trash, and the incinerator has a filter to collect toxic fumes so they don't pollute the atmosphere
There's a startup in my building that's trying to do that, they are wack:
https://www.electroactive.tech/
Imma read their page when I’m less dead
I be sleepy
lol idk exactly how their shit works
Heat. The plasma not only vaporizes the material, but vaporizes the molecular bonds holding atoms in place. The plasma state is when electrons are freed from the nuclei cuz they're moving around so fast electromagnetic shits aren't strong enough to hold atoms together.
Tho in the process of cooling the atomized materials, the heat can be harnessed so that some energy put in can be salvaged
does anyone know the case id of someone who was in tippit last semester?
Oh you on an accelerator? What you doing
I was in one in my country but didn't get to finalist round (more benefits)
I personally do energy storage for air conditioning
@addat AC systems are as cold as his roasts
Fuck you
can't believe @chandachan didn't invite me to his birthday party😔
is there an Apple store nearby campus?
There's an Apple store within Barnes and Nobles
It’s much worse than other strains and first cases of it were seen in India (I think)
damn
imma drop the first class that assigns me homework
*gets homework from every class at the same time*
Janssen doesn't seem to be very good against it
Maybe not I could be wrong
We don't need the iolab right?
Like "he has std" means he is missing something in a homework or paper
My health class taught me another meaning for STD😳
That is the lowest possible price increase though since they can't increase it by less than a cent
It's not a 100% tho, it's like 87% or something and some studies put it even lower, like 60-70% (For Pfizer)
What’s wrong with digital documents
I hate lugging around all that paper
I mean unless the professor wants me to print homework
*that i can't do*
idk how y'all can read
theres a reason why pianists are insanely talented
Oh so I have 40 dollars by default
8 cents per page isn't too bad if you aren't printing tons of stuff
Wow my dissertation is gonna have a FAT price tag
I generally don't like annotating my sheet music or books cuz then it degrades the media
I don't know if I'll print often enough to "break even" tho
Unless my SAGES class wants me to print stuff often
Oof nothing is working I guess lol
~~can we not need honorlock~~ ;0
~~I’ve only used LockDown Browser~~
Apparently Honorlock flags you talking and I legit talk during every single exam 😬
Either that means the professors don't check my Honorlock or they had to sit through all my ramblings
I don't get it
~~not me mocking people if they mess up in hindi tho~~
rip
LMAO im actually flying delta for vacation tho
It would be bad to have the second flight cancelled and then I'm temporarily stuck in the city of the layover
I’ll be honest I haven’t traveled much, but from my experiences thus far I really like Delta
My parents didn’t have to but that’s probably because they were traveling internationally
I am flying with delta cause it was the cheapeast option
Sir I ain’t rich I fly economy
I had an 8 hour 30 min layover in Delhi tho
"Your flight has been canceled" *Intense screaming*
Bruh don’t remind me😭😭😭
Oh, Kush is from Mumbai ahhh
Don't come to Delhi now. It's 36 degrees Celcius therw
I'm going tom. It'll be a pain
I never want to go to Delhi
Last time I went I *cried*
Sigh
ye columbus isnt too far off
it was raining like crazy a week ago
That's some massive hemorrhage. It's sometimes scary to think about aneurysms also
oh gawddddddd
WTF
this is my school district !
HOLY FUCK
ye i dont do buzzfeed or snap
earlier that calendar year (2019) the district underwent radical rebranding too
I forgot to respond to this but geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez💀💀💀
All of my old school district’s scandals are 18+
the american school system is cursed. imma teach my kids to be able to venture out into the world on their own and make it big, so they won't need those crutches
never
I don’t think I understood what you meant but I saw tw: ||blood and burn|| and am……. Concerned
Oh
My dad has 0 tolerance on tattoos though
what if i hate it later on
Idk if tattoos are forbidden in my religion
^ same but I kinda left my religion so my ex religion lol
I would get sad once they started peeling
*never*
You’re stressed? Just don’t be
I should go do my work too but instead I will look for more dorm stuff ~~and clothes~~
I need to do that..m
~~haven’t really updated my wardrobe since freshman year of hs~~
Lmao mood I havent since like junior year
*jenin sends you plane ticket*
besides im gonna have so many eventually it wont matter
i left with no piercings tatts or anything and im coming back with 4 earrings and maybe a tattoo
only thing im missing is a nicotine dependence for bingo
If I got a tattoo it would say “Universal Donor” on my forehead so when I died people would think I was a universal donor and I would be cool
Idk what blood type I am though
How can someone not spend >10 mins a day on hygiene, I spend that much time just on oral hygiene
You havent meet engineering students
I'm technically a School of Engineering student
holy fuck
How are you so committed to working?
You keep saying I have work to do now and then actually leave so dedication
i go to CWRU and have nothing to do atm
cuz i'm doing a lot of work in a short amount of time 😎
cuz if this isn't productive then i might as well watch anime 24/7
I can do once a month if you want to use it more
Never have I ever procrastinated on my work this much
Work at 8 am teehee sleepy time
i heard nothing
Cam, why are you still adding classes????
oh we can still had? (or change our classes?)
Until the end of the first 2 weeks of school
Right now we can’t add because freshmen need to register
Last year, my navigator was able to edit my courses for me
Accidentally left my phone in the refrigerator today 🤡
I went to grab some water and what usually happens is I replace the bottle in the refrigerator with a bottle of water from outside so there's always a bottle of cool water waiting for me but I was holding my phone so I think what happened is that I just stuck my phone in there instead 💀
im the most absent minded person i know so that doesnt sound like a stretch
Go do your work
plz I can't find any forum online to ask about stuff that is going on
Hey guys I almost died on the way home today🥰✨
What happened?
Or you could use a DNA/RNA extraction kid from Qiageb!like a normal lab. Unless you want proteins too and are running some type@of CHIPor COIP. For qPCR all you need are DNA. If you have rna Yoy need to use reverse transcriptase with OLLIGOdna
Sorry I just got my wisdom teeth out so I’m woozy
Additionally I would like you to find a protocol/description for RNA extraction from bone tissue- we might want to do qPCR to see if electric stim increases gene expression associated with bone regen
I think the med-student wrote it incorrectly in a hurry and that can be used to test gene expression
I'm getting them out today
i was driving down this one road, and was passing a neighboorhood's entrance. at the point i was directly in front of that entrance, i noticed in my peripheral vision that this big black SUV is turning and is probably gonna hit me. as soon as i look out my side window i see the car's head literally centimeters away from mine and i swerved to the right. my sister was with me and she said the lady had a look of horror on her face (as she should, she was being extremely dumb)
But oh well idk
i honked for a good 5 seconds as she was behind me because omg lady can you even drive
I still need to research on the bone markers tho for lit review
Was her speed fast or it was slow?
Fuck her
im still surprised that i didn't get hit
~~i don't think its original but ty~~
😥 didn’t mean it that way
its been a while since you were on here
Sorry I’m still high after my wisdom tooth surgery
i think the world is testing me by throwing shit at me every day
It's not a surgery tho. It's an extraction
an oral *surgeon* does the procedure tho
if i take out your heart won't that be a surgery?
regardless, still surgery
No one calls it a surgery tho atleast not the net
it can still be called surgery np
you can call it an extraction or a surgery, it literally doesn't matter
some people get their wisdom teeth out before they come in, in which the oral surgeon would have to *cut* the gum to pull them out
i can't believe this topic is still going on
i tried to end it just now
*sigh*
Face and jaws damn
I don't understand some of the naming conventions for dental procedures
Your grandfather won't be able to watch TV for 3 days after his surgery?
I went more than 3 days without watching TV just this week, so I'm used to it
I'm not sure. I prefer wearing glasses right now and never even considered contacts.
Same. My mom pushes me for it but it's considered to be as dangerous as open heart surgery and people view hollow images down the line
Which is scary
I went to an optometrist lately and my eyes didn't change much, I got a little bit more farsighted and astigmatism in one eye vanished but got slightly worse in another eye
Same, except near sighted in my case
But astigmatism is still there
I've seen robot- assisted cardiac surgeries in Operation Theatres. It's mad
Not really
When I was in Bosnia I spent two years without tv
Indian hospital. This was like 11th grade mostly
I do not currently plan to get LASIK since I'm worried about complications. I'll still consider it though and I have plenty of time to think about it
Laser eye surgery
He doesn't have any power tho so doesn't need correction but got it so he looks more experienced as a doctor lol
I wish I had eyes that good
When I'm not wearing my glasses and looking at something close, it feels like I can't "focus" on it
For me it's the opposite I can't see stuff far away
I don’t think you can get hyperopia
Since the focal length of your eye lenscan’t increase
None of my family members wears spectacles yet I do. Nothing genetic at all
I maybe nerdy but can't think of anything other than thin layer chromatography for that rn
"I felt my heart crack"
On another note, if you wanna feel your heart crack go to heart attack grill and eat the 20000 calorie burger
Last I heard it has a 95% success rate. I would love love love to have my awful vision fixed but I don’t think it’s worth risking going blind for LASIK
I still struggle to wrap my head around the fact that you can see things clearly that are far away but not things closer to your eyes lol
I can see trees that are several hundred feet away well but text that is 10 feet away from my eyes looks blurry
My near-sightedness is so bad everything is blurry for me
Unless it’s less than 2 inches away from my eyes
I'm getting new glasses in a few days since I just visited an optometrist last week
I still need to schedule my appointment and I should’ve gotten my glasses prescription updated
I've never used contacts, I only wear glasses
I'm not that lucky, a lot of young people don't use glasses or contacts
Luckier than me though
I got the texts several hours earlier
if so they really need to change that
thankfully my prescription hasn’t changed too badly
oh and what ended up happening with Panera?
argh my bootleg surround sound system speaker wires didnt work, curse you amazon
Wtf
When your eye doctor appointment is at 4:20 pm😌
shame shame
AW FUCK
It’s a shame they’re making vaccines for COVID and not for the real virus - New Jersey. #FireFauci #FactsDontCareAboutYourFactsCareDontYourCareDontFactsFeelingsAboutDont
it slowly eats away at you
Has it gone to shit since the last time I went
Technically though my destination is Fresno my aunt is picking me up

Hey man I’ll be in Cleveland in three weeks cut me some slack
I thought you wanted to get out?
I did but it’s still home lol

Don’t you live in Seattle

@bravo5127 you already consented to my plan sorry

Yes but I’m bad at physics
I’ve read that the alcohol could actually be bad for your teeth/drying for your mouth but I guess it all comes down to what works for everyone
does anyone have some suggestions for mischief i could get up to bc i am so bored
I have legit never used mouthwash, might need to start using it considering brushing my tongue is a very uncomfortable experience
omg brushing your tongue is rough
You can do this without getting in trouble by joining the BGC
It's mainly used for preventing gum disease, but it might clean your tongue too
I went to the dentist recently and he told me that I did not have any new cavities (even though I haven't gone in a long time) 🥳
~~that was me during quarantine last year~~
i still forget to eat and sometimes ill be hungry and will be too lazy to get food oop

my full name doesnt fit on my drivers license
Dw it didn’t make sense
someone's desperate to find out
No I won’t tell him
I don’t even know who @chandachan is
I bet I won’t see him in person
why would you include spaces cuz that's counting characters then
nope
I can probably find your middle name somewhere but im too tired
nope
nope
nope
thankfully someone gets it
i was gonna do a leg reveal in the selfies channel today since i was hitting leg day

I was imagining a pretty strong nose, it'd be kinda pog
nose with abs
I don't live in the states, could't find it
my nose is all kinds of fucked up bc i had 🅱️ ovid

Holy fuck

we're here if u ever need to talk to anyone :D
does anyone actually use the vc here anymore?
guess i havent seen anyone in one since ive been active again lololol
it was most active last summer and this past school year
idk im not one to start conversations tho i prefer to hop in once someone else already started them 😪
yo its a fucking HURRICANE OUTSIDE
We had a really bad storm today and my tree lost another huge branch☺️
@addat I’d join but I have to say goodbye to my parents
Bad night
I meant lost sleep
Ugh nvm my mind is spinning rn
pls tell my parents that T_T ~~i'm sleeping 8 hours wym~~
Damn
I was having a good night sleep then this happened
guys do I do a stupid
ok so i did the huge stupid
and wow can I say my legs hurt
I guess that it's a good thing I didn't sign up for a flight that arrives at 1 AM since we can only move in at specific times of day lol
It's annoying that this information wasn't announced sooner
I'm starting to get worried about CWRU going back to Zoom classes once the Delta variant flares up on campus
Oh whoops nvm then
Today I even went on a MS teams call
based as a roasted racoon caught in a trap constructed of barbedwire and a torsion spring fished from a discarded toy truck and seasoned with fresh herbs grown in a mini garden made of a collection of boots taken from the feet of sleeping homeless lesbians in Atlanta and grains of salt grinded from a block of pink Himalayan salt taken from the delivery van of a local high quality grocery chain that had it shipped straight through the suez canal during March 2021 and cooked inside a makeshift oven made from the radiator of a 1981 Ford F100 inside the small shack in the corner of a swath of trees I rent for $50/month from the multimillionaire that owns this property as well as a small collection of Canadian bookstores that specialize in existentialist Japanese and Lebanese novels
i have consumed 1 redbull i feel alive
I need some questions answered...
grad school?
it doesnt matter where you went, as long as u can prove u kno ur stuff
aight, probably could end up in normal #memes😂 then
dunno, dont really plan on going, if you have good grades and willing to die for the next 10yrs
I just wanted to make that clear
@addat i don't have lawyers in america, you need to take care of my legal battles
@addat sad bro
a work visa
it is work visa
since your employer will be sponsoring you
it was prolly something stupid
It wasn’t
he's still 17 right?
fuck
idk you can't ride a bike so...
fuck off
well to be brutally fair I'm not bringing a bike
Sigh
they don't have those i think, we're going for smart scooters
Speaking of bikes, today I learned that when my dad was my age he closed his eyes while biking home just for fun and hit a music professor
but can he drive a bike with no legs?
that's how I'm getting around campus so don't wreck my bike
too late
excuse me i'm sleepy <3
u finna die
eventually, yes i will die
"a gentle reminder that I stepped on the lagoon responsibly, as in I didn't do it at night, stoned out of my mind like everyone else. It was also like 15 degrees that day without wind chill. Yet I'm still the bad guy here."
*takes longer to delete that post lmao*
"a gentle reminder that I stepped on the lagoon responsibly, as in I didn't do it at night, stoned out of my mind like everyone else. It was also like 15 degrees that day without wind chill. Yet I'm still the bad guy here."
fuck i don't want it to be august rn
you know what this means tho
i'm in no-privacy territory and am about to sleep so sorry :D
hi in no-privacy territory and am about to sleep so sorry :D
dont shit in the showers
*last
oh damn
it would be a very short tour, the suite is about 7-8 paces long
Howdy is moving in early too??
Nothing?
Zhanda would be main character though
Howdy would…. Idk
it would be a very lame sitcom since 2 are OL's and I have a job
or just TISTY for short
and never use the bathrooms in sears, I've seen atleast 2 cockroaches vibin in there
Only 2? Clearly you haven’t been to my middle school’s basement
Or my middle school in general
Once a girl opened her math binder in class and a cockroach sped out of it
Sometimes I’d see dead ones on the side of the hallways
Oh and once in 8th grade English it was silent during class and we heard a small thud and turns out a cockroach fell from the ceiling into the teacher’s marker bin
and they started to deteriorate after year 1 and at least 1/3 of them had problems with leaking during rain
Crap it’s almost 1
I tried🥲
It's the same? Omg could I have it where do I get it from
don't buy the paper textbook, just buy the access software called mindtap which is required for spanish classes here - it comes with the e-textbook
huh i didn't use "am"
you lost me at second person
there’s a rest stop in ca called casa de fruta and I thought it was a gay bar at first
Rip I threw it in the trash
Plus I deleted it cuz I didn’t wanna dox anyone
@chandachan next time on vc DONT MOVE
Also who the fuck is Christopher Deshaun Damaskos
oh shit
Last time I checked they didn’t approve my overall list of vaccines, and didn’t upload documentation for each vaccine
Yeah I submitted an overall list that hasn't been approved
I didnt notice a fire alarm w/ my cloud 2s
you probs dont need it
Really
I didnt see any of that
Do we take those exams there or we have to arrive with them
If you don’t have them all I think you can request an exemption
I think Case is more worried about COVID rn
Sadly I guess
Even though nothing has changed for me
It’s v annoying
It’s not mandatory tho
Oh it’s not?
Because they never pushed for those vaccines
Oh yeah cause paying a bunch of money is so easy
It started in early July in the UK this year
I would like to see HIV gone
literally his fucking job
well MyHealthConnect doesn't show anything about HIV so I guess we don't need to do testing for that
LOL sorry I was reallyyyyy sleepy last night
oh yeah I wasn't even aware of how Reagan handled AIDs before I took the class
I gotta be honest I’ve never seen a more coordinated team in my life
They lost 😔
I saw it’s sad :((
Someone texted me thinking I’m this dude she talked to on Hinge and wanted to go out with him and I told her she has the wrong number
Or I leave her on read
Shit
Case always said that they were going to require masks if we didn’t reach 80%
For the school year
Yeah fair. But they dropped it when there’s hardly anyone on campus
still a drop
Not the whole student body
this is true, but i never claimed about the whole student body
just letting you know case did a thing you didnt expect
i dunno why you seem to want to be right here
It was literally just a clarification but go off I guess
Yeah howdy lmk I guess I forgot lol
couldn't y'all at least argue over something I could hop in on
The CDC should have never said that vaccinated people could stop wearing masks when they clearly knew many people politicized the vaccine and refused to get it
And that is a hill I will die on
Oh damn
Sorry I totally forgot abt my achievements in theoretical physics
Ofc it had yet to happen but it happened too soon
very short lived
cant say we werent expecting it
last year as soon as covid started to stabilize we opened up our economy almost immediately (i get that the economy can't crash but come on) and this year the CDC let us go maskless too early
so yeah we don't make the smartest decisions
even when we're outside?
not bad
They didn't even slow down for the turn i was bouta scream
@zacharious thank god nothing happened to you
If you died I would be sad for the entire semester
I wasn't even involved lmao
im actually laughing so hard that im pissing my pants
if no one joins u r octangular and lame
ok i really dont wanna ping ppl bc they get annoyed by that so ill just chill until 2est
my sister got her braces off and she looks like she put on 3 years in 2 hours
My dentist went to cwru for dental school
My school district’s superintendent went to cwru for undergrad
nah it’s just odd because a lot of people in nj/ny don’t really know what case is 💀
Oh dw lots of people in cbus don’t know what Case is
I lost my cwru mask
No offense, but this is a terrible idea. We already have cutler dorm, cutter dorm and clarke--last thing we need is one named after craig.
okay i don't think we'd call it craig though
though i will admit it lacks the flair of craig
I mean I can't recall knowing about the people that actually have their names on buildings, so I guess newmark should do
sorry I didn't hear that
Don’t you Ross emote me
Are you in middle school
Like idk
Don’t you daaaamn her
i think ur gonna be doing more than just crying
Oh?
dying
Don’t worry he’s too broke to send a hit man
omg we have so many
after those 3 am late night caffiene fueled sprints to finish the problem sets due ~~tomorrow~~ today
I tried😔
That was so bad
I haven’t watched much of her movies
Idk
Idk
Yea I can. You don’t have the link?
Except, I don’t know how to simp lololol
you simp for med school
Priyanka: I don't know how to simp
Also Priyanka: **watches incoming case med students with a pair of binoculars and takes notes**
~~i don't like to flex and thought they copy pasted that email to everyone~~
no, I'm scared that people will only view me as a gpa
but you guys are my friends, you guys aren't med school 🫂
Priyanka only replying to texts with “med school” in it. Confidence I think not

Don’t be shy raunak say it
I need humor, I've been writing documentation all day
I need humor, I’ve been procrastinating packing all day
@raunakwastaken you can’t just say you have a cursed joke and not tell us
on the topic of people's moods tho
@sprinkles2108 who hurt you
@howdy_. please rename her to med school
@raunakwastaken still waiting
Watch raunak say he forgot the joke
im sawwy 😢  Good news is that in two weeks you will live with a 6'4" nine year old name Zhanda Chen who will piss you off instead of the adults
Zhanda is not as annoying irl as those adults though
Ok so we declare raunak annoying then?
I thought you didn’t have any friends
cuz that gif
is like m&ms
Keep trying bitch
Who is med school simp and why do they have the same pfp as me
cuz zhanda
You have the smokers role that’s worse
“OMG I’m such a crackhead”
Never said that but ok
@howdy_. I don’t like that shade of blue
Ok but why am I still on horny jail
Why isn’t raunak in horny jail
Why aren't you in there
Nah my bad
I don’t find it weird
No because Cleveland doesn’t get cold
Imma steal your blankets if it gets cold then
you wont need thick blankets in the dorm, they are mini ovens
however, if you arent experienced with cold, you'll need em when walking about
Regular winter jackets won’t suffice
I'm the kind that prefers not to use ac so hopefully I won't need it
In the US we love to blast the AC wherever we can ~~except college dorms~~
I'll try to do exercise during the night if it gets too cold
oh hush you
Oh really?
smh my head
I hope I dont meet many karens
never step into sears then
Why do you want to be a professor
That's good practice tho, I love it when someone explaining code or anything takes the time to explain possible errors and how to fix them
Turns out it is really hard to get an algorithm to find the properties of ice freezing so a human has to do that. Not me tho.
idk ur a nerd
also hard coded algorithms, while they require more domain knowledge, are easier to debug
idk if I even qualify as a nerd anymore
like if your self driving car crashes how u gonna know why if it relies solely on a black box algo
for example this conversation going on here makes me feel like a dunce
then i just need to b an expert at frog and monky
prob need hundreds at least
that doesn’t reassure me in the least
why is that what I decided to hyper-fixate on stupid adhd
Fuck you
If you want to come to TN and spend an entire summer looking at water droplets, feel free to be my intern
Guess where my cousin went to college 😌
i'm sorry but the cosmos has spoken
Well bellevue is still south of kirkland so
So relative to the other Washington I'm still a southern boy
Still from the west coast
When I drive up from my adoptive home, I made it my intention to not stop there and go right through
At least it ain’t Washington
Idk what ur on
I don’t honestly
Deep down inside she wants to move to TN and write air conditioner documentation
Are you forgetting med school?
Med school is a scam
Life is a scam cause you never signed up for it
But if you weren’t born how would you get into med school?
In their med school classes😍☺️
since "i chose to be their son" i can't complain about anything
She was trying to make a joke
I should stop trying
I know. I never am
katie ledecky got nothing on priyanka
I could program you guys a bot that automatically saves all the deleted stuff if anyone wants to do the hosting
Howdy doesnt snitch
sorry ma'am, but it's all good
FUCK
these were supposed to be all 🇪moji letters
What did I miss
Idk man
shit wrong order
I don't have a gift but I recently 3d modeled a keyboard if you want to make a piano animation or something
idk why the background isn't transparent but whatever
why do you also want me ded
@moseslee are you still in Cali
Omg stop ghost pinging me
last day at da lab
It’s been 2 years since I’ve been to Pittsburgh
not like i plugged it 2 weeks ago 😴
@sprinkles2108 does your financial aid still say pending?
@Med School simp
Yes mine is still pending
chris didn't say "med school" first tho
med school
woah woah woah why am i a med school simp
@Med School simp
Because people hate us😌
What's wrong with being a med school simp lol
I want my PhD tooo
So grad school simp is a more appropriate title
If I really was a med school simp
I mean if it wasn't for COVID, you may have done more, so don't be too hard on yourself lol
Even without Covid lol😂
And I’m not worried honestly
Haven’t touched my lab work in 2 weeks😎🤡🤡
Are you working on a research paper?
Sadly tiny brain neel has no big brain
Let alone md phd
Same tho
ayeee aspiring grad school gang
oh god... I used to think that the last thing I wanted was Neel being my doctor. Now, the last think I want is Neel teaching my doctor how to be a doctor.
i actually want to get into research more than academia
Pre meds can’t go a day without saying “oh I’m not doing this for money. I really love helping others”
fine, the last thing I want is neel supplying the research that my doctors use
unless you have breasts i don't think the research i want to pursue is applicable
but then again idk 😉
first of all, you didn't specify. Second of all, male breast cancer is real
from what i gather, female breast cancer has 3 types, Her2, HR, triple negative. men do too. but when you study breast cancer you use cells/tissue derived from women, in the above categories. the male environment isn't well studied or researched because of its rarity.
i don't want to stare at plastic ppl all day tho
1% is still more than what I would’ve guessed
the point is that he doesn't pretend like he is doing it for other motives
Yeah it’s sad how many people are pre med because of money
priyanka, even if you're not doing it for the money, with all due respect you're reinforcing his point
Oh I know. He’s not wrong
But also fuck cancer
looks like someone has a superiority complex...
who says imma do cs in grad school
And the air is trash
no fires here... yet
zach can try me if he wants
you seriously carry that with you?
that's not too bad
Everywhere i live has had bad air
Nah actually I’d be dead by then because a lot of diseases are very far from having a cure
And with climate change on the rise… no way will docs be unemployed because new conditions can emerge or more people just get more sick
@raunakwastaken you used the Ross emote wrong
nope i did not. i wasn't feeling well
and i don't think i'll be able to stream cause im leaving tomorrow
wtf? the us is winning the olympics for the 50th time? who wouldve guessed
I am excited about that. Neeraj Chopra did really well. Oh, I didn't know USA won so many times. Mb then
Also happy belated birthday Moses 🎂. Sorry for not wishing sooner
Yeah, and it it happened on the same street I'll be living on and only a block away 😬
That's the worst I think
Plum market is danger. I'm not going there alone now
That too this happened in the morning 😳
I guess plum’s crazy prices aren’t the only thing that’s doing the robbing around here
@absence000 are you still in cutler :cursed_flushed:
i need money lol
everyone else is wrong
Where will you go alone then?
These shortages are becoming absurd, there's even a luggage shortage now... 😬
basically car makers are eating computer chips up like zhanda on leutner pasta night and there are none left for me
oh pog
if you need me to hook you up with soldering irons lmk
but i gotta be up for work tmrw
i only have the main component tho
I don’t think you have to pay for that
quarantine food sucks ass
Not yet in my country, next month, so no
Did you go straight there from the airport?
Shit you’re missing Discover Week then?
A few germs never killed anyone
You… left it outside somewhere?
Oh
Is Starbucks covered by the meal plan? Doesn't seem like it but I'm not sure
It’s def not included in regular meal swipes and idk if they count toward special swipes (highly doubt it though). Special swipes work at Dunkin
dunkin donuts is portable swipes, starbucks is retail and you will need to use actual cash
This is ok, I was scared wverything will be super expensive
as long as you stay away from plum, prices are somewhat okay (sorta)
if u want to hang your clothes 👀
I brought my own though
What's the easiest way to get to the nearest Target? I found an article from two years ago about a pilot program for shuttles to Target on the weekend but I don't know if that's still going on
I’ve heard the shuttle is still a thing. Goes to Target and Walmart on Saturday @_frostyyyyy_
dont refer to those doughnuts as bagels 🤮
how did you end up in STJ
accident happened when trying to coordinate a suite
i got left out
I WISH THAT HAPPENED TO ME
BUT STILL
clean bathroom
we can swap if u want :fingerguns:
@howdy_. can u get these anywhere near campus https://guayaki.com/
I need my yerba
its hit or miss normally
dunno
you might be able to get it at plum
it seems bouje enough for them to stock it
tHE CLOSEST PLACE IS 4.2 MILES AWAY
sorry im having a moment
i'm not trying to be helpful tho
i forgot how to spell your name
so i went with that
:crying:
i went to the RTA on a saturday morning so there was only one person there
i wanted to pass her and we made eye contact ~~and i nodded in salute or something idk~~
and she went 
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME BITC? DO I KNOW YOU? DO YOU KNOW ME?? NO! GET OFF MY FACE BITSH
when the rta came and i sat with my suitcase on the floor, she simply passed with her bicycle and got it purposefully stuck to my suitcase :wobble:
but defo scary
i was too sleepy to be scared and just minded my business to avoid actual bad contact :LAUGHING:
people aside, RTA trains smell horrible :nkoWuahWomit:
so sos sososs bad
shit takes FOREVER
i am trying
its a matter of do they want me to be
The rta goes from the airport?
Also, u know how could use the pass if I haven't been on campus?
You can’t get it until you’re on campus
I won't be available at 3 pm at those timings tho
It doesn't fit my schedule. I would like to do math, chem as TA
I'll probably go there about once a month then. I'm ordering a bunch of things online from Target right now but I'll have to go there in-person in the future since the minimum purchase for most items to be shipped is $35 and some items like hangers are only sold in-store
Is it bad to have like 10 packages in Wade when I arrive? Even when I order items at the same time, each box has 2-3 items in it. I don't want Wade to start trashing my stuff since I have too many packages
and it is not bad
@_frostyyyyy_ I'd say think of things or clothes you most likely use for two weeks and order the things you don't need just after
Shuttle busses though
I'm buying almost everything on Target's website, they do free shipping on almost all items for orders above $35 except for some large cheap items like paper towels
But on the way home last semester I got it all in a suitcase
I want to save space in my suitcase for clothes instead
Yeah that’s fair
Cause if the suitcase is over 50 pounds they fuck you
Ordering stuff on Amazon or whatever isn’t too bad
Shipping stuff is a pain tho
I just got an email from Packcity saying that I have to pick up a package in a locker at Wade by 8/16/2021, how worried should I be? Will they move it to another location after that time instead of the locker?
I'm arriving on 8/18/2021 so I can't get the package right now
they move it to the wade office iirc
Thanks, I was already worried about deadlines for picking up packages and that email just exacerbated my fear
Okay, Housing confirmed that the packages get transferred to the office from the lockers and then I'll need to pick them up there
I'm stuck at the airport, good time for the rta to not be working
money go br
Last time I ubered
I literally didn't spend a penny from airport to room
I thought the RTA wasn't working when you were there?
Man you won't belive it
Supposedly there was a huge storm last night that made the rta to stop working right when I arrived
Don’t I need a card or smt
For more money you can get it for any train line or for more days
I went without paying and two cops approached me
Cause the train didn't pass so I ended up taking too much time in there so ofc they had time to get there
If they have a car they’d drive lol
If they don’t they’d probably take the rta …
I was like my bad I dont have coins and the machine domt give change (which is all tru, like wtf imma supposed to do get 20 dollars worth of train tickets)
yeah it might be different at an airport
This is my time to shine I have a bag of coins that weigh a fuck ton
So far my experience with cops and workers from Cleveland has been awesome I joked with a security officer at the airport too
Not if you already have a car tho
She was like " I need to take this, you can't carry it"
And I told her " that would be a bummer please don't take it" she was like you have to get rid of it i was like I would have to eat it but I can't on my own and looked at her
She laughed I said also I don't have cookies do you
Cause it was more than 100ml and it was on carry on
No lie, it's still right there in my carry on
Wtf I’m checking all the class locations and they’re so far away from North
We will be thin while south will be fat
Also guys please don’t ever walk from north to south back and forth
I know a shortcut tho and that takes 10 mins
Idk the exact schedule
Oh so it’s like 9:17 or some shit
Uhhhh idk
Wtf
Wtf is laundry view and Zellweger and whiva, also u have a car? Why parkmobile
One time dad was parking in a spot with rented car and it showed that
At the end, we used coins tho lol
Gosh it scared me I thought it was just a pic and then it started breathing , I'm sleeping alone in my whole suite, possible residence
my phone is too old for venmo so i use zelle :fingerguns:
I’m gonna take you to the Apple store and buy you a new phone
to buy computer parts that I need
Rip
U can leave me food if u want, I can show u our suite
But not today, I haven't received my card
#NeverSettle ~~when mainstream appeal isn't at stake~~
I bank with Chase and now I feel like I made the right choice since most of the other banks I was considering do not have branches in the area
idk why tf they have public transactions
As far as i know, that's a part of blockchain isn't it? That all transactions are public and that there's a way to make small, cent sized profits by checking that a transaction of someone else went through, and to make an open registration of the transaction
venmo doesnt use blockchain lol
also just cause the transactions are "public" doesnt mean u actually know whose doing them
Matt Gaetz crying sounds
Venmo actually profits off their absence of negotiation because unlike debit cards they don’t bankroll a middle man moderator to negotiate any disputes during transfers
As in, if you misspell a name or number your money is transferred to a rando and Venmo won’t lift a finger to get your money back and it all depends on the good graces of the rando
I didnt said it did. I said that the feature of making transactions public is part of the blockchain process
And 5 days after arriving im starting the weekly testing
That’s like trying to differentiate between a car and a plane in terms of transport - they both take you places so they’re not different in that aspect with the exception of travel time
Aight I’m starting my 48 hours journey to America
$50 an hour for a job that can be done from home in my spare time and apparently takes no skills
and also it pays both 300 and 400 bi-weekly apparently
oh i didnt even think about the fact that it could be twice a week
they could be offering me $700 per hour depending on how u interpret it
'dont u only need the routing number'
no no we need account name and password because our bank needs it
I got my room and residence from My Housing but if someone wants to send a package what address should he put
The website wasn't very clear
Try clicking one of the boxes on the left hand side @quintus_fabius_
Idk that was a button
All I know is that it won’t arrive directly at your dorm
Shit
Yeah I forgot Rober is on north side
@sprinkles2108 desi thumka tho
Since the shuttle to Target and Walmart leaves hourly, does that mean that there would be another shuttle an hour later that I can return on?
The system is very buggy, my time block on the main MyHousing page has changed **several** times without me doing anything and meanwhile the move-in appointment time listed in the Room Assignment Details is the same as it originally was
The last one is at 12 I think
There are some things I want to get at Target that they don't ship like 18 hangers for $2.25
Also, you can miss the bus and stay for 2 hours
i kinda skimmed the conversation and saw, "oh i forgot he lives on North side"
didnt bother to actually read, silly me
That shouldn't take a long time to do, right?
Ehhhh idk because you have to do stuff on your phone on myhealthconnect
That's fine, I'm just worried that one part of move-in will take a lot longer than I thought
You have like the entire day an extra 5min wont make or break
My flight arrives at 1:20 so getting my bags and driving will take a little over an hour
I was supposed to be at 7:40 at Wade, got at 9 pm
That makes sense. Imagine if your flight got delayed by a few hours and then CWRU didn't allow you to move in, that would be ridiculous
well idk how the next day would work haha but if you’re a few hours late with everything it won’t be a problem
only this is if you get there early they might not activate room yet
Yeah Im just considering switching now if they’d let me check in at 10 or 11 pm. Cause the last time slot is like 9 or 7 or smt so I thought the office might be closed by 10 or 11
Not to the ones that are closed because of demand though
yeah they arent open that late right?
Nope, but I booked my flight before move in times were announced
1:20 PM arrival flight on Aug 18
Nope, I just decided to do the 1:20 PM flight before move in times were announced
I was annoyed that they announced it so late though
move in times are stupid anyway
yeah but that doesnt even matter
cause u get to move in either way
no reason u cant just get tested the next day or whatever
but anyways i need to know if theyre open till like midnight or not
cause the slots dont go that late
They aint, i think its like 9pm on southside?
Ur room door is open finn
I don't want you to come in
I want ur mom to come, make a bunch of food, and leave. Thats it.
Damn
We train the alligators to go after anyone who cant bike
Dont go to bed
Youre supposed to go from 7am to 1am
Nvm I thought ols were supposed to wake up at 7am and never stop
I am only supposed to work 4 hours each day this weekend
Tomorrow is gonna be a long day though
You can't be nervous during immigration. If you say your details with confidence, they'll readily take you in otherwise they do those checks
My dad has Indian pass but never got those checks. Only mom got
And has spent 3 hours there
Can’t be be said
Idk but T-Mobile is decent
I had it for 5 years and fucking hated that bitch
I don’t know bro my family and I hated it
Yeah I can’t figure it out
Idk because im not a dealer
shit I thought this was google
I haven’t seen any places that sell sim cards in the airport
Also, it is very cold in the airport
man packing
Oh what D: I have another duel??
Let alone in the north residential village
Sports are going to be without masks? There's a bunch of people playing/watching beisbol and no one's wearing a mask
masks only required inside no?
Idk
idk thats just what makes sense in my head lol
dont quote me on that lmao
I believe when the semester starts but idk
Bruh it feels like school never ended
Fall and spring feel like a single semester
Ikr I’m still drained from last year
Ah well I didn't get an email so
There were some openings but it wouldn’t work for me
215L felt like it was a mass email so I figured I didn't have a chance, Driscoll personally emailed me for PHYS122 lab and so I figured it was a done deal
Fair
But you could still help them
Also I don't know if I'm grading anything I really have no idea 💀
Because labs aren’t fun
But they don’t idt🥲
Smart, physics isn't that important for CS majors anyways
I sucked at 122 but I somehow ended up doing ok
aye are you already working on internship apps?
I don't think I'm grading anything, I think I'm just supposed to help out in labs
I've only applied to 3 so far but I'm really busy with a lot of other stuff right now so I hope to start applying for a lot more starting about 2 weeks from now
I'm taking this fall tho
Couldn’t be me
Whoops i forgot they were In person 💀
Honestly iolabs were not THAT bad
Except for their critical design flaw
Idk man chem lab was pretty ok
It wasn’t even a lab class😂😂
Projects are definitely important. I don't have a projects section 🤡 but I have education, skills, work experience, extracurriculars, and honors
Man there’s soo much in appying
yuh it sucks
Half of the Data Structures projects last semester were Leetcode problems so you at least got some training from that
I forgot that you’re in est for a sec
There’s types of algorithms that we haven’t done in DS
You're right, 5 isn't that many
Bruh airplanes suck
damn I haven't done one yet 💀
I've only done like 15 Leetcode problems
I think leetcode problems are much easier in python tho
if anyone needs, i can send my resume for formatting ideas, it’s larry approved
NOPE
idk if that's a reputable source
he was dancing in the backyard last night
It wasn’t that terrible but they now have all my social media accounts
Except discord ofc
but yeah airport people are super racist
it sucks that that’s so many people’s first experience with America
I’m at Tudor if anyone wants to meet
Oh
Maybe another day though
I’ll be with my parents tho
oof that's the only day i won't be on campus this week
Should I use a VPN if I want to watch a movie on the internet?
nothing ever happened
I didn’t know you watched anime
idk why but they never charged me again after the first month so i just have permanent free crunchyroll ig?
its been like 8 months so hopefully they dont randomly charge me 80$ someday :THONK:
I am in quarantine I haven't watch a single movie cause my laptop broke in the flight for some reason
Damn
Ugh
Oh no!! :(((
I’m sorry to hear that
Haven't arrived
He doesn't have either lmao
I finished basically all my case cash the week before classes started because nothing was open
I’ve heard Verizon is expensive tho
i can’t attest to that because i don’t know how much it costs, i have it and i personally really like the service, but do what you think is best
Nvm Verizon and AT&T won’t work with my phone cause it’s international
But the frequency at which Verizon and att work isn’t supported by my phone model since it was made for international countries
Sorry brane slow 😔
what does phone frequency
idk :xCrittyx:
for some reason even imessage isn't working rn even tho i'm connected to the internet
You should be able to get a SIM card with a US phone number and use iMessage and all
Oh raunak I think you can use a smaller phone carrier instead of a major one like att, Verizon, T-Mobile, and sprint
Idk
My navigator is no longer at Case bruh
I had three different navigators last year
phones are sold with different LTE bands depending on what country they are sold in
there's a global model but it doesn't have US bands because carriers here are weird
its cuz *cough* monopolies and loose laws *cough*
agh i hate packing i hate packing i hate packing i hate packing
facts, just suffering from a mild panic attack mid packing operation lololol
Does anyone have EBME 201 coming on Canvas? That course didn't appear yet
When you're so lost that your navigators need their own navigators
@kaori_flute you don't need to study cs again--you just need to know what to google when needed
should be stuff in little italy if you haven't tried that yet
idk if it will be vegetarian but still
I just got told I don’t seem like a discord gal

U right tho
Oh no, the meat isn't good?
Idk I personally didn’t like it
*sigh*

I need to start working out again ~~provided I don’t cough and wheeze~~
i haven't moved in yet but will visit campus the next 3 days kekw
:Hug:
its not good that I dont do cardio, but I hate cardio and therefore i just ignore it
how was that a good use of my time? it wasn’t but i am in the car
it's a pog piano tho
uhh i have to like, make first impressions and stuff and I suck at those
Also I don’t like Leutner
3 won’t work for me today but I’ll lyk when I’m nearby and free
Would that work for you
An hour or like 1.5 hours
mmm i don't think i can today cuz i have to pack :xCrittyx:  pressure of move-in is going up and i haven't done a good job in packing so far
don't regret it
I’m tired of packing
Why isn’t teleportation a thing
Hi tired of packing
I think it’s cuz I have an apartment to myself so I have to pack literally everything
RIP
i hate
moving
It’s the kitchen stuff that’s getting to me, I didn’t realize how much I need

Aw rip I didn’t know it wasn’t all suites

But I’m gonna be so lonely cuz all the soph stuff is south side
yeah but tbh u dont want to be on south side anyway
the fact that i have to do homework
thats terrible
all that onboarding shit
No fuck that actually
idk why they added prework to the cpr
i never had to do this
if this doesnt make the whole thing shorter than whats the point bc i feel like we did all this shit at the class
can confirm it is definitely raining rn
It’s not raining here on campus doe lol
well im 10 minutes away and its not raining anymore but i expect it to move in soon
Chris is the rain man

wtf is an amber alert
holy shit
my watch and phone were buzzing for so long
Alert goes out to let ppl know the kidnappers car
oh damn
Dumb question, but when do final billing statements come out? I dropped a class a few weeks ago and my billing statement doesn't reflect that yet. Is tuition constant, or does it depend on the classes one is taking?
Tuition doesn’t depend on the number of classes you’re taking
Damn was he cwru student?
We don’t know
Anyone on Northside that can take a goodie for me please? Today is the "block party" but i cant go out
ay uh, where can I find that module for reorientation?
ok sick there is free food
Can u choose? Can’t today or tomorrow
hm well i can bring the things you’re missing if you need it, just lmk
For anyone thats interested in coming to west side market, I'm leaving tomorrow at 10AM
Nothing against the class in particular but I signed up for too many PHED courses for me to actually take so something has to be dropped
oh fuck thats early, might just go later dude
navigator is taking forever to get to me fr fr
so we can just go separately i guess
What type of class is that? Sages?
i... don't know
i've never been either
doesn't Case have weekly shuttles to target and walmart?
If you have the rta sticker u should be able to go too
or more like a cut of meat
Then idk
I have stuff in storage that someone's supposed to bring me tomorrow
I dont know when they'll arrivr
Idk
Actually wrong email sry, the actual event doesn't list the movie for some reason.
Isn’t that tomorrow?
I’m moving in
Unfortunately that's all I can do
I don't know what tonight's movie is
I dont think you need an ethernet cord for the tv
oh idk which cod but ik it’s the xbox 360
I’ve don’t play online games it’s not like I need speedy wifi
They don’t have my case id
I dont find something called "quad" on Google maps
~~We need to buy our own lab goggles and lab coat?~~bookstore trip took care of that
Yeah I still need to go get them🤡
eye—

Good luck the bookstore is closed Saturday and Sunday
pain
okie guess we’re going monday 💀
I don't even know what I need for ochem lab, what do we need?
I don't know if I'll show up for the movie since it's a wildcard
Can I show up to Black Widow tomorrow without a blanket? I'm okay with standing but I'm worried that I'll get kicked out for blocking other people's view
Ok I had internet there
I have a towel but I'm worried about getting grass stains on it
Hey guys I don’t go to cwru but my mom did however we don’t believe her (long story) so just for kicks and giggles who do I call to confirm if someone graduated

https://case.edu/registrar/ @jarmomscion9858 anyone in this department may be able to help ?

RIP. Make it 7 pm now
RIP
Amazon wasn't able to deliver a package to Murray Hill?
Amazon dead this week
My package to the lockers was lost in transit
Eh, they gave $20 free vouchers to use at any outlet and standby for another flight which is an hour earlier
Standby is dicey tho
Overall the airline is bad
Now I'm stuck at Newark airport god knows for how long
Yh and she says if they don't go overnight, they'll give hotel then
God forbid that happens tho
I was supposed to reach 9:30 am. I've been in airport and airplane for 25 hours now
United sucks for domestic travels
United sucks for ~~domestic~~ travel
10 hours in an airport Les goo
every single time i move in i remember how much i hate it
What's worse is a 10 hour delay
That is also something I hate
It doesn’t take me more than like 10 hours to get anywhere in America
His flight from Newark to Cleveland got delayed by 9 hours though
But isn’t that also a result of it being international and longer distance
huge fucking success
hurts my pockets but idc anymore i finally understand people’s addiction to it
I went to fribley and they swiped my card and let me in
I’ve only been here for 2 days and I’ve already cooked more than I thought I would
Oh really? I didn’t see you. Who were you sitting with
im too cold :(
the maintenance request said they would fix the unit later so i guess its broken lol
i wanna be cold 💀
David, Fuad, Diego me and dunno who else
I'm busy with Math Club right now
i wanna be warm but i already went outside
2 of my suite mates own Spirited Away so we’re staying in
Also I’m dead tired
@mootdoot I agree I’m cold as shit always
it’s kinda annoying but I assume I’m also annoying for saying it’s annoying and should be grateful xd
Lame
I don’t want bug bites
that grass area
near the school of law
if you're wrong im leaving a bad google review
I won’t be able to come
just exhausted
new keyboard sorry
Lame squared
~~lazy brain is still saying no~~
tired**
and you dont have to be outside
i still dont getthis wemote
wrong reply
omg mood
The bug bites never seem to get me
rip
rip
i forgot to get some
Just don’t go outside
but bugs can enter inside
i think i have enough food to never leave for the rest of my life
bro why u sad
I'm not gonna be taking math classes at 6 AM anymore
aw maybe tomorrow
i went to plum market
and that was enough leaving
i think 8am is the earliest classes available except clinicals?
Oh, and if I miss three PHED sessions, I fail
none of the PE classes work with my schedules T_T
im still hungry
Hi still hungry
@mootdoot ay bruh I still haven’t met you
and u probs never will
dude we lived in the same building why haven't we met yet T_T
we've passed by each other
that should count i feel
I need to hear that
He didn’t mean rn jenin…
At least you tried
I dont seem to have any mosquito bites either, does that say anything about my blood or something?
Tf no it doesn’t
First of all: oof to Zhanda
Second of all: np, although I don't think it will be on for a long time
Yeah I have no idea how to do that. Perhaps tomorrow I might spend an hour or so trying to setup Heroku but if I can't make it work in that time I'm not going to try anymore
Gotta love it, I get locked out of my Github account because I entered my password wrong too many times because my Caps Lock was on 🙃
In order for Heroku to work, I will have to upload the bot token which is very dangerous, so I will have to change the repository to private
The main reason I ran the bot was to make sure the RMP wasn't broken after I updated the Python package
Lol that's what I'm using rn but then if I host it it won't have these local files and therefore can't run
@howdy_. Shouldn't you change the icon?
he has 6 more hours and 14 mins
Rip monkey
rip you showing up to literally anything
dude if I wanted howdy to come anywhere near southside I'd deadass have to put out a giant bowl of free candy and $100 costco gift cards
That would def work
Dude I'm so sorry I didn't show up! I've been so busy :((
could u find what the iclicker instructions are
someone halp I can’t find it
Sorry, I would help but I'm not in the class :/
I took it previously but we didn't have to do this iclicker nonsense so
press unsubscribe in the email, or just email them back asking to no longer be added to the list
Oh I didn’t even notice
Yikes, I guess I'm deaf then
Sorry about that
Damn
I haven't had any for almost a week anyway
I just need caffeine
Yeah ethernet I forgot the word
Are we allowed to study in the Carleton dining area?
I'm in quad how do I know where are dining areas near
Sorry?
I just don't know where are all the dining areas, I was wondering if there was a map maybe
In #going-places if anyone needs to rmbr that
Ok but how does that help we meeting up before we get lots of work and can't go out
cuz your limit for normal swipes is a weekly limit
you can literally get all your meals in one day if u want
Rush some frats, you won’t
Nahhh the shit at Carlton was IFC unless they stayed after 7

We had one rush event from 7-9 at Leutner
Damn, I should have tried that
a million kids a year die from diarrhea
i shit you not
apparently, chris has a couch in his office if you want that
What the fuck was that fact
wtf
The Office of Multicultural Affairs has the comfiest couches I stg
my fire alarm just fell off the ceiling
apparently they're Sears?
Yeah idk where they’re specifically located but if I recall correctly they’re in south side
omg
Or major straming service
I still need to sign up for Amazon prime
(I don’t)
Idk
For the first 6 months though
That’s so much work
Fair

The document isnt on canvas so idk
Apparently Apple Music is v cheap too

I hate it here
I put mine on an hour time limit
It’s too cold for him bro
85 degrees is Antarctica apparently
I legit can't keep my eyes open goodnight
Bruh there’s so much to do for bio
and im way too sleepy
oh i will
My goal is to become a ping pong legend by the end of the semester
i want there to be a person i get confused for
nah i dont have one
i'll come right after my calc class so around 12:45 provided i don't get lost
Wednesday’s are chalked for me unless I wanna wake up early as fuck to do something
tuesdays tho?
1 class
I have one class Tuesday and Thursday
AHHHHHHH but ngl the class seems chill
i'll miss you guys
If there’s still room left take 323
we dont have lab reports apparently
Zhanda is taking 323 instead of 223
Horrible idea
raunak, why aren't you a premed? You should be a doctor instead
My class load this semester will make we want to commit not alive
Math 223, Chem223, Phys122, ENGR131 :ross:
I don’t think so Priyanka
Ochem lab is literal death
minus the part where u work out
Working out is fun tho...
I understand it but at the same time I don't
shit I have to take ochem
oh no
Not anymore?
Sigh
*sigh*
I wish I could’ve majored in bme while being a pre med though
I wish it wasn’t that brutal
Sigh
Please don’t bring up neur 201 rn😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
SAME THO
Tbh you should I feel like you're cut out for it
Honestly not a bad lecturer but syllabus be scaring me
And our participation grade partly depends on how accurately we answer his questions when called on in class
Darn it I'm bad with names
i feel that
I’m bad with recognizing people through their masks
Hot take but cold showers >>
any stuff that combines CS with bio/chem is sick
honestly cold showers hit different
cold showers do hit diff
I take cold ~~showers~~ rinses in the morning to wake me up but hot showers at night
Cold showers after a workout are better than anything
i need to try this
My suite mates have been working out and I commend them because I’m exhausted atm
i really hope the heat doesn't last for much longer
Yeah I haven’t checked discord in a while kinda
It won’t. It’s Cleveland
It starts to get cold around mid/late September
oo? I might be down honestly, need to get used to wyant first tho
Nah he’s a PNM but seems interested
Omg Rober becoming a frat boi????
Hell naw it’s so far from the quad
But it's close to literally everything else
Fair
Imagine not being a teen, couldn't be me 🤡
I'm at that age where I don't want to get older already
my man is legit my suite neighbor and i didnt know this
wtf
Oh so they got rober cause they wanted some of that Colombian powder
Y’all rooms aren’t
Idk I was working with a sigma nu person the other day and apparently they’re a good frat
I still have to finish the last one for Monday
I’m also hella sleepy rn
I’m just so tired
same honestly, I was really expecting her to go over it in class instead of do case studies
it's interesting but defo doesn't help with what we're learning imo
i feel that, it's another haywood moment. i'm legit just gonna memorize the slides and hope for the best
Same. And I hope to stay on top of things. Thankfully Fribley has excellent study spots
Yeah, but he said he might not be able to do the practice a month from now when the coursework gets intense
Although when I went yesterday they were locked 🙃
AND THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE STUDYING THERE TOO SO IT KEEPS YOU ACCOUNTABLE
Today it wasn’t
U guys didn't know my age?
So probably something near north side
You still have online classes?
I have a professor that teaches two of my classes and he had an emergency surgery for a hernia and he can't walk for 1-2 weeks
The lines are short but the pasta was actually cold lol
It wasn’t for me today
I HAVENT SEEN YOU ALL DAY
idk i'm asking you
Dinner at fribley cause they haven’t been there
I’ll show up but prolly won’t eat anything
Ofc, middle eastern friends were my bad influence they took me there a couple times
Rip I mean the content is interesting so makes sense
IM SWEATING EVEN THO I SHOWERED man fuck dorm life
The beta house is hot as fuck too Priyanka
You are tho
I’m not wrong
@kaori_flute seeing you is like seeing in white mode. Hurts my eyes you’re so white
~~u know i'm kinda tanned don't you~~
ouch
Wtf
I got fucking DEEPFRIED
Oh shiz
I’m not getting enough sleep fs
Sleepy time
Jenin and I both saw each other today and didn’t say hello for fear of being wrong
Did you find a white short woman?
Don’t worry about it it was stupid
I don’t even know anymore
OH SO IT WAS YOU
I wear them to classes because fuck contacts
Because I look like pure shit in glasses
Shit
It can’t be that bad
Trust me sir it’s bad
I’m not even kidding rn
The longer one
The longer subscription
My ass should go to bed soon but my ass is not tired
I’m tired
Very tired
Was about to do a face reveal but I realized everyone has met me already
I would never do a face reveal in a group chat
prepare the eye bleach
No Moses we don’t get food from Fribley
I don’t blame her
i'm pretty sure it's now better than last year tho
SHIT
GO SLEEP WTF

Oh no I've never played
I’ll be fine nothing some ~~cocaine~~ pre-workout can’t fix
This shit is literally legal cocaine
i feel like i'm missing someone's bday
My class schedule is so fucked today
Damn, I'd had to go from quad to leutner and back again
In fairness I only have one class at 2:30 on Thursday and Tuesday
@Deleted User I’m outside your room
Wtf are you doing there?
There's nothing :zoomeyes:
isn't that in north side? bruh i dont wanna walk that much again
is anyone here in the math 223 class that switched professors last second?
That charge that to let us of the equipment idk
3 hour physics lab what the fuck man
do we still have to do the stuff on canvas?
I don't want to pay the money
I would recommend that, I think it lasts like 2 weeks
I want to die
@zackt7718 i just wanted to say, I just took a cold shower and I feel the most alive I've ever felt
and i need to study
I gave up for the day I’m so dead
I still haven’t changed😭
SAME THO, i have so many snacks b/c of her
OMG
no i studied ochem for 2 hours, which had the same effect on me mentally
i mean i looked at their rooms today and except for the AC, it isn't really that much better. given that you have to walk so much
HONESTLY BRO it would be so good if there wasn't so much broken stuff
we're legit missing an entire couch and the maintenance people said "yeah no couch for you guys"
what happened?
ohhh sick, you have dr. sri right?
You people taking an OChem class over Sri
yeah i just wish i waited
Put enough blankets and pillows out and you’ll never need a couch
it's really scary
Don’t care didn’t ask + they’re not Sri
i’ve heard from my phide big that he’s terrible 😭
I need to stop being late to class so I can sit toward the front 💀
oh ig
oh what are you now
what he said implies that he is no longer 2024 tho
Maybe he’s trying to graduate earlier now
Omg it me
Does anyone happen to know if there is a groupme for EMAE 250?
I am sick of the heat
me and a friend tried the slide cuz it looked fun ngl
Anjali and I went on the slide when upb had a similar event for the freshmen
Fair
adam and i were having this stupid competition of who would complete it first
And you lost?
Was that on the left?
Prank: I take holidays from being a lawyer *goes wrong* *wins a nobel prize anyway*
fribley ran out of gas :cursed_flushed:
Ran out of gas for their stoves?
they didn't let zhanda in
idk
i didn't know you play soccer
One of my roommates had his card break and then he couldn't use CaseCash anywhere (this was before classes started)
they said that the food that was already made is now reserved for the people already inside
and since they can't make any more food, they aren't letting any new people in
Are u still playing
so sad. i bought everything for icing and forgot the heavy cream
Ope we aren’t playing anymore
Sorry for the late reply I only get dm notifications
It hasn’t started yet
i miss
Not really
"I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm simply here to apologize. So what we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned, and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react, or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't, and for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the Internet. I want to apologize to anyone who's seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide, but most importantly, I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. They do not deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all inclusive in the world I live in. I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said, I've made a huge mistake. I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed in myself and I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."
I think summer might end sooner cause of the hurricane
That's a good thing because it'll be cooler over here but also a bad thing because hurricanes are bad

My inner toddler kicked in I couldn’t help it
Rip
Sorry for the ghost ping I typed in the wrong name 😅
don't catch me in an intro physics lab anymore
We haven't met so idk
Anyone on Southside who wants to come with me to Dave's market?
Sad
Sorry not in 325 tho
Nope
How worried are you about the class
it's an important class
it's the first assignment, it's probably nothing TOO important
I'm in the class too and idk what to expect
No idea what the exam will be like
Holy shit I sprinted for half a mile to make it for my math quiz
I’m absolutely dying right now
its by the old dental school
Those arent rta
A RACIST WOMAN TOLD ME TO GO BACK TO MY COUNTRY TODAY AND BOTH MY MOM AND I TOLD HER OFF
That is so terrible, I'm sorry you had to go through that
Because she knew she was in the wrong when it came to her racist remarks
you should have told her to go back to the toxic waste dump where she was spawned
I bet she doesn’t even know what spawn means
She say that like her ancestry ain’t from a European country lmfao
I don't get the joke
Oh
I didn't read that part lol
Honestly it feels like I never left
Bro i was shaking even though I was destroying her and deep down I was like “STOP SHIVERING”
Really came in clutch today
It's terrifying that you have to have something like that. Sometimes I wonder what would happen to me if the Indian side of me showed itself on my skin instead of my white side. My dad is brown and always gets stopped at the "random screenings" at airports, in addition to the racism that he already receives from some of his patients.
Yeah, it’s like a social fight or flight response ngl. I’m not sure if my dad has ever been stopped at the airports for screenings but ik that that both of my parents deal with racism all the time at work (both subtle and direct)
OMG
If I need to order a product that isn't available on Amazon, where do I ship it to? My dorm?

I’m bored as well
Did you finish 281 homework?
How r u bored? What
Oh right, IDK why I thought you're in that class lol
oh i still have to do that
i meant as in studying
General suitemates. Everyone is active and timings match. Sometimes going out for food or movie like Shang-Chi. Lot of interactions so I don't get bored
also i dont like falafel
damn
wtf there's more food and you guys didn't knock on my door 🥺
It was only 5/6 people eating tho
Lol I find that doing schoolwork keeps me preoccupied from worrying about FOMO
i'm so tired already i don't wanna go to the SI session
Then *don't*
cuz i just got held back from luxurious rest:wobble:
Lol I find that fomo keeps me preoccupied from worrying about doing schoolwork
Half of the people in my apartment have gotten locked out already
What do we win tho
i think he "doxxed" someone but not really
Anyone needs a ride to NYC/Long Island area next weekend? I'm looking for maximum 2 passengers to potentially split the traveling cost
I don't mind charging anywhere between 250-500, cheaper than a round-trip to jfk. Gonna be a 2hr flight
I'll be leaving on either Friday or Thursday
is it just me or is the wifi really slow rn
like on ur own plane
I don't own the plane but u get the idea
damn I would it seems fun but CLE to jfk flights are like 150 xd
actually now that I think about it I probably have a shit ton of shit to do next weekend like every weekend
$250 is *really* pushing it
Insta doesn't work at all
not even sure if net neutrality covers that? cwru technically isnt an isp right?
also, can't you unthrottle it as the utech god @howdy_. ?
Can someone help evaluate this limit? I’m not allowed to use L’Hospital’s Rule and all I’m supposed to do is rationalize the numerator but I’ve been stuck on it for the past 10 hours
Any luck @moseslee? I tried it but I'm stuck at lim x->0 [✓(x+1)-x-1]/x. Been a few years since I did calc 1 and 2
You might have to approach the limit from the left and right
damn I really spent
3 hours of my day at the hospital
fml
np np, lmk if any of the steps didn't make sense
ok update
someone in the engineering server said that it was an armed robbery outside house 7
and someone in stj said that there was a ruckus outside
apparently it was some dude in his underwear
Oh yikes
I didn't know
Nope
Wtf
ok so apparently
Wtf
they're looking for suspects, so either they didn't catch the first dude
Jesus fucking Christ
yeah it's scary
This isnt the inner city :thonk:
Like a mile away @_frostyyyyy_ @Deleted User
Possibly on campus idk
If someone got shot on campus then we would have all gotten a text
Maybe it wasn't on campus, because if it was we would have all been notified as they are required to by law
sorry no clue :((
Not sure if they're open/do testing on Sunday tho
there’s literally nothing
Sorry idk then
is case getting ddosed or something? casewireless keeps randomly going online and offline
@_frostyyyyy_ bro you gotta stop im studying bio 😭
Is it a good idea to take a flight back home on Dec 14th, a day after my last final? After finishing finals, there's nothing left, right?
24 hours after the last final max
Oswin, you're leaving. Y
Leaving on dec 14th to go home
😢 . What will I do alone if I stay here
idk, is it possible to get a flight home?
Pain
I hate airports
Nvm, I'm not alone. Some suitemates will stay
nope nvm
no one of them was a woman so they can't all be the same
Also why would you run after the 3 (possibly 4) people who just robbed you at gunpoint? Just doesn't sound like a good idea imo
he wanted his shit back
u dont just take someones shit without expecting retaliation
this mans was awake at 5 AM
I went to sleep at 11:40 PM but woke up to my phone vibrating because of the AMBER alert, I'm surprised since I'm a heavy sleeper but a phone vibrating woke me up
I went back to sleep immediately and got out of bed at 7:30
Well no wonder I woke up twice cause that alarm rings full volume on my phone idk why
did not even feel it
Does anyone know how much of the book material comes in exams of class COSI 325?
I’m in the class now so obv I don’t know what’s gonna happen on the first test yet either, but considering that she said she covered all the main points from the readings on the quizzes and lecture, I’m only gonna reread the key points from the book and hope that’s good enough
Has anyone taken USSY 292G Pls dm me
if u arent launching icbms i dont want it
He gave this exam from a 1993 text book. Wtf
No, it wasn't in our exam tho
I dont think the SIs went over any capacitor problems either
im very grumpy and very bored
Im sorry 😓
Yooo sick!!
kinda hard to miss
RIP 😭😭😭😭😭
It’s cause they used the energy equation for a capacitor
Oh but again when did the SIs or teacher even cover that damn eqn
They didn't even put the hint assume as conductor or so
rip
Yeah it’s stupid
But I understand it now. Wish I had that in my cheat sheet tho
Yeah duh bubbles are conductors isn't that common knowledge? smh
don't sass me
it should be that everyone got tested last week
and like I saw someone posting about wade commons and I was like wtf how do the fuck do they know about wade commons
uh oh
With like "u wish"
idk
why arent there sophomores in the village 🤔
Are there any places on campus where I can talk to someone else in a room without interruptions or noise? It doesn't need to be a big room
The study rooms in our suite are quiet and empty all time
study room in suite?
There are group study rooms and conference rooms in the building but not in the suite
Unfortunately I have to show up with at least one other person and I want to talk to someone over the Internet and not in-person so that won't work. I saw this on their website:

> I understand that if I do not arrive within the first 15 minutes of my scheduled time with a second group member, the room reservation will be lifted and made available to other groups.
oh nvm
yeahhh ksl/campus doesn't really have private rooms like that but
what i can say is that deep in the 3rd floor ksl stacks are those little study cubbies so potentially you could find a corner with no one around and that would be pretty quiet
@_frostyyyyy_ I got a table at  ksl and the person I went with waited like 20 mins for me and they didn't tell her anything
Chill, but you don't really need a room then just go to third floor that's fine
Any study room in the village any room on Sears 4th or 5th floor nord computer lab any room in white
Oops wrong reply
I thought you fixed your sleep schedule
Is anyone taking econ 102 with prof ernest here? Or took it before?
how do magnets work
Like we work Oswin
math makes brain hurt
using Kolmogorov's 4th axiom, prove that the probability that Howdy's brain hurts from math is >= probability of the union of a random passerby knowing Howdy's real name
Cuz it is accurate to what was happening
Shame
And ran outside
Oh yeah I was in Alumni when that happened
I'm always up late
Stop studying
these mechanisms aren’t gonna write themselves
Can’t relate :fingerguns:
I remember also staying up until 3 AM working on Linear Algebra homework that was due in the morning
3/5 of the washing machines in my building are out of order and one of them that had my laundry broke before my eyes
NOOOo this is so sad
a mad man
Me who took the easier Lin Alg class 🤡
Damn I did laundry just two days ago, and had no clothes left, got lucky
oh I figured it out
I took matlab and I passed by looking at the documentation
System fail 😭
everybody else was absolutely killing though
Oh god never again man
I just wish they had them changes as an option
Ah man I couldn’t come. Next time probably
I don't allow #sorrynotsorry
Come on I wasn’t that bad
I need, well not need but have a deep dark desire, to make bread
anyone want to spectate the disaster
chris if u want
i couldn’t bring myself to get out of bed so i didn’t have enough time to shower
tomorrow is gonna be worse because i have an 8:15 lab
i hate this shit
Don't worry everyone looks bad at ochem lab because nobody wants to be htere
this shit is not fun and I will not gaslight myself into believing it is
anything can be fun, never physics tho
Yeah probably, u just need the answer pdf?
does anyone want tomato sauce
mayhaps ;)  
(im working during these sessions, and it sucks)
not me having to miss some of them for another program
anyone else having tons of internet issues today
i still havent done them
i dont know i havent done them either
So you didn't get lunch then?
lollll rip
Nope lol I went and the door was locked
this is so sad
rip
So you ordered your food and you couldn't get it
The door was locked? The door to the entire building? I'm surprised since I thought it was only the food area downstairs that closed at 3
idk if they'd had thrown away your food by now tho :")
Oh gotcha
Phone really
oh
i procrastinated replying and forgot to reply :LAUGH:
The inside or the outside
the inside
Something could be burning but idk

Protip, watch this instead of studying for bio
@zacharious took it last year, you can ask him what’s important
Well me and Raunak did take it last year but diff prof
Oh you took it?
I thought only robinovich taught last semester:0
Ayday taught it last fall and Misha taught it last spring
Unfortunately I was smol brain on the midterm cause I didn’t know how to solve the Big O problems
But I heard ayday didn’t put emphasis on Big O this sem so…idk?
Would it be a bad idea to take CSDS 233 and 281 at the same time
281 is a joke of a class
I heard it's harder than online because there's actually exams this time but I heard it's still a chill clas
Yeah 281 isn’t bad
Uh oh
Oh shit did u take it?
same shit
uh oh
But the test was so long I didn't have time to go back
What I meant to say is that he didn’t even cover it in depth(from what I’ve been told)
Idk how you learn Data Structures without covering Big-O in-depth
Idk maybe the guy I heard this from is just not paying enough attention in class and has no idea what’s going on lol
I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145 I hate engr 145

Anyone want to go bowling in like 2 hours? My friend are looking for several more people
Does anyone know if air fryers are allowed in the dorms?
I don't think so, but if you're careful and don't set off the fire alarm they would probably never know
I had plans for tomorrow and didn’t want to wait for the next calendar year
I forgot how slow subway is
Someone took ur food thwn

Staley has lost all hot water for the foreseeable future
Can we get a C in chat for all the cold showers I’m gonna have to take
what happened?
i can’t take 2 required sociology courses because of ochem lab

There’s a part missing and they don’t have it

Very cold
Moving in to Raunak’s suite as we speak
I have 6 in my room alone
she’s legitimately the best and i’ve never felt so validated by someone in my life
i had a bad experience with elizabeth garrett and im scared to go back to her💀 
are we allowed to request certain counselors?
Yeah. They won’t make you see someone you don’t feel comfortable with.

So is Southside Scholar good? Haven't been there yet
But still
it's not that it's an unpopular opinion
it's just wrong
It's wrong that he's a bitch 😢
Heads up: the fries in Fribley are bad. One of my suitemates and one of my other friends are at the toilet throwing up right now.
How did they even accomplish making a potato bad
mhm case should’ve paid for my hospital bill too but here we are 😐
how did fribley manage to outdo leutner in terms of bad food 💀
Hey are any of y'all drummers or know any drummers? Some friends and I are trying to play some music together and we have everyone except a drummer. Mostly rock, probably leaning in the prog direction, but it's very chill and we're just trying to have fun. Def open to lots of different music tho. feel free to DM me, sometimes I miss notifs here
i dont think its the fries
Is the nursing research building still in the same place where it used to be (over by the BRB)?
my mom says it's tomorrow for some reason
I’m not mentally prepared for next semester even though I’m taking less credits
so many math classes :nkowuahvomit:
math
i don't have fun when grades are dying
307 is kinda hard
Math is fun. I'm looking forward to finishing off my last math course diff eq next sem
fax tho
I finished math last semester, take diff with Troy
I heard someone screamed stuff during the class
Is thinkham closed at one point?
It's confusing since it says it closes at 11 but you can get in 24/7?
you can’t rent meeting rooms past 11 pm
I've been at tink till 2 am some nights. They close the conference rooms and all the staff go home but the building is open.
Nice, and the printer should still work right?
But knowing wepa printers, those things decide when they wanna work
If anyone has taken any of these, how was it?
im a freshman so idk which is better
From what I heard STAT312 isn't that hard if you take it with Danhong Song but that class is full already
Mostly self study, depends entirely on what Professor you get though (Stat 312)
class isnt too hard tho
do i need to form my schedule and then get my advisor to approve
my previous advisor just removed it without me having to do anything
My advisor already knew I was organized enough and released the hold without a meeting
i cant find a list anywhere
this is for my math major
it depends on which type of math major you are
im a BS in math
i'm trying to find that
that doesnt tell me what the classes are tho
I would try asking your advisor. I would assume that most math classes would count
scary
You (or someone else) should reserve me a seat :D (if you can? idk how it works)
what class do you need reserved?
all the classes i wanted to take are in the 1-2:15 timeslot, which is hell, why is every class at that time
All the other classes that I wanted got full
@spirit5oul u need a class?
for math i realized i should be good, i have kosloff right now for calc 3 so i can probably just talk to him after class tomorrow
idk if it will let me if i have a class conflict
naw it wont let me
this is so sad, ty for the effort
dont act like yall dont know nurses were the mean girls in high school
Someone suggest me a class to take
i aint never taken a class that meets thrice a week
take math 444 w/ me
Math 444 as Zach said
someone already recommended that to me so yea i'm taking it
i would but i'm too stupid for that class
My stats class has 3 seats open
Wtf
I don't want to take 313. That's hard plus it clashes with class
i don't have to take that class
Sorry?
not teaching this semester it seems
there's nothing open rip
priyanka you don't have to laugh at my pain
Your pain is enjoyable:smug:
Oh it wasn't just a week
It keeps breaking
don't lie i don't see you cackling
Its better for him because when its broken I'm using his shower
i could be crying
nth, just lonely here

sophomore cs majors trying to get classes
cause im american
imo nah, not "easy" but definitely very possible. quizzes are 35% of the grade and are not exactly hard but not exactly easy either. homework usually takes like ~3 hours. weekly labs but those are usually pretty easy. questions on them can sometimes be hard. we haven't taken the final yet but i believe its also 35%. he drops 2 quizzes and 2 homeworks. if u just do everything and show up to lectures and make sure u understand everything you'll probably get an A
in class quizes tho
hate the quizzes lmao
are you also lost this week howdy?
i didn't get the homework AT all
i've been lost all weeks
pain
better than 122 tho
they basically explain the week's content, what's gonna be on the quiz, and also give practice problems (which are usually like the quiz)
tho
if u took away the quizes, this class would b perfectly fine
say u messed up a node voltage they would take off 0.5 for like one point being wrong
not like some professors were they would take off point for the thing being wrong, then take off point for the value being wrong (since you used the incorrect value) if u know what i mean
thats fair
everytime im like "yeah im gonna study and do better on the next one" then it never happens lmao
also the homework is due 9:30 am on wednesdays, and you usally can't do all of it without monday's lecture, so make sure to try and do it in advance
someone in my sages class (im in a first year seminar rn) is an english major tho lol
no, i mean the class code
oh wh
oh i think its sy
well, u cant take any more sy's and anymore FS, you'd want to look at USNA, or USSO
oh ic
dont switch to compe, the advisor is terrible
never responds to email
cuz he doesnt attend his own office hours
She explains stuff well
And is very helpful in office hours 
And the subject in general is easy ~~no, I’m not lost in it atm~~
that sucks sorry
we couldnt decide between ee or cs, so we decided to make a bastard child :P
I haven’t looked at the written part at all :cursed_flushed:
Yea
I’m still confused about some stuff tho 
Cuz I still don’t understand hashing 🤡
You basically need to build your own hash table 
You can’t use the libarary for pre existing classes
yea, i think he wants a linked list?
cuz i thought we just had a final left
As in 
You can’t use built-in hash table/ linked list/array list
You want to to implement separate chaining
I’m not able to pay attention in class anymore 😭
you were able to to begin with?
That’s not the case anymore
I think I got into everything but I really can't tell lol
Yessss I got everything, even the 1 person class
did anyone here get the ochem lab 2 monday 2:15-5:15
anyone someone
What an absolute shit show this has been
I still need two more classes
Did you get what you wanted?
What I wanted got filled up 2 days back so no
I got in some really shitty cs classes that I’m not even interested in
Idk why everyone is avoiding compiler design
4 of my classes filled up 20 mins after
Please I need that lab time
Not Monday mb
rip lab
I guess Wednesday could work for me but don’t wanna spend Fridays working on my lab report
don't talk to me on mondays and wednesday pls ty
I pray someone drops Monday ochem lab 2
computer architecture 
couldn't make it into OS T_T
CSDS 391: AI and MATH 444: Math of Data Mining
i anticipate your death very soon
@Deleted User . He said the labs were such a pain
It’s only a pain when you transition directly into in person classes
Having to synthesize a compound without knowing how to do a vacuum filtration is hell
You had some other instructor tho. Ours is a god apparently
Dude this is legit something you can’t say yet lol
You need to motivate us Oswin
Experiments 2-9 are pretty easy imo, it’s just experiment 1 that sucks
OS still has a seat open and even if it closes soon, Loui will accept a permission request
it's either OS or architevture
im open to someone dropping the monday ochem lab 2
yea, y'all will have experience tho which should make it not that bad
i hope someone dropssssssssss
defo someone will within a month or so
i feel that for phys 116 tho
swear that class filled up so fast
i don't have a physics C credit sadly, school didn't offer it
oh
Don't drop just yet
2 of them are hella hard, so i'll defo need to drop something
omg lucky
how hard can that be?
and moving electrons
doin some charity work
that's just accounting work
isn't that why all BMEs are business majors eventually?
why does a subject involving moving electrons have to be so rough
why does a subject about [hard subject] have to be so hard
at least math is so easy
you just work with numbers and variables
math is so overhyped
I'm taking 4 rn and it's not too bad except when they all have quizzes and exams in the same week and then I'm miserable for that week. I'm planning to take 4 next semester too
My lowest grade right now is SAGES by far so I don't mind taking more STEM
Someone please pray for me
I'm scared
Don't take statics if you don't need to
I'd rather have two stem classes than one annoying sages class
I just realized that Psychology and Sociology fit my breath requirements so I don't need to take ENGR 200 and can take it later
Bro, what a steal? That means I'm 129 credits being BME on pre-med track lol without IB creds
I probably didn't even need to rush OChem in the summer. wtf
uhh apparently a 5 year old
what the car looks like btw, if you happen to notice it
will keep eye out
Are we a Discord school hub yet?
Imperial system be like 5.1847 * 10^69 iPhone 10 flashlights (exactly)
It's been 4 years and people still can't get the iPhone X's name right in writing or speech
It's either iPhone 10 or iPhone ex
This is the first one where they actually tried
I think most people who want an Android phone should get a Galaxy or Pixel
didn't think it was real until I looked it up
I'm not in that class
I hate this class
If it's so, then I hope Apple falls apart before they release the iPhone 30
or the iphone 509
damn what a flex @_frostyyyyy_
and this is why i will never get linkedin
dont need people knowing my academics or stalking my profile
ain't this always
That was because Ansh didn't believe me when I told him you're doing research so I had to show him your profile
Oh I'm not really but I'm in a lab
oh
y'all popping off with your linkedin accounts and meanwhile i don't even have a profile picture 💀
Oswin needs no profile picture
also damn i didnt know oswin was from nebraska...
Trust me my LinkedIn needs some updating
pain
bro i don't even have my research position on my linkedin and it's been a year lmao
when your advisor never responds to your emails so you email the person in-charge of changing your advisor to assign you a new one, but they also don't respond to your email
It ended with cliffhanger tho
I forgot
Nothing on campus is open 💀
I don’t use my refrigerator
if you need a yogurt go get one
I want you 🥵
Jolly/south side scholar isn’t listed. Do you know about them
I've been saving my CaseCash all semester (only used 40 dollars), I guess I'll spend it all during Thanksgiving week
But everything will be closed so where will you use it
I'm not worried about Thanksgiving day too much since I won't be on campus, I'm just looking for where to get breakfast and lunch on the days surrounding Thanksgiving
i'm vegetarian tho
Yeah lol, like are we supposed to do a one meal a day diet for a few days? It isn't until Monday that Leutner opens earlier than 4:30 PM
Just a suggestion, idk
Jolly closed yesterday for the break
I'm not using my portable up that quickly since Plum has Thanksgiving meals today, Friday, and Saturday
Well I'm leaving today so 😂
In fact I'm in a car right now
Are any restaurants on Euclid or any place near campus gonna be open tomorrow?
Ik Bibibop and burger im are closed tomorrow
some places don't update their timings on google so you may want to call the ones you'd wanna eat at
True, I called Chopstick which isn't listed on Google as closed tomorrow but they told me that they're not open tomorrow
Damn @zacharious how you doin?
did something happen? 👀
Yeah he left our suite😔
As in left for Thanksgiving or for good?
Im tired of their B's
You left us too 😔
Sorry man Lucas was just way too good at hitting the falsetto I just couldn’t compete 😔
Can’t believe my role model Elmo is disappointed in me too 😔
RIP
y'all left cleveland on the right time
Going home made me remember how little I wanted to be home :cri:
Ikr I’m so sleepy
it feels like a saturday
im too anxious to do that cuz of ✨finals season✨
it feels like depresso day
Why so early sir
Is that a staple? How would that even happen?!?!
cause with dates u need to count each number seperately
do you guys want an updated barbara snyder as the server icon?
"Physical recovery: six weeks. Full psychological recovery: six months." Sherlock Holmes
guys we need to cancel dhananjay
if you want a higher quality thing lmk
@howdy_. can u change the icon im not w my laptop rn
Does meal plan CaseCash carry over to the next semester if I didn't spend it this semester? I heard that it might not so I just want to check
Damn what if omicron's mutations are just covid dressing up for Christmas 👀
oh shit you might be right
is there any way. to get into thinkbox even tho it is closed
does anyone work there. i need to make buttons
Also wtf leutner music today was just r&b, I feel like I'm in a date
We really have finals next week bruh
Lol don't want to do AI?
No I do, but this is a more specialized AI class. It's a depth class
Interestingly, it's not even listed as a CS class, it's only an ECSE class
If you want, I can give it to you. It's indie design
Wish!
If we assume david’s head to be spherical, what’s the charge outside? 😉
outside outside? Or in the common room?
oh nvm he’s back in
***PAIN DOES NOT EXIST***
but looking  at the approaching phys test says otherwise
not me going to the wrong place for the exam
I can't tell if you spelt this wrong on purpose
wherever you find them
Wtf does u mean
How many swipes do I have left?
It just says uuuu for everything
That means you have the unlimited meal plan so you can't run out of swipes
My bad
if I don't, my mom is going to see it
Don't move it
Also @quintus_fabius_ I'm just shocked you got the website working
Mine already got graded yesterday
I GOT AN A IN PHYSICS THIS ISNT GOOD TIMING BUT I NEED TO ANNOUNCE IT
Yeah wtf is that about????
thank u, very poor timing ik
not the Java TA's having nothing done and realizing final grades are due tomorrow
It doesn't help that people's projects don't work
Tho I think he would have rounded without curve also. Whatevs
Barely understood shit from his teaching
also my calc 3 class still has nothing graded
RIP
And also wtf is that announcement
The person involved should probably report that to the school. Otherwise there’s always the possibility the abuser can do it again.
Damn I only needed like a 67 for a B in the class on the final
Fuck I kinda wish I knew that beforehand I would have studied a little harder because an A was still technically possible at only an 88
Essex County, close to Patterson
I was like *I don’t belong here 👀*
I’ve seen so many ads about stores in Edison NJ show up on Indian tv and my 7-year-old Ohioan ass is sitting there like how am I supposed to visit your store😐
Correction: if you don't have a car, rite aid will not let you get a test but cvs will. You have to stand in the drive thru line (dont ask me how I know)
I needed a PCR, however, so idk about rapid

Cleveland, OH 44106-2676
I haven't really checked this server until I saw Dhananjay
Oh lmaoooo
Can’t turn down free tendies 🥺
Maybe it is my body, telling me that 19 hours of constant moving followed by 5 hours of quality sleep is not good for me
+ i had a neg covid test too so it isnt that
I need to show off my mechanical engineering monkey brain
bruh isn't hilary hahn the famous violinist
Lol that isn't directed towards me
Damn what are the odds of playing against him 😍
But damn he did make short work of you
Yeah it wasn't even close, I was still starstruck from getting matched to him
Last time I tried this is backfired
I was trying to figure that out too, there is a 114th street that is right across the railroad from thinkbox but other than that it is a mystery
Won’t this time
Yeah i tried looking too, can’t find it
you’d go through the office of equity
idk how to do it but the original email that stated that case now requires the booster tells u how
For students, the policy is to visit the Office of Equity for religious exemptions and the Office of Disability Resources for medical exemptions
If you’re not able to get one because you’re abroad Raunak you can still come onto campus after January 3rd as long as you document proof of a booster shot before January the 7th
Nah I need a medical exemption
I’ll contact the office of disability resources
Should I still update my vaccine card picture in my health connect even if I got a booster on campus?
@howdy_. normally I would cancel you for speaking about the wrong time zone but now that I've been adopted by east TN I cant
adam you go to an EST college
Facts the liberal media doesn’t want you to know about
not that i would ever defend pst, but if you really think about it pst gets to hold onto christmas the longest
y'all be like "boo hoo boo hoo xmas is over" pst be like :smug:
make @zacharious cry
Coastal elites know nothing about they joys of going fishing fr
Coastal elites don't finish smh
kidz kidz kidz it's 3 hours

That's lame tho
Never seen a banana wear jeans 🧐
haven't you seen the bananas at leutner?
God I can’t wait for someone to read my messages these last 20 minutes and think I’m MAGA 🤣🤣🤣
They don’t make applesauce like they used to
Omg
zhanda yesterday on cam 
except he got closer to cam
this is the second time this happened this week
yeah lol, if i was getting mugged by 5'4" 15-16 year old i would give him the keys to a toy car
Maybe he only wanted to practice is driving 😢
hi people i got accepted c/o 2026 but i can't find the 2025 discord server i hope u guys dont mind me joining here to ask questions
Bro this is like the 30th time we scared an underclassmen away
I feel old
And the first quarter of our time here wasnt even real
The years passed by so fast 🥲
Dont panic about the emergency alert guys it was just @chandachan going wild to celebrate
@nobelium19 Maybe they only wanted to practice driving 🥲
Wtf is happening. Also where tf is this happening?
Good news: not really close to where most people would walk, south side wise
Bad news: This is the first time where somebody actually sustained a gunshot wound I believe
That’s scary af
im tired of this, i pass through little italy with a brick in my hand for these motherfuckers just in case
@nobelium19 looks like he did want to practice driving after all
They had basically the same description except one was 12-15 and one was 15-16
Hey! Are there any other Case Discord servers that anyone would recommend joining? I can’t seem to find any other one’s online
rip Betty white
rip
Yo can we get rid of the santa hat on the server icon now that Christmas is over? I know it's sad but
Howdy still has a santa pfp so I doubt it
Icon will change when i get to my pc
Are there still in person clubs and other events during the two online weeks
If your clubs got cancelled you can still get an amateur radio technician licence in less than 2 weeks of studying
nope
i passed the test twice 💯💯
I passed the test 0 times
@chandachan ur bestie is gone 😦
Idk at this point
So many people are shot but this is far from campus right
Oh nvm. 118th st so three blocks away
Wtf
At this point I'm about to get shot up trying to walk to mitchells
Naa. Bad timing Zhanda
How did y’all stay sane last year
We didn’t
Basically last year the only social interaction you got was either from eating together or none
Unless you wanted to break the rules 😂
That would be fine but it’s cold man
This winter has been pretty hot so far but it’s usually so snowy and cold
Is that going to happen again this year?
I don’t really see the point of online classes for the first 2 weeks because of we’re really honest most of the spreading is coming from social gatherings (not that I want them to restrict that too)
No, I was just telling him what happened last year
I'm just worried that's going to happen again
I think the worst case scenario is that they might extend the online classes to a month or something until the cases die down
This winter is supposed to be bad soon
They aren't???
I don't believe so
"In addition, you will be required to take a COVID-19 test each week for three weeks, wear masks indoors, and refrain from social gatherings for at least two weeks."

idk if this counts as restricting but they clearly have a position on it
Nvm that is basically like last year
Because otherwise they lose room and board money
Fair enough, I guess they can’t afford to take another hit like that
Or maybe they can, and they just don’t want to😂
But to be fair I also thought that we would go back online last semester, so I'm probably a pessimist
We can take bets on when that’ll happen if you want
The university is essentially a business. Regardless of whether they can take a hit or not, they want to maximize their revenue and minimize their costs
My guess is we’ll have online classes till February judging by the outbreaks in other countries but it’ll probably be longer
I don't think we will be sent home but it might be online for the whole semester
but sadly i had to drop genetics 🥲  hopefully dr. crown teaches this course again in the future
they would rather have more buildings for isolation than sending us back home
What about tink and ksl tho?
last year, tables were like 1-2 people per table
i've heard of it other places but i havent seen like an actual case thing
oh
the admin needs to stop buying yachts
like where does our money go
This shit exists?
I lost my original card so now I only have a printout of the dose I got
Oh I found instructions nvm
gotcha, i tried that and my file is too big 🥲
it compressed and looked just fine but it still says the file is larger than 4 MB when i compressed it to 2.7 MB
Oh weird
don't lose your covid vaccine card kids
Can't lose your covid vaccine card if you don't get vaccinated :fingerguns:
yeah holy shit
I just opened up a Roth IRA! No idea what I'm doing but it's never a bad time to learn
you know you're planning ahead when you open an IRA without having a full time job yet
Omg
My flight
oh
Ah no I was wrong
This entire plane is just case people
Yep same plane
At least it isn't spirit
fair
I must have taken that picture but for some reason I don't remember
If I stuck my head into an igloo and I saw adam staring back at me I might just have an aneurism and die
Nobel are you in cleveland yet
I admire your confidence in it not collapsing on your head
I guess this is what you get from being a MechE major
They're gonna die
Oh prolly
it would spray powder on everything and be super hard to clean up, dont ask me how i know
Unfortunately, I do not
If you want to be added on there, hmu 🤣
he keeps it in his office
looks like you are going to the office then
I don't remember, but probably tomorrow
at least we don't have to leave a million years early to reach one day before the drivers
also sunday is early for me given that my parents wanted me to stay home for 2 more weeks
damn wtfff
All of my earliest classes are far away
Catch me huffing and puffing from Mather quad to AW Smith on MWF 😭
I guess it isn't that bad
no not really
obv don't go there at night
alone
Don't drive a car through the shortcut
bruh my class locations are wack this semester
White wasn't bad
The lecture hall in 411 is cold year round
^^ Plus OS was in there and that class wasn't fun
cuz im a hacker and a stalker
i will greatly miss fu-sen
I plain forgot everything in ochem
Oh crap I have AI in that bldg
i will also miss dr. silver @nobelium19
what a g, he dropped the last exam
Yeah I looked at the syllabus and it doesn't look very easy
Otherwise I'm dead
PSCL101 didn't fit 😅
i wish i could still take genetics 🥲
what psych class is that?
i took my j term class with him last year
I don't mind tests if they are:
1. Straightforward
2. Not stressful
3. Easy to study for

In other words I hate tests
i miss baeslack
No
CSDS is computer science and data science
Sorry I meant to reply to Nobelium
In my room half dead
Except for Nobel lol
And tired
I also need to clean my room
You might have to call the help desk. I remember reading on Canvas that that is what you’re supposed to do, but I could be wrong
I can’t even change it myself?
I don't think it's possible to remove the duo authentication
Yeah but I just want to change the authentication method
Can’t you usually decide on the spot?
Kinda need to change it
by default whenever you need to login to something that requires duo authentication
I didn’t set the other ones up tho
Idk where to go to set them up
I tried
Shit ain’t really bring up anything useful
That should work
If you need to download the tb, use libgen
I read through all of the relevant material for the class and it was definitely useful but you don't need to read it. However, if your professor is Xu (and he is since he's the only one teaching it this semester), then your homework will be from the book so you need it
I missed me first class
i woke up for it and fell back asleep
Even though last time I checked Alexa, it was 9 am and then 10:30 when I checked next
My professor today forgot to turn off her eyebrow filter on zoom so she had these fake eyebrows flying around the screen the whole class
Sorry, our f(t,y) function is y'
That's some multiverse shit
Oh shit
False alarm guys: The aid is disbursing rn so won't appear for some time
wtf, I'm scared
I cry @sprinkles2108
Lol someone told me about this, what class was it?
RIP
She really wasn’t that bad, but she didn’t do any explaining, the TA’s did instead
I'm guessing that Ray won't test you on intricate knowledge of Java features like lambdas, generics, etc. I think that the main difficulty is that he apparently made his own Java API so you know how to use that well
Yeah you're probably right but if you AP 132 not only are you missing out on Java concepts but Connamacher teaches a lot of pretty important coding concepts as well
i could never
how was the class?
Never
Not even finals 😃
lmao, we have a life-happens pass for missing QOTD. Goated teacher Rita Obeid
I had a final scheduled at 8am for this sem and yesterday the professor told us that he doesn’t like waking up so he changed it to 9am and made the exam an hour shorter
Even better than that: no exams
3 hours extra sleep
Umm I forgot lol. I think it was databases with ozguner
He did the same thing with Algorithms last semester
He said that he knows CS majors don't like to wake up that early
if i sleep at 4, no way on hell i'd want to wake up at 8
ahaha it's true tho
Should I take math 380 before csds 391
i've heard some ppl do well w/o but they're math majors with a strong stats background
dude this class is so boring
good god this is worse than last year
aparently the most boring lecture ever
What class
Which class?
Unfortunate i dont have a clicker @gimmegimm
i dont think anyone here has one, we just did canvas quizzes instead
Thought that didn't look like a dorm bed 😂
140 positive cases on campus as of monday 👀
Yeah maybe the online semester will last longer than 2 weeks 😭
online school at home<<<
fair enough
nah cuz I be taking my mask off to cough on every public space I go to
I just registered for a class today. The class starts in an hour and I don't have any link or anything to join the zoom
euclid chipotle tho, oof
near Dave's
screw that I ain't walking all the way to south side
fair, but south side chipotle is living in the year 3000
euclid chipotle on some stone age type shit
Fair
sorry besties i have to disagree
northside just seems foreign to me (probs cuz i didn't live there last year)
southside sux for everything except maybe dave’s distance and food distance
oh rip
worse case take the rta 😭
rta is chill but i’m scared since it’s big
also i sit far away from everyone when i can
usually im at least a seat away from someone
fair enough
cant believe first semester i had no clue that either existed. i literally would walk all the way to rite aid everytime i needed snacks or anything
omg
i feel like OSU columbus is scarier than where we are on campus
really?
but i wouldn't be surprised if it's really sketch
parking will suck 😭
Who doesn’t love getting mugged at 12:30 at night
Dog :naenae:
I think they have "open swim" hours or something posted either on their website or inside veale
@howdy_. He said that the queen's breath is way too hot and that she needs some Listerine
left
and then 5 minutes later someone got shot in the head in an alley right next to it
she called me bawling her eyes out was scary 😃
Jet lag sucks
Oh
Idk
That is so scary
Do it u won’t
oh that was me sorry
I play piano sorry
bass hurts my fingers
sorry i don't play bass and i'm in my own band anyway
No class Monday right?
Just pinging this again in case people didn't see it
Rip
oh
holy shit you got me for a sec
ok someone needs to explain to me what the fuck an honor society is and why anyone would join because i still dont get it
It’s like a secret society where all the members do math problems
It really feels like a scam to me, $110? Seriously?
that isnt even true though as far as i can tell they do nothing
are there just no benefits tho
it dont make sense
shit kahler has covid
that's not the worst part of his email
yes but transcription isn't the right thing to nerd on
Yeaaaaaa but still
isn't ford on adelbert?
we went to southside scholar
@addat tendies run is approaching but the den is closed wydwydwyd
This is actually my last SAGES, I was just checking when a friend's SAGES ended 😂
why were there shirtless men running outside Tippit wearing nothing but shorts
It’s scary how professors can memorize your name o.o
stupid question, but I’m in this physics lab section and I’m not sure which weeks I’m even supposed to go to lab… I asked a TA to clarify and his answer was literally “yes.” Could anyone help me out?
no i went both weeks but i had no clue what to do afterwards lol
Oh lol I was worried too
Like I knew I'm on even weeks but I was wondering "what if I'm actually supposed to show up this week and I just calculated it wrong" lol
Also the TA just saying "yes" is horrible
But still cat!
they’re not unfortunately
mine is supposed to b in person tmrw and my therapist hasnt said anything yet so idk
that could be a mistake, that’s happened to me before
i did but they wont respond till tomorrow. thank you though :)
:) anytime—i’m sorry about that, it’s so confusing :(
when it happened to me they made it seem like it was my fault for showing up so 💀💀
what do I do if I signed up for the career fair but have classes during almost the whole thing?
Last year a lot of people skipped classes for the career fair
If you really want, you can try to email the recruiter that you wanted to talk to them?
I hate biology I genuinely don’t care about Charles Darwin’s fucking life story
pay attention in class smh
Ah man that sucks. My mom gonna be stuck at the airport now lol
does anyone want to have a snowball fight tomorrow?
AW smith building, 3rd floor
But it’s for office hours and that room was already booked
But honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if all the buildings closed early because of the snow
bruh the bader test today was so fucking ass
Is biol 214 a weedout class because of the sheer stupidity of the whole fucking course????????
That class… was a roller coaster
And the final… don’t even get me STARTED
He made 300 people hate flamingos😭
She forgot her own birthday 😂
campus closed tomorrow
No school x2
I pray my ochem exam gets moved

edit: it got moved😎
Extra time to study
Does that mean you have 3 exams on Wednesday?
I really want to go to a midnight screening of that at some point
Though one Monday is a quiz
Imagine taking the hard ochem @nobelium19
I don't have a comeback to that unfortunately
Also guys go out stf some fat ass snowflakes
so guess who needs to see a neurologist and an orthopedist for her spinal column and spinal cord😁
Rip, hope its nothing major
omg
ugh imma be rich 👁
Hey don't make fun of the bridge, it gets tinier when it's cold
ayo dunkin is moving to tink??
idk how to feel about this
coolbeanz seems way to small of a place to host a dunkin operation
i just realized what you meant
they will work on it during the summer
rip
I'd rather sell one of my kidneys if you don't mind
Case really said if we don’t have on campus housing available for you then sucks to suck
Confused about the housing email, why would the Class of 2025 size affect the number of sophomores right now trying to get on-campus housing
Since Class of 2025 won't be living in upperclass housing next year (presumably)
The village wasn’t meant for sophomores afaik
One of them is freaking out
Oh that's horrible
I feel terrible for her
Not sure yet, I need to see all my options first
I know merit scholarships aren’t affected at all
i want to get a petition to get those students anqd students with disabilities priority access for on-campus, but im not a good political writer and don't know who to contact about it
does anyone well-spoken want to draft and email that we could all send? i can send something but currently im just worried about my friends so im not about to be composing elegant prose
It doesn’t need to be anything fancy really, but probably don’t email today I’m sure they’re gonna be flooded with messages rn
true, maybe ill leave emails today to people who desparately need on-campus housing
This probably won't impact me, atleast for my junior year, but jesus christ the administrators here are  either money hungry, incompetent, or probably both
cuz their kids dont go here
I so want to reply to that last email telling them to go sit on a thumbtack
Cuz this is not what we signed up for
Can’t wait, I’m emailing the usg prez rip to her
sounds good, let us know what she says, cuz we have yet to have a normal college experience and this is just rubbing salt in the wound
bold of u to assume u will have housing either
WISER is doing a sticker sale and donating the profits to support women in STEM. We need more orders so please buy some 🙂 

https://forms.gle/R2CCG5tvENqXRvve7
Someone really had to set the fire alarm off in our building😐
I was sleeping when it went off rip
I was stressing out when it went off
I went to fribley
not a bad idea
office of employment is doing the same with me
they simply aren't paying me for the hours i have worked for
dept of physics owes me $140. they simply aren't doing anything about it
altho $140 might not seem like a big amount but hey its my money i want it
I haven’t gotten an extra $20 from working overtime a few years ago and I’m still super pissed about that
and now the csds  dept has to pay me money and they're saying "oh we're understaffed rn to process your payment"
i want money
I want an 8th piano
raunak, have you tried calling aswell?
in total, case owes me hundreds of $ but simply aren't paying me 😀
nah man imma go to their office in person today
phys dept told me last sem that they submitted the paperwork last sem while i was working for them. this sem i learned that they simply didn;t. and now they're ghosting me and others who are in the same situation as me
yeah the office of student affairs still hasn’t responded to like 5 emails over the past few weeks I’ve sent them
you will lose at min 11K from aid
I am trying to confim that this is regardless of wether case displaces you, or you choose to leave
You could be living in a ditch and they'd still do it
This is so terrible
The hissy fit kaler went through when he didnt get 3 New IMacs was something to behold
They can’t do basic counting to make sure there’s enough housing
I feel so bad for you guys
What a lovely email that said absolutely nothing anyone wanted to hear
I was just curious how fin aid is affected by different combinations, i.e. what if someone is on-campus but doesn't have the meal plan
We need media attencion
why in the fuck
would anyone ever need that
because he WANTED it
who in the fuck
cuz they WANT it
We can’t subject kaler’s wife to the iPad 2 🥺
omg please don’t go after rha
they literally can’t do anything
how come, they are the rez hall association, this seems up their alley
idk they got told about it two weeks ago but ik the president of rha and he says they can’t really do anything
@howdy_. I’m confused by your announcement about the housing. It’s true that this as a shitty situation for us, but the school can’t actually do anything about it at this point right? Like they just have too many lowerclassmen for the amount of buildings. It’s not like they have extra buildings they’re just not letting us use. They can’t build more housing before next year.
okay just 😆 don’t send them hate emails
this is why you just don’t live on campus
fair
That’s part of what they said in the email, doubt they’ll mobilize everything tho
trying to get exceptions rn to live off campus
i’m transferring if they don’t fix this
I learned that housing is no longer run by student affairs, its run by another division that also runs some of our other *favorite* money grabbing organizations, like parking and dining
i’m just grateful that i have a year until this genuinely affects me, i feel really bad for you guys
Yeah seriously, as someone who CANNOT afford case aside from my grants/financial aid, this is a very terrifying issue for me and I'm so sorry that you all in the same sort of position have to go through this:(
fucking ridiculous
you'd think they would build more dorms before purposefully trying to expand the student body
one of my roommates is moving back on campus bc financial aid is taking away so much money from him like it is very much not ok how unfair it is
In fairness, i don't think they were purposely looking to expand the student pop based off of their emails but they are handling this so so so poorly
i'm personally yayeeting out of this school if $11k+ is removed from my aid
they claimed it was "more than expected" but simply dont accept people if you wont have room to house them currently
to be fair that is a common practice
*can't bite off more than we can chew, can we?*
cwru: we want to expand our student body so many of you that rely on financial aid are going to be forced out of student housing
*people unenroll/transfer out*
yeah they hate us
where is *** ******* when you need him
not me thinking case didn’t care that i was poor
bc theyre trying to become a bigger name school and hAvE to makE SaCrifiCes
ya idk
my therapist ended the meeting after 15 minutes
go away mentally ill student
but as an institution they have to be able to provide for and accommodate that growth
they dont even need to build dorms (they should, but that takes time) but they need to use the buildings they have
and like we literally live in the middle of a city how HARD is it to find new/more housing lmfaoooooo
i live off campus dont be mean to me
apartments on southside?? really
because they dont want fin aid students
they want students who will pay full price
want to minimize their costs huh
meggo you're missing the point
we broke
simply, get more money
we need to raise a shitstorm
I will no longer be able to work at my job
because I dont own a car
i tried to get the 930 rta from cornell to get to the hec for my exam at 10 and it just didnt show up
busted my ass trying to get the hec flyer
"I can't go to CWRU if my fin aid gets cut"

CWRU:
$11k+ gone
I'm not even in the building rn
for what reason tho
You want to tour village housing or sumn?
Yeah @samrobot and I want to tour the Village, we have never visited the upper-class housing
esp since we wont be able to live in it at all
I'm just trying to get the experience even though I won't live in it 💀
oh
OH
yes, if they aint, case REALLY fucked up
which is why i need all the help I can get
either STJ or village
I don't know how many of you know this (and to be honest, I don't know if this was said in an email since I haven't read them all yet since I was already planning to live in an apartment), but the incoming freshman class is 25% larger than last year (despite a smaller acceptance rate) since the president wants to "make Case more public." Not sure how that's supposed to happen when we have a housing deficiency. Plus, CWRU used to chase prestige. Why they didn't lower the acceptance rate this year to do that is beyond me. We are literally having the scenario Harvard spends millions of dollars on: to get a ton of applicants and only accept a few.
We cannot be OSU or UMich. We don't have room.
i refuse to believe they're this incompetent but are instead trying to force financial aid students off of campus
for moar money
this is something that wouldn't have been hard to predict ahead of time
they could've started preparing for it
on the faq for financial aid thats what they said I dont really understand it either
Eveyone post a thread about this on r/applyingtocollege, the prefroshes haven't made their decisions yet
oh and also college confidential
And RMP, doesnt it have a school rating option?
Don't know
Name and Shame: Case Western Reserve University
Idk what your point is but try working a job as a full time student in order to pay for housing and maybe you’ll realize how terrible this sounds. This is the last thing people want to hear during this predicament
Fucking over the class that had zoom for a yr 😭😭
Dead wrong
they overcharged us for zoom university, didnt give us a college experience, and are now increasing tuition, decreasing fin aid, and decreasing housing
I'm not sure how exactly they would fix this? Maybe revoke some acceptances, since they don't come out until March?
Yk if Case really be doing this and they care about how they look more than their students, a media expose would really fuck them over
its happened to two of my friends
Thats true, my thoughts would be to clean up the unused areas and server them as dorms, if they want to ahve people off campus, help subsidize the cost, I'm not sure what the answer is, but i'm sure we can think of some
~~Can't run out of housing space if you admit less freshmen :think: ~~
um someone stole my debit card information 😁🤗🤗
Cancel the card and contact ur bank, hope the dmg wasnt too much
oh it was a lot of money
Had it happen twice to me in hs, overall 3/10 very annoying situation
Mf stole my card information and spent 700 bucks at a bike shop in Germany
like i don’t have enough shit going on
fuck me i suppose ! 🙏
but there’s not much they can do unfortunately
ah ok that's not too bad then
theoretically they could but they said that’s a last resort
wtf
last resort?
So Case will cut your aid even if they are the ones who force you to live off campus? The only reason I'm on campus is because of the aid.

This shit sucks
The tuition increased 
Financial aid was cut more than before 
They're just kicking students who depend on aid out
i hate you
leave erwin out of this
i don't hate erwin though :0
i just don't like his eyebrows
ugh we never said i was very bright did we 💔
i hate eren
you didn't quite spoil yourself doe
Damn he’s just like me
anyways i need to go read 💔
@spirit5oul Don't 🤨 me
Its in the announcement atm, unless i forgot to save it
Crying at them talking about the campus being safe then showing the ZBT house
case really be out here
"help me stepsnowplow, im stuck"
I can't help but think this was an attempt to not have to shell out for students on scholarships
its quite simple, removed fin aid students, increase full price students, and even without increasing class size they will be making more money
adding more in class size is just an added benefit
@zacharious Just don't take algebra, take applied classes like math of data science instead
Just bc it isn't directly applicable doesn't mean it isn't useful in some way
Bruh I frequently stayed up until 3 AM working on linear algebra and I heard abstract is even harder
Idk about later algebra doe
Beyond that, doesn’t matter to me
Stupid phone
It wasn't me
during the weekdays yeah, idk about weekends (except in the evenings)
they served me food but it took forever
I tried putting this in self-promos but it said it was read-only 😔
oh no he got hacked
rip
Anyone have a Saturday morning flight (March 5th) and wants to join my Uber group, we'll cut costs by amount of ppl, plan is for 3-4ish AM
No, but Bro is down for me tho
Given the fact that mask mandates are being dropped all across the country due to new CDC guidelines, what's our estimate for when the mask requirement at CWRU ends?
Never
Never hopefully
I hope never
I have never seen you with a mask. Ironic
Anyone landing around 10am who wants to Uber back to campus? DM please
Heads up: health services is telling people who were exposed to COVID to continue to attend class and take exams. This happened to two people I know. Ignore the fact that they're allowing us to not wear masks; I strongly advise that you mask up.
So really badly 😂
Damn David
Can't believe it's been about year or so since I joined
does anyone want to join our housing group in the village? We're gonna do a 4 person suite and need 1 more
oh im late but thank you all for the bday wishes! :)
has anyone taken summer classes and transferred them
i gotchu bestie i want a role 💔💔💔
i just realised house 3 doesn't have a laundry room
wtf
Oi don’t use house 2 :nkoGun:
oops wrong server....
I got a class approved at tri-c and did it there, dunno if it’d be any different for OSU or other places
ultimately yeah, ideally wanted to take phys lab on tuesday but instead have to take thursday
That’s not too bad also
I scared, excited, and frightened at the same time for junior year. 18 credits with research and UH volunteering also
I’m ditching SI tho
8:15 class though 😭
is it goated tho i heard its brutal
im greenlinking to class every day aint no way imma walk 20 minutes just for biochem
when did you take it? last fall?
oh i meant last semester
i feel that
i didnt sleep so i feel u
time to cry next sem
cuz im taking 115 with 307
oh im taking those this semester
idk anxious
OH
omg
it's still strangi
Not so early in the morning
idk how to walk
It’s happened to me quite a bit tho I learnt some hacks for that also
homie u act as if we’ve never taken a greenlink in our life 💀
like we had a little R but idk if it was as much as the normal R version
oh gotcha cuz its cross-listed
Did you have multiple minors or am I confusing u with someone else?
i can make the major work
queen shit
altho i shouldnt really count chem lol
don’t u have to take an extra class for the minor after ochem
oh oops
oh sick
U need to take labs tho for the minor or an additional course
i was about to say I’m taking pchem for nothing but it’s for my major
so technically it’s not for nothing
oh you don’t automatically get it
I gotta go through all the work to get dr drew to respond to an email 💀💀
Do you ever automatically get anything? The amount of paper work you have to fill for everything is insane
hm fair
that was a dumb question I’m sorry
bruh i still need to turn in my forms
Since they wanted tb blood work also
and flu shot
So you need a sponsor
Then, fill up all the other 10 documents or so if I’m not wrong
oh you need a doctor to sign that form in advance?
yeah i just need to ask cle clinic for the tb work and flu shot
About flu shot, it depends on when you’re doing it
Sorry for sounding sarcastic. I guess I was just tired and drained myself
first you dont have pancakes
now you close
yep, just did one last week
i had to, but i work there so i have to get it done annually
It is crazy how many more steps we need to go through to shadow at UH/Cleveland Clinic than local hospitals
ccf isn't even taking college volunteers atm we love to see it
I don't think they've taken volunteers since COVID began
There's a waitlist to volunteer? Wtf
Basically what happened was a lot of people got screwed out of volunteering because of COVID and are all trying to make it up at the same time
Usually they don't have this issue and are sometimes even a little bit short
I'll definitely take on more shifts if there's spots left. One three hour shift isn't a lot and I've found that having at least two shifts is adequate to really get a feel for the environment
4 if you really want to get a feel for it and become part of the team
there are paid clinical opportunities too. it's easier to get involved in volunteering though
seriously?
That's what I've heard. Don't know how true it is
same, I’m also just in a shit mood today so 💀
Because 2 step annoying
Blood work
I don't have time to pop into UH 4 times
My PCP back home did it wrong and the University of Toledo was either going to make me retake it or I could have my blood drawn
2-step is worse because the needle is spicier and I find the bump irritating
has anyone else been seriously doubting themselves lately and contemplating a gap year? no? just me? okie
That’s weird tho. There used to be a TB option before that disappeared
all i remember is hating having to drive all the way to the hospital for someone to literally look at my arm
Yeah I don't see a way to explicitly request a TB test
In login page go to do you need to section
yeah they're p strict unfortunately
Didn’t you need tb for volunteer tho
Last time I did TB was a year ago for volunteering at a local hospital
Omg Gatorade for losing 5 mL of blood? Dude cmon
i think thats monster energy given their whole "sticky blood"
Ok so whats the cheapest way to get groceries over the summer that preferably doesn’t require an hour on the RTA?
alternatively, leaving cleveland and never returning
I’m gonna be in Village- how far is Daves by RTA?
I think but idk
I don’t know about north side
it's not a bad ride at all imo
missed the target shuttle back and took it home
either friends or last summer I used a place called sussen self storage
so don't say 420 :nkoGun:
smoking is bad for your lungs, I dont think a 4 leaf clover can prevent cancer
Smoking bad I agree
the most awk 5 minutes of my day as i tried to talk to bellew on zoom
the presidents secretaries computer
Damn
our tuition dollars at work...
damn this server dead as fuck LMAO
have no problems sharing it either bc i just wanna see people do well
so long as people send me the homework i will pump out exam sheets
that was me leaving my final today
I’m taking it thru lockdown
I don’t have it but her finals are the same level as the practice tests she gives you
She didn’t give it back
big sad
DOES ANYONE HAVE SCOTCH PACKING TAPE I RAN OHT
had to have my weekly freak out a bit early goddamn 😑
sorry
I lost my shit
Where are the accounting majors when you need them?
I said the same thing while proofreading the audit. This is a huge problem! Fortunately they are having a large leadership change, and the incoming leaders have already been interested in reforming.

In the meantime, as a shameless self-promo, I highly suggest anyone who is interested in helping clean up this mess continues to follow the work of the SEC Allocations Committee. Y'all can also reach out if your club did not get the mass funding you need, as I've already seen people get rejected on stuff they should not get rejected on.
i dont think its publicized anywhere, i tried googling it
It had tom holland and didn't really flop per say
go to sleep mfer
fucking boomer
loser, I can't talk
You were drifting off on our phone call
Sleepy time
don’t tell me what to do
Has anyone else's ID stopped working on the elevators in the BRB?
This reminds of the video you showed me about the guy getting stuck in the stairs 💀
#MATH 444
it won't let me get to my lab in BRB though
Rip
Until you have to stay up until 4 am working on projects (totally not speaking from my roommates’ experiences🥲🤪)
Instead, be like Zach and don’t get enough sleep and wake up at 4 am
Lot of work tho
You’ll be kinda screwed if you end up waiting till the last day to work on the hw
He has never woken up at 4am
Can confirm: typical zach sleep schedule is to fuck it up so bad that he is nocturnal, so he powers through a day, goes to bed at 8pm, wakes up at 4. Once he is on a "normal" schedule he will mess it up over the following week to the point of when the cycle repeats
You’re not wrong
Last I heard someone going to bed at 8 pm was in elementary school
True, that's not even the worst I've heard about that class. One of my friends who usually goes to sleep at like midnight told me he had to pull an all-nighter for that class so I think he was awake for 30+ hours. Sounds like hell tbh
How can one work when they’re sleepy
Did they study with focus
I went a bit overboard playing satisfactory at the beginning of this summer and briefly had a sleep schedule of 36 awake / 12 asleep
you dont simply sleep when u could be making the factory grow
Eabha,.. Girliepop, rocket nerd, and fellow person ... how do you even stay up 36 hours straight?
Idrk, I was up all night and after that I just kinda wanted to see how far I could take it
I figured I wouldn’t get another chance to stay up that late anytime soon
Damn alright
I’m either awake cuz of Jetlag lol or fun reasons
Not studying
I stayed up for 36 hours once
Can’t you exit from rainbow and be basically standing in front of millis?
From UHCMC, I don’t think you can get to rainbows
Hmmm I coulda sworn I saw signs pointing towards rainbow (like how to get there within the hospital) but I don’t know
It’s all connected, but so fucking hard to navigate sometimes
Except when going to the ER, which has misleading signs that will literally lead you out of the hospital
Honestly I like how UH has “street names” for certain hallways. Makes navigating the hospital much easier
Now all they need to do is make a GPS app😌
Either way the inside of hospitals should be mapped out on a navigation app
jeez this tuition hike hitting hard
15% tuition hike makes cost big ouch
oh damn
$54k is for last year 2021-2022
But I wasn’t aware about this past year
Are they trying to compensate for the money lost over the last 2 years?
Or are they trying to profit in this economy
I don’t really keep up with CWRU’s finances except for USG lol
Last year's tuition increase was only 2%
But that’ll be our last year
Crazy to think the cost of attendance for the class of 2026 without any aid is 81k, for 2024 it was 72k
Which is why he wants to massively increase enrollment and fees
reminder that we were warned by his previous school to NOT hire him
*doesn't compound*
I’m taking a macroeconomics class for shits n giggles and I highly suggest not doing what I’m doing, it’s just making me more pissed at the magic math
Magic math is one of the reasons why I’m considering a major in econ
I just don’t know what other breadth req to take apart from finance
any of the courses really
cant relate to the game theory thing I just like pressing the buttons
Oh no
rip to u
my thermo final last sem was at that time
My friend had a final exam at night
I was gonna have a 7:30-10:30 PM final followed by an 8 AM final the next morning in Fall 2021 but the class with the 7:30 PM schedule didn't have a final
energy drinks bad
Don’t have bang
not really
have you had the white monster tho
This ruling also may mean that I will need to move my permanent residence out of the US. The decision calls for doing away with decisions decided via substantive due process. Interracial marriage was decided via substantive due process.
I highly doubt it will come to that, but I already felt punched in the stomach hard enough when they overturned Roe. Really didn't need this on top of it
they'll probably go after same-sex marriage and relations next, since those cases were specifically referenced as needing to be revisited in the decision
still scary tho
Well …. Fuck
I just moved into my apartment today and now this happened
I’m considering leaving the country too
I don’t know if I wanna live here when I’m older
Every day I actually feel unsafe
And roe v. Wade actually is a death sentence for women who have been told that carrying their pregnancies to term could be fatal to them and/or their unborn child
So if any woman is told that in a state where abortion is banned, they’ve been given a death sentence
Oh
Pre-meds how tf r u applying directly? I feel so suffocated just thinking about the process and trying to do things or live life (LOR,MCAT, AMCAS app, Secondary, Interview etc.) . It's like common app on steroids and on top of that you need to score well in senior year also as it's part of matriculation while spending half of your time flying away for interviews during Jan. As a BME on pre-med track, I'm strongly considering to take a gap year. I feel I can balance my things that way as senior year is generally lighter. I feel Wes Schaub also guided me saying to take MCAT summer of junior year being engr student. Suddenly, I realized that it is a gap year and got a panic attack frantically setting meeting with healthcare consultant. Even though I know I'm doing quite a bit, it's tiring to even see the MCAT portions like CARS and what not. It uses all of my brain lol. Anyways, I'm strongly thinking of taking gap year and my Indian parents have accepted it also. Sometimes, I see BME alternatives also. I think it's the free time in summer that also causes me to spiral a bit plus clincial research application and UH saying it cannot be done unless ur in USA. That's also frustrating. This is the most real potrayal I can do but just wanted to know about you guys.
If you think you need to take a gap, you probably do
But if you’re considering BME options as well explore those too—my parents told me to have a backup just in case med school doesn’t work out
Yeah, you need a backup. However, the health care consultant sent me official data saying that 68% of 2021 batch applicants in CWRU matriculated into a med school
But agreed I just started studying for the mcat and it makes my head spin lol
Doesn’t matter how smart you are or how strong your app is
Are you doing internship in your major or so? I see people doing Medtronic internship and then becoming clinical specialists or MRI engineers later on. Regardless, I want to work in healthcare industry somehow
Private person sorry bestie
But yeah I feel that.. if you wanna do Medtronic then do it?
The way I can’t focus for more than 2-3 hours at a time🤩🤩
the way I can’t focus period 💔
The way i can’t
Haven’t touched content stuff in a week OOPS
Lmao, I haven’t even started. I’m chilling with parents lol with a bit of work. It’s 7 hr 30 min seated full time
Yeah. I went back after my shadowing for a month in UH
Lol yea its p sick
Couldn’t watch after the first episode
Slow af
First episode is slow but after that, it’s something else
Kinda wanted darth vader to say “I have the high ground now”
didn't feel earned
Why tf didn’t he kill vader
||Same. I have a feeling he’s gonna die in vol 2 ||
(I am sure I spelled that wrong)
On my phone
*gasp* I don’t see it on my end
Nothing
it says “open” on my App Store so maybe it’s an iPhone issue
Well shit it now says update
Yeah auto updates work when they want to
And that’s never
*still frantically checks Canvas* actually there’s no way out
Yee i stopped checking daily
U should only check grades when ur in the right headspace bc it can ruin your mood if you did bad or make u feel good but distract from ur work if u did good
My anxious brain won’t let me
Ok the issue is, I’m never in the right headspace
Or studying
Or working or something that needs ur attention
Yeah fair
My heart rate skyrockets any time I get an email from Canvas about my exam grade
ISTG can’t do better than that on any other test
Unless you’re taking physics like me, where there is potential to score less than a 50 on an exam
Bro that class is supposed to be the hardest class at CWRU
How some people have described the class: "Hell", "Torture", "Why?"
@absence000 still at tippit 110?
I forgot that shit immediately after moving out
i miss my dorm room ngl
I wrote my dorm off as soon as I realized it had no elevator on the 9th floor :chefkiss:
esp since staley's elevator's were broken half the time
We figured out the secret though
But that meant someone had to go all the way to the bottom floor if it stopped working :vibe:
"sir i swear this elevator will pass the inspection just kick the doors closed"
That elevator was a death trap
Our last washer broke 1 month before the end of school and they just elected not to fix it
They really had senioritis hit hard
That sink could have been built to the highest possible standard and it still would have gone
someone washed their mop in one of the machines and that's when i gave up on cwru student body's hygiene
Yeah the 8th floor boys described to me how it broke
i will never get over that
no just the end of it
Remember freshman year when someone just dumped mud in one of the machines
i didn't look inside the machine close enough when i sent the groupme text
Someone really looked at a mop
I miss my home laundry machine :naenae:
I wish I lived close to campus
and realized
North Carolina is VERY far away
cuz i have space in the car
west virginia doesn't exist
Oh TRUEEEE
I prefer to put my clothes in the rain and hope they wash
why don't you just... move your laundry day?
cuz i will always prefer my washing machine at home than one that was used by the previous tenant
You never know what kind of mops were in that machine before you
well fair ig
i will for sure do laundry in my apartment during the school year cuz sadly i won't be able to go home often
but i have never stepped foot in it
You're not missing much
We used to have a cafe but they closed it :vibe:
i wish my building had a cafe
but it doesn't
I will be broke in weeks if i step foot there
i have gone to the euclid starbucks sm this summer my bank account is hurty
the guilt built up so damn fast
Its not bad or good
I havent been yet
I still need to go
I've been out of town all weekend though and this was when i meant to go
So guess I'm glad I missed out if its that expensive :vibe:
like the donut wasn't even big
REALLY
i haven't been to tink this summer
But I don;t know what it is
I'm hoping its more laundry machines 😎
i don't wanna create more opportunities for someone to wash their mop
i mean i dont like tink so i aint living there
Oh lord
She tried to feed them to me and I was the one who pointed out they were 2 years expired
I still ate one anyway :smug:
Short term memory loss
Some stuff that happened in staley shall stay in Staley
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT SMELLED LIKE
I’m not laughing at you to make you feel bad
i bet all the action happened on the first floor anyway since the elevator was always broken
I’ve never said Astaghfirullah so many times in one night
climbing staley stairs until 9th floor >>>>>>>>> working out at veale
I wasn’t doing, I witnessed
Elevators can be really slow tho
idc, at least my weak lungs won't be on the verge of collapsing on themselves
i have allergies that cause asthma symptoms🤡
so i can never beat the lung collapse
Awwww
it's ok tho i have it under control now but 🤡
I pulled my back out at the start of last semester and I could barely walk anywhere for a week :vibe:
So bad
oh no
I have bad genes
And then just couldn't get back up
oh
it took me 10 months to squeeze a diagnosis out from a physician as to why i was coughing
so you're telling me the school nurse didn't give you an ice pack???
Well I called them and said my dad who is a physician told me to warm it up to loosen the muscle until the school could do something
aren't all dads
OH
"i need to overcome my fear for blood so imma just choose a career centered around it"
crying😂
bruh really??
He followed an ER surgeon until he wasn't afraid of blood anymore
When I shadowed a surgeon over break I held someone's lung so maybe there's hope for me yet :fingerguns:
Its really hard
So the surgeon was at my dad's old hospital in Raleigh
so i'm honestly not too worried
You only need 50-60 hours or something I think?
nothing too crazy
one could crank out their shadowing req in a week and a half if they chose to
just don’t need to clog up general with career/med school apps
Also, I wrote a whole shadowing reflecting that Dr. Baeza wanted but no response
The earth will erode away before those forms are signed :Angryhaha:
They are so slow
50 mail threads during last winter break
don’t want to be an asshole here
anyways my apologies it’s been a shit 2 weeks but please just listen before I start crying lol

Probably summer 2020 and I wasn’t doing jack shit
ugh I’d join vc if I didn’t have an exam tomorrow morning💔
People got really mad and I couldn’t handle them being mad at me
And I got really upset💀😭 that’s when my sister deleted general
uh oh
oh right I had her freshman year for 122
stop talking ab it I realized I did an oopsie
Probably weren’t supposed to share that would be my guess
i fucked up sorry everyone
But nonetheless don’t wanna flame her for being cautious
From a student standpoint it’s funny cuz other professors don’t do that
probably she just dislikes me already so
I don’t need people reporting me
Us students would never cheat…
Bro i was delayed like 3 days in my work bc I ran into a networking error with WSL that was a literal nightmare
and now im behind 😦
Ik but she doesn’t trust us 😔

The last 2 years were a mess :cocoyyell:
I want freshman me to still have hope
Sorry, i don't respond to people who aren't the queen of something 🙄

I’m gonna get a jersey girls don’t pump gas sticker do u guys want one
I am getting a new laptop that will need new bumper stickers, so unfortunately yes
The sticker says "girls don't pump gas"?
sticker says “jersey girls don’t pump gas”
bc nj doesn’t let you pump ur own gas
why not though
it’s stupid
They’re the same I think they just don’t trust jersey trash to pump gas
the dreaded new jersey gas drinker had to be stopped
i'll die if i get deprived of oxygen

I feel this with my summer project
I wanted to finish data collection by the end of this week but that's not happening
was hoping to publish in August
idk what it will be yet, but I have some ideas
yeah I just don't want to deal with it during the fall because MCAT
and frankly this project should have been done a month and a half ago but anaerobic chamber computer choked
then we bought one that didn't work and we had to buy another new computer
also I just don't want to deal with this project anymore lolmao
I want pizza
I don't like either of those
I like think, but I don't like minds
Not living in Ohio for a whole 3 months does wonders
Although if everything is Ohio… wouldn’t that mean we’re always in Ohio
Idk

Plth don’t leave me alone with toxic malilities
oh nvm
I can’t find my laptop 💀
rip
holy shit this guy is an actual super genius
the thumbnail hit hard
yeah holy shit
I can't imagine how complicated just putting the pieces together is without them slipping
let alone all of the rest of it
And on PC
Don't expose me like this
i personally don't feel like talking atm 💀
rip
Hyped for the classes, not for the work they have lol
I'm sad some of my texts didn't show
Oh wow really Sherlock?
Not me cause I still haven’t decided my classes
Oh damn you got me
Hahaha……bro I haven’t taken ai yet
nope, you just get a "fresh" 800 to spend
it also sucks that we can only use them during add-drop period
oh bruh
that's just stupid
Got 5 hours of sleep, which was about 2 more than expected
Grinding for an OChem exam on Monday
Because I couldn’t take it next semester
Fair enough
I didn’t want to do it!!!
But Kevin and I were judges so we got to bed earlier than expected and then slept an hour into our morning shift because we could
I was expecting to spend like an half an hour after my 10-2 shift doing stuff and then having to get up at 5:30 for my 6-10 shift but didn't
I have to shave every day or else my beard grows back if I don't shave for even a day
oh gosh💀
surprisingly I don't recall being asked if I was Arab
Cuz he likes it
Which is fair given the history
english sucks
because the sun never sets on the bri'ish empire
Shsh guys, don’t speak ill of your ~~colonizers~~ heroes
i just can't english
I like captain America because he doesn’t do drugs
We need diversity
he never fails to make me laugh so hard
So um it appears the old bookstore place is being turned into a planet fitness??
Before anyone says this, Veale is too far (unless I choose to work out after class)
Don't know how expensive Orange Theory is compared to them
If I was I probably would’ve died by now
Have you tried chickpeas or soy-based products?
They both taste bad
Yea lol. Even if it was available I wouldn’t want to have it tbh
hahahahaha, you wish
One can only wish
Tofurkey is something I didn’t know existed lmao
Idk about fermented but I miss my friend’s mom’s idli and dosa from time to time
I can’t remember now
Man I wish I could have homemade idli again
That sounds so American that I don’t even know what it is
Before we knew I was allergic to lentils, my nanama would make her dosa out of lentils. It slapped, but my feet got tortuously itchy for weeks afterward
I thought dosa batter was made of rice? I don’t know, the batter we buy is white sooooo
Bruh I don’t think Indians differentiate between fermented rice and regular😭
I don’t know though
Idk man I just devour whatever they serve
I hate you
Unfortunately :/
What’s wrong w them they have some of the lowest membership prices from what I remember
Really?
Why does it feel like 7pm
Fr I am so tired
I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow
I’d quite frankly die
I had mine on Thursday
I can't get in until the end of August
Good thing I don't really need new ones
I didn’t need them either but my glasses were 6 years old
sometimes I roll on top of them when I sleep though
That’s not the worst of it. Sometimes my sister sleeps with her contacts in
well if I put them on my nightstand in college sometimes they fall and take like half an hour to find
happened like twice last year
It took us so long to scold her into taking them off mighty
a woman got an amoeba infection because she left them in for too long
That’s so stupid lmao
I was ab to do that then I realized that mine actually works
i feel like I’m being tempted
i miss vine
except for zoom university
cuz they didn't want on-campus students leaving campus
last year we didn't have labor day off iirc?
didn't we have everything off?
freshman year was when we didn't have days off
we don’t have to pay for Microsoft office though right
Not yet~
Hard to do since Acrobat checks for a subscription
Tuition went up this year :/
Living off campus has taken nothing from Case
wtf
The year is 2037, Dr Zach LeClaire just assigned an intern a task a normal human being would take 420 hours to do and asked him to finish it by next weeks meeting.
ever done math on meth?
@addat getting your drunk friend to do your math hw is not the kinda academic integrity that i was expecting from you smh
You're just jealous, I got a 100% on that assignment
It was 3am and zach was like "im drunk but I promise I can still do math"
Didn't I once give you a lecture on heat exchanges once when I was a bit off?
the sequel we need
If you leave your fridge open for 10 min a day it can help combat global warming
that is too much work i simply turn down the temperature on the earth's thermostat
I’m sorry but you have to explain it to us while you’re drink on paper with diagrams and all
I still have CS declared
its by the kitchen closet, you can move the slider up and down, but it doesnt really do anything but move the vent slightly open or closed
oh for the earth
Guess where
It doesn’t exist
Toledo gave me bad vibes when I visited
Damn. I get tired and crash. If someone asks me to do math, I don’t think I’ll do diff eqs
I don’t think full xl exists
Didn’t realize this until I got one myself
I guess but still
Especially for sprawling out notes for studying
i cannot study on my bed. my back will make sure of this
I feel that. Back is screwed but best part is u can sleep after that so it recovers
Chilly coz I’m used as body shield for wind
You don’t
fuck
Nah you stand and use your bed as a giant desk without writing ability
I've been wondering why there is such a focus on memorization in bio & chem education?
it seems kinda silly to me
Because the profs aren't engineering profs they don't know how to google
For chemistry, it depends. It’s not really memorization for the most part when concepts build up or pchem for example. For bio, college education focuses on understanding of concepts
It *appears* that these courses mostly reward memorization, but when you take a step back, how can you adequately apply biological and chemical concepts to scenarios if you haven’t fully learned/memorized them? Doesn’t this go for virtually any subject out there?
I’d argue that chemistry is more application-based, since there’s a lot more math involved (well, maybe not as much in ochem, but physics is involved in all chem fields)
But application is a fundamental skill to have in bio too— there’s just a lot more concepts to memorize densely. Chem is dense but really you don’t need all that extra info. In bio, you do
For chem and physics especially, you have to do problems
Idk man
didn't know shit
Have you used flax in last year?
It's only supposed to be this one
ugh if only
I got new glasses ~~and they don’t even work properly~~
Physics wallah is goated tho for phys 2
Do you need an iClicker for Rekha
wondering if I should sell mine for monies
You never need iclicker. Just use your notebook and later see if you got it right or not
Oh yeahhhh 😅😅
No you don’t. Sell your iclicker
I didn’t like either of those movies
apparently I’m in good health otherwise but my red blood cells are small and pale
except rotated
You just broke the first 2 rules of it
Bruh we never talk about it
SMH you guys broke it too
Nope
Yea but I never talked about “it”
Never
So 3 rules broken
So we’re beating the shit out of you and you’re gonna stand there and use math?
I will be flash coz you can’t see my blows
is anyone on campus yet?
I’m getting there today
idk when i'm moving there yet kek
one of my suitemates is moving in on the 22nd so i wanted to see if i could move in early for free :LAUGH:
sometimes they dont work tho
starbucks is dangerously close to the greenlink and nursing stop
Please stop the bus for us
OMG
Wait nvm I don’t do caffeine anymore 💀
If you really have to
even w milk alone it tastes mid
That’s a lame excuse
It doesn’t change the fact it’s unhealthy
Tell that to older you when you’re sick
Oh?
cuz it'll have bad chemicals in it
Because I want to hang out 👉👈
worse than actual sugar
Fair
i am so lost
i just don't know what to prioritize
Study time
and i signed up for an econ class
like idk if i can handle that...????????
but also i'll be supa behind in the econ major if i don't start now?
and i could minor but like ugh
idk what to do
it's either i choose psych or econ as my secondary major
but the reason why im lost is cuz course offerings vary on a semesterly basis
and worse case i overload on econ classes senior year
There is no need to hurry
it's extra $$$ tho
Although I wouldn’t recommend summer classes I wanted to yank my hair out and cry all the time 💀💀
cuz if i just minored in econ that would be a 4th minor
orrrrrrr i just stuck to double majoring w psych and minor in econ
idk
But don’t overload yourself
You want to live
GIRL IM THE LAST PERSON YOU SHOULD BE TAKING NOTES FROM
for me that's econ and psych! but what if i can't find enough econ classes in future semesters
You definitely can, and if you can’t you can minor or do a bunch of summer classes to offset it
i've taken too many classes at this point. i need to fill up my semesters💀
i frontloaded when i shouldn't have
America. Nutrition needs improving
Like, go for whatever you want but don’t forget to remain centered
Sosososo important and I didn’t realize that until spring semester
the reason for this dilemma is mainly due to me realizing my limits
And this isn’t a bad thing—you should be happy that you realized this now!!!!!
Is a horrible idea
Rather than way too late
Don’t want a toll on physical health
and worse case i just take a bunch of fun classes
cuz WHY NOT
Yeah that’s fair
but if i do that i won't have many options for my senior year schedule
do it! it's not bad at all
did you take 102/103 yet?
Did 102 last semester taking 103 this
cuz if so then econ major is doable but idk how far along you are in your engineering major
sadly
cuz econ is a viable degree still
im pre med still but given how random the med school admissions process is, i need to have other options open
dunno how far a neuro degree could get me other than academia
but v close
Have you taken micro
Did both last sem
I had Grible. Got a 96 and never attended a single lecture lmfao
I swear I be falling asleep
Is anyone able to get into the wade music parts
damn
it’s weird because I’m enrolled in lessons and music ensembles so idk why it won’t let me in
Grible is worse
Maybe cuz the semester hasn’t started?
classes havent started yet, the card acess starts then
since he's asleep atm
So I feel you
Smh they really reconstructing everything here
Gravel piles and closed sidewalks
R.i.p. scenic Southside view
It’s gone
Oh damn
Damn we lucked out
It’s not worth worrying over things that are not in our hands like college admissions also. Besides, 68% of CWRU students were accepted last year in a med school
Not worried about the future
Just keeping my options open. There’s a difference
I’ve simply stopped caring, because whatever happens happens
2016 happened later than 2020
does anyone want to do anything on vc
Can someone send me the Wade office timings?
The website still shows summer timings
Isn’t it actually 365.25 days in a regular year
If you wanna make your math extra difficult factor that in :lmfno:
is anyone on campus yet?
If it's not taken, can I reserve just by showing up
Friday night I’ll sleep with you since I won’t have bed sheets and topper
I’m lowkey shitting my pants and getting nightmares before leaving on Friday
With respect to work and EC’s. Already getting like 15 emails every day
I’m worried coz it’s kinda expensive and I don’t want it to be lost before I’m there
Are you still in need of help? I could provide assistance
It's probably one of my favorite places to eat on Euclid now (can't top Flame though)
However I just can’t recover from how they put ice-cold chickpeas on our chaat once
No but I've wanted to try it
"But, in the longer term, having a system to identify and access the underlying data could be more significant. Right now, most publishers require relevant data to be shared, but there's often no formal way of enforcing that requirement, and it's widely ignored. Making it a condition of funding can obviously change that."
OMG WE RANTED ABOUT THIS IN MY LAB EARLIER THIS SUMMER
I don't even think that's the biggest thing here
It also might mean that the frequent publishing people are going to have to publish more negative data if they want to publish the way they do now, since I doubt their research is nearly as rigorous
We need to go there
This is going to lay the replication crisis bare and probably cause an earth-shattering shift in so many areas of research
I can tell you right now that there are definitely people in Cleveland Clinic and CWRU that are scared
I will swipe that cdep card at Bombay chaat so fast
Damn actually that might just work
I still have only 3 courses released out of 6 but feel like puking just reading the syllabus and knowing I got an assignment  due on Thursday itself
To be fair, restaurants can never compare to actual food
I went there?
Isn’t pho noodles
Shit
I forgot to send this
Bye
Why is it cold
Y’all Indians always complain about how cold it is 🙄
the outside is not cold
It was a bit windy but it wasn’t thaaat cold
Better cold than hot
How does the shuttle to Dave’s work?
I don’t see it on the app
But I don’t know if it’s been added yet
I tried using it the other day and it didn't work for me or Adam
the new saferide app is bad for both drivers and riders, is big sadge
They do close at 8
Omg early bird gang
So if the Prof doesnt show up in 15min, we are legally allowed to leave
And two assignments due on first week
And rain
It’s been awful this whole week :(
Too many freshman taking it up!
Can anyone at Cameron please, I left my charger at their suite
i don't see it
@spacemanboris  thoughts on the death of the queen?
Wrong Ben fesko :vibe:
I never understood the point of british royalty
i will never understand the point of british royalty
RIP Queen Elizabeth
Did someone summon me
what happened
it’s all the annoying assholes
jokes it’s their shit policies and adherence to government laws
and the fact that case wireless is awful
wasn't even the case wireless it twas my own apartment's wifi
Technically dsi but dsi is apparently a sub company owned by spectrum 🫠
i pay for spectrum at my place and it lowkey sucks ngl
We have spectrum and it sucks
Like it does the job most of the time but still
Reminds me of how one of Canada's largest internet providers went off a day after canada said they wont give russia their turbines or something like thag
Any math 121 si here?
Dam u up early
Not really
Doesn’t she teach the other bioc?
I’ve heard that class is torture
This year it won’t be hopefully since we only have one professor teaching it
But I don’t know I’m terrified for this exam tomorrow
Isn’t the class TWTF @sprinkles2108
That seems p helpful NGL
And I signed up to study the brain
Studying
oh you're studying the brain? Then what am I thinking right now
The prof said that if you want an A you need to attend the optional Monday lecture 💀💀
Yo wtf? 😂😂
It’s interesting especially since there’s a decent amount of math however it’s a lot and very fast paced
Was I supposed to feel motivated after watching this
I don’t hate her
It’s just that the other class seems better
scary .
@sprinkles2108 :CRYING:  my face when approaching the AA sequence matching
The way I could’ve either done ok or completely wrecked the exam is really bothering me
I wish I studied harder smh
I ate amino acids this morning 🙂
I even ate a few just now
I just realized this joke may not be coming off as intended and I should probably stop
I won’t lie I don’t get it
What ever happened to the Dave’s shuttle?
I took it away because y'all couldn't behave
fuck Multi-Dimensional Secant Methods
All my homies hate them
I'm going to deep-fry my fucking hand brb
lmk how it goes I’m very interested
Lf anyone who is taking or took csds 101 plz dm i need help
isnt that in september tho?
aw helllll nah
before 2022 end, who wanna admit they got a crush on me
Anyone wanna help my friend from TAMU with her operating systems exam review?
You missed self defense again today
ive never heard of the prowler, whats it from
into the spiderverse, no lyrics or anything but the instrumentals alone are pretty spooky and villain-y
Anyone know what’s up with the air quality today? I noticed it was foggy yesterday and today my weather app says the air quality is not great
Does anyone know of an electronics recycler on campus? I have an old laptop battery that needs to be disposed of before it blows up in my closet.
the fact that case is trying to push off their terrible energy waste on students with the promise of a "pizza party" is types of corporate shenanigans that thought impossible outside of middle management
couldnt they hav waited until AFTER we graduated :angery:
we still got libgen, just dont let tiktok know about it
I saw that lol, I thought they trying to save a few bucks by making it seem like a competition
myself included.. he doesn’t speak for all the Jewish students on this campus ://
Just remember to email direct @ president@case.edu, replying won’t go thru
I’m Jewish and I’m more worried about Israel supporters than I am about Kanye west supporters
Can anyone actually see the previous posts from that instagram account and find information on that organization? I can't. Call me a tinfoil hat wearer, but something smells a bit fishy.
It claims 39 posts, yet all but one are hidden
there are no references to Cleveland for Palestine anywhere on the internet
reverse image search of the logo turns up nothing
I would agree if we didn’t have a rise in anti semitic attacks
I mean it does seem at least a little suspect that this account has one visible post, no other internet footprint, and no mission statement or explanation or anything in the bio. It seems like the account is being used to add a kind of outside legitimacy to the issue
That is also my guess. I just feel like I shouldn’t have to guess
The resolution was penned by multiple groups though right?
Some dude decided to drive on the running track last night and got stopped by the security 😂
It’s just rain
go. outside.
omg did you go outside and touch some grass?
No I went to my balcony
I’m a CS major I don’t leave my apartment
My weather app is broken
I’ve been staring at this photo for the past 2 days trying to figure out what the bar is at the top
iphone hole thing at top?
aww
lmao my thing isn't even loading at all
i think we broke it
We do be spinning tho
bruh how was my sages selection at 1/17 open seats by the time i tried registereing this morning
does that mean the whole class was full of seniors that are taking their last sages in their very last semester??
how is there time left to do a capstone and departmental seminar
Oh, I finally stopped spinning
Somehow I got a class that had only. 20 seats available
They’ve been saying that forever tho
this is fair
Or someone in baha
I know someone in cwru baja
He’s not on this server though
I need a Newport
Don’t say shit you’re from North Carolina
doesnt seem to be a case student from what i can see
omg i had a layover in charlotte last weekend
I saw a decent number of case students at Cle’s airport today
Damn that’s where I live
Flew into Orlando last night
Oh gotcha I couldn’t remember if you lived in Raleigh or Charlotte
It was either Florida or I stayed back home for a chunk of winter break
I don't remember school sucking this much last semester
Honestly I feel like if they didn’t call one already they probably won’t?
Idk I also don’t wanna do clinicals tomorrow :lmfno:
@everyone lmk if you want a cal invite. For those already invited, remember to RSVP on google cal

oh damn
hm idk what to think tbh
RIP sanity
tried relish for the first time
i only had ketchup and mustard as options in school
was never offered relish
Fair enough
i... have never had relish either
Girl you didn’t not see what happened after y’all left
isnt it like pickle sauce
@jujulb @sprinkles2108 WE NEED TO HANG OUT SOMETIME I MISSED YALL SO MUCH
What happened
You don’t wanna know
I’m telling you you don’t wanna know
We need to cancel those creatures frfr
Um no I wasn't?
upb getting a budget cut lmao
rip
gonna miss the free stuff
besides them having a lot of money already
I really don't care if Case starts using their own whatever, but given that Bon Appetit is involved, I dunno if I trust it to work half the time
What'll probably happen is they'll roll out the system, but the sheer volume of users will overwhelm it, causing lost orders and mass confusion
Oh damn
coming at y'all with another thing I need to sell, if anyone is looking for a MIDI Fighter 3D, hmu

That’s scary
I know their are various application openings right now, I am wondering when those applications close and hiring forms are sent
its usually over the summer i think, depends on the prof tho
they really waited for students to leave to really go absolutely insane, thats 3 alerts within the week
seniors r still on campus 😵‍💫
bye seth the scammer
wow, her manager must hate her if shes being forced to go to ohio
It won’t let me post in the roommates server but are any grad students looking for housing? I have one room left walking distance to campus

How long was the flight
So doesn’t warrant this level of kick back
on the other hand, if it were a long flight, you would've had to deal with it for long 💀
Did they get literally any input from faculty/students before doin this shit
They changed everything for the worse! They thought beyond the possible!!
wtf
is that shit

"As for the tertiary colors—among them violet purple, terracotta orange and vivid green"

let’s just hope that god awful logo isn’t on our degrees
I will kill myself in front of Eric Kaler to forever alter his life
it really is
didn't the same thing happen with the president who got fired for making the "fat dude with a surfboard"?
something similar, but that stuck around for a good bit aswell
bruh that’s some stupid shit
Its also worse than you think. The old font was custom designed for us and costed a decent penny
As soon as the rumors that kaler was leaving were gone, we got this shit
Why can't this school have competent admin?
She is also very disappointed as a boomer parent
Mom also cooked up a crack theory that this was a covert move to have an excuse to remove the "est. 1849" date given it's close connotations to the civil war era and that liberal schools are moving to "history-wash" 💀💀💀
Controversial take but the new logo isn’t that bad
Don’t hate us cause you ain’t us🙄🙄
It’s ok tho I understand not everyone has what it takes to major in business
couldn’t he just make a building instead
he’s not agnar pytte and he never will be 🙄
I incorporated the venerable titillium into the  logo, turned the sunburst -45 degrees to harken back to that CWRU icon, and darkened the blue a bit to make it more sophisticated while still being findable in a crowd of logos
Some of you might recognize this from my Instagram; I took that post down to add some revisions and also to avoid false copyright infringement accusations. Although I got permission from the university to use the svg of the new four-line to make my own take on a redesign, I highly doubt everyone at CWRU's marketing and legal departments are on the same page, and I didn't want to deal with the hassle.
god the official ones suck
I've heard rumors that Kaler's wife hated the navy blue and wanted it changed
And they're already in the process of changing the jerseys to match
well, given it feels like they just told an intern do to it in 5min
Crazy how these all look better and u didn’t change much
I showed the school of medicine one to my boss and his jaw dropped and he said, "holy shit, that looks so much better, wow"
can't get the jepoardy theme out of my head when looking at the new logo now
2nd one with the school of medicine hella clean, AND multipurpose, i like it
Hold up @howdy_. why are they complaining about being forced to use screensavers on their work computers, when cwru won't give me a computer in the first place?
its cuz you havent gotten your head in the game
you dont think they would try charging us for that
it's still blue what
still ugly as all hell
**BREAKING NEWS:** *The* Jolly Scholar found dead in his Florida mansion, Staff in a scramble to find his replacement
What was the cause of death?
uh oh…….
Smh adam trying to shift the blame
I wouldn't go to Florida to kill my worst enemy, not sure why y'all are blaming me
No I'm just implying I have high standards and people need to be accepting of them
So, ik that dunking on the new "logo" isnt anything new, but it came to my attention that apparently case "worked" with an actual design firm to produce this logo. "Throughout the process, Case Western Reserve collaborated with international design firm Pentagram"
if this is actually true, then even the design firm knows how shit the logo is, because they dont list it on their website https://www.pentagram.com/work/archive?abc=1&letter=C&page=2
I need to know if anyone is as deep into it as I am bc I’ve moved on from my obsession with the titan submersible and have pivoted to this

All is good, I just wanted the instructions
You got it wrong m8
Idk why everyone shits on JFK this place ain’t bad

If you have a VPN it should still work
I’m silly goofy and idk how to read u know that

it’s my least favorite airport that i have been to
welp, rip GH and gh+
so close yet so far
No, if one more person asks me what I’m gonna do post grad I’ll cry
I applied to grad school last week and it’s scary
makes u feel old
I fell to my knees like this when one of my friends told me that today
i feel really old now goddam
yea, it seems to have ignored engine and ears
like for things that could hazard the building (leaking dishwasher) pretty fast, but for things that arent working (stove burners) its been weeks
Just how I’d want it
oh my god I hate those flies
indeed, we dont make anoucements often, but kinda dont want to lose out on like all the fruits n stuff
I can’t add anymore
Got all the classes I needed except for anatomy 312 histology
anyone take PHYS 121 proficiency exam last year, can I dm ?
We are all seniors so my guess is most of us took that like 3-4 years ago :/
Hi guys, I have a slot in medieval robots (USNA Tue/Thu, 1:00PM to 2:15PM) but it doesn't work with my schedule. Does anyone have a USNA that works with this schedule and wants to swap?
wait i misread, nvm sorry i dont have one, carry on
maybe (I don't live on campus)
if you have like a car n stuff, the parking lot on southside is often empty in the evenings. If you need a car, there may be a driving school you can sign up with
oh no
thats crazy, they are turning bottom of the hill into study rooms
Where’d u find this
yeah see I don’t know how to read unfortunately
it's never too late
it’s never too late
Hey guys, I'm not sure if people read this anymore. I am a senior BME pre-med looking for someone to room with during my gap year in Cleveland from May 20, 2024 (graduation) onwards. Please let me know what your gap year plans are as well. Currently, I have PCNA at clinic and a potential R&D thing with my PI. Please dm me to know more if you're interested.

Hi yall, kind of a weird question, I graduated last year and have an unopened graduation cap and gown that was sent to me in the wrong size. Is it ok if I post about it here? I know this sort of thing would usually go on campusgroups but I can't access it anymore 😭
Sure, I don't think anyone will be upset at that lol
Opposite of upset for sure
No idea why they sent me a 6’3” to 6’5” one… If shipping to Cleveland then $20 venmo. Mostly I want to get rid of it 😂 Feel free to DM if interested!
aww shucks
never know until you try bud
I don’t understand
I was pretty sure that 8300 came after 8299 but I didn’t want to risk being the person who couldn’t count so I decided to check just in case
still available btw! I wont spam but in case you missed it
personally i don't trust the place in coventry the most. i've seen some people get some piercings that didn't turn out the greatest, but there are also lots of people that have good piercings from there
Does anyone who has taken the mcat have recommendations of study materials? What did u find useful/not useful? I don’t want to buy anything more than have to as many of the materials are pricey. Any information is appreciated. Thanks.
