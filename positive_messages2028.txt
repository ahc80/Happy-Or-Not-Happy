no way...
Ben how could you do this to me
q
Lol
>:(
power move
Lmaooo
Are any of you unroled people from the class of 28
Or have none of them made their way here yet
Yes
Absolutely lol
Right now weâ€™re all old
The Sophies are multiplying
hello :D
Why are there 2 sci-fi obsessed Sophies who know/want to know German who let this happen
@reddishlightning what's with your need to make moderators a crimson red?
Can I be mod
on foe Iâ€™m moderate dis@shit
on twizzy
oh my god yes exactly why? not even good red
This is the best red (out of the presets available)
Pale orange-y red << Crimson red
we're actually one person scamming everyone for years
mm true. but like any color>>> red
So true actually
I wonder if Sophie von Coelln can dance
Do y'all prefer having a gradient for the colors of different years or more contrasting ones
Gradient is what we have now
Gradient is p good I like this color
please
Or better yet
No specific mod color?
Ooh nice
hiding amongst the people
Update I have confirmed Sophie vc is not dance. However, if you end up coming to case I will organize a dance off
god no
lol
on that note, gotta go get ready for dance
Godspeed
danced 👍
surprised at the amount of activity here

Indeed
so true
My prediction is that this server dies in a week and when the flux of new members comes in in like 2 months, it will stay alive until like September
I joined the server in July-ish
It popped off but of course conversation moved out of the server and into real life
I also joined 27cord after the semester started
Lmao
That's a wonderful name
(community) + "cord" is a classic
If you ever get a personal server would it be Deskord
oh. might be a smash thing.
used to be part of the smash community and the main discords for every character would be
(character's name)-cord
but it's definitely not limited to that side of the internet
I actually do have a personal server and it is called Canrax
???
there's lore
don't worry about it
There's ~~lore~~ **etymology**
I shall not
there's both!
heyya!
Hi!! Omg a fellow korean nursing major

hehehehehehe
Yeah I guess so
ha! classic adam
Indeed
Adam Hutchings always lacking
no, 27cord just strong
another german speaker in our midst
The class of 28 is going to exclusively speak German
â€¦nein
Best get learnin
Why does everyone here know German somehow
Iâ€™d honestly love to learn German at some point
Ich auch aber es gibt noch viele andere
Seems like a fun language
i think interacting with sophie (vc) so much os gonna make me pick up some german
Ik ben Nederlands aan het leren
learning dutch will also help esp since i chime in with frequency when a dutch word is similar to a german one
Inderdaad
me next semester
Ja, es ist sehr toll
Nice username 😂
Thanks 😂
I came up with it when I was like 11 and thought it was the best thing ever
Discord at 11? Sounds like a violation of the TOS 👮â€â™€ï¸ 🚨
:o I just told on myself
🚔🚔🚔
Well statute of limitations and all
jawohl
Time to speak German everyone! 🥰
so true!! can pick up words of dutch bc german
Wast sind deinem Leiblingsfach ins den Schuelen?
See everyone? German is fun!
me when
lmao
Ich finde das schlecht
Ich auch
Ziemlich nicht gut wÃ¼rd ich sagen
was denn?
HÃ¶rt sich nach SpaÃŸ an
Warum lernt ihr deutsch das ist ne ganz seltsame Fremdsprache
ist keine Fremdsprache fÃ¼r mich
Echt
Kommst du aus Deutschland
Es ist fÃ¼r mich Fremdsprache aber ich habe in Berlin gewohnt
Deshalb kann ich Deutsch
bin halb Koreanisch halb Deutsch
Ich liebe es. Es ist keine Fremdsprache
Warst du ein austauschschÃ¼ler beim AATG
Auch, mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut. Es tut mir leid 😭
Nee, ich bin mit meiner Familie gegangen
same
Ich auch aber ich muss mein Deutsch wegen der AP-PrÃ¼fung verbessern
😭
es gibt ap deutsch?
Jawohl
Vielen Danke. Wir sind im selben Boot. 💀
ich war in deutschland geboren
auch keine fremdsprache fÃ¼r mich
Oh das ist so cool
I decided I would learn grammar first and then vocabulary which was not the best idea in the whole world
together we make one functional german speaker
LET'S GO
i speak like im from the new jersey of germany
Wo in Deutschland? Wenn es Ihnen nichts ausmacht, wenn ich frage
I speak like I am a very confused American foreigner in Germany (I just speak English)
Du kommst aus Berlin??? 😊
Just kidding I have no idea what the NJ of Germany is
lmaooo
no im from sachsen
Bayern maybe? 💀
Aus Berlin 🤨
Disgusting
BAYERN 😍😍😍
Als ich in Deutschland war hab ich in Bayern gewohnt
My love 🥰🥰🥰
How is the Currywurst there
Very relevant factor imo
Wie ist das Bier?
mmmm currywurst
Das beste in der ganzen Welt
Verdammt, ich muss es versuchen!
(bitte benutz "du" fÃ¼r mich) ich war in tÃ¼bingen geboren aber meine familie wohnt in dÃ¼sseldorf
Probieren eigentlich 🙄
In diesem Server kÃ¶nnen wir alle sietzen 🥰
/s of course
Bro went â€œand perhaps may I inquire as to where in Germany my noble ladyâ€
😭
😭
new server policy: formal you ONLY. thank you for this decree lord hutchings
Of Course! I'm Glad We're All On The Same Page Here!
We are a Sie/Usted/Vouz/æ‚¨ community
Hello, how do I change my name?
You can right-click on your name and select "Change Nickname"
Or if you want, you can tell me what you want your name to be and I can set it for you
Thank you, I appreciate it.
found it
Are you an incoming student?
Yes I am 🙂
Welcome! People are speaking German right now for reasons beyond my understanding
FÃ¼r SpaÃŸ 😂
(I fully well know why I contributed to it)
Lucky
je ne comprends pas l'allemand... aidez-moi s'il vous plaÃ®t
je parle en peux francais
moi aussi
I'll be typing and suddenly "yeah I had a pretty Good Day Today, I Went To Class ..."
Je ne parle Francais
Ich auch. Es ist sehr Hilfreich
Lo entiendo pq hablo espaÃ±ol pero no le puedo escribir
Or is it something something pas
"je ne parle pas franÃ§ais"
yo tambien. estudio espanol en la escuela pero tengo familia en francia
booo
oh god Spanish now? lol
Do you just know 4 languages
i speak a lot of things
im learning korean
and am a casual tolkien elvish enthusiast
Vivo en un barrio con mucha gente de la rd y de pr
Dang I only have English and partially German under my belt
Hay alguien que hable cantonÃ©s?
ooh which one?
I was looking into Sindarin because the friend group watch partied LOTR recently
know some isolated words of sindarin but am looking more into quenya grammar right now bc its like learning latin
aka theres a lot of influence in sindarin
yessir
👁ï¸
well I'm in to crazy nerd shit lol
do it!!!!!!
(i have a conlang)
yeees!!
@mistyphie and I pop off
Ope you beat me to it
I used to have a Discord server for one of my conlangs
2019 was a wild time
yorisje
Unfathomably based
How was everyone's week?
irrationally busy
Yeah I get it
What were you up to?
Or what weren't you up to 💀
Looks like everyone was busy
Dude I had so many tests this week on top of a summative project for English
It was so dumb
my brothers school does midterms right after winter break. could be a similar system
Not entirely sure why our schedule is like that
so does mine. its ass
hello guys
hiya
Hullo
Is that aerospace engineering and dance, Sophie? I respect the grind but that's pretty intense
Hello
yessir :) im insane
but im used to crazy dance schedules
Wouldn't that be like 150 credits to graduate?
i mean like i dance 12-15 hours a week now in a pre-pro studio, and i wanna kinda keep that level of intensity
Dance + something else is usually doable, but AE is the type of major that wants to occupy pretty much all your time. I've only ever heard of AE doubling up with meche
I do know of some theater/other engineering majors, but they're kinda crazy with it
yeah im prob gonna do the ae/meche
Triple major would be kind of insane lmao
objectively better number than 29 at least
Would have been fun but I was fast asleep
Anyone watch the Chiefs-Ravens game?
Some of it
@cygnusxxii
Man that was such a rough game to watch
😭
Flowers fumble then Lamar's interception
Moral of the story: donâ€™t wait 10 seconds to throw the ball
Yeah but the Chiefs defense was on the Ravens the whole time
Moral of the story: despite being based on Edgar Allen Poe, Baltimore stays losing :(
Whoâ€™s gonna win NFC?
My heart is telling me the Lions
Thatâ€™d be wild
It would be a wonderful Cinderella story if they beat the 49er's and the Chiefs to win the SB
Absolutely incredible script
Iâ€™ve learned Usher is headlining the halftime show
Everyone loses the superbowl
He is
They announced it during the game
Yeah that's most likely what is going to happen
The real football was the friends we made along the way (I donâ€™t follow football really Iâ€™ll watch the superbowl though)
How many times has Mahomes won, like 3?
yep :(
shhhh im from baltimore
Iâ€™m from south-central PA, so around here people are split between the Steelers, Eagles and Ravens
Please say youâ€™re not an eagles fan
🫡👍
I love sports!
i keep forgetting they named the Washington Football Team
Honestly Iâ€™m not into any specific team, I just like watching the sport for the heck of it
my dads a sports guy. ergo i have grown up with sports
I'd say calling the Commanders a name is a bit of a stretch
he likes very niche sports tho so ask me about ski jumping any time
Yo that shitâ€™s wild
thats hilarious
i respect that
hes consistent
How about curling?
oh yeah
again, im from baltimore(harbor city. disgusting water) and one time i saw people like actually in the water there
🤮
10 bucks the water has cholera in it
Iâ€™ll raise you to 100
Too rich for my blood
hashtag harbor swimmable by 2024 !
💵💵💵💵
Near me, the Susquehanna River is pretty gross
And it floods all the time 🤮
Like I've heard nothing good of the Hudson at all
I mean Harrisburg itself is pretty disgusting
Denver has good rivers near it but also itâ€™s Denver so itâ€™s not like the east coast Industrial City Rivers that have had people throwing trash and oil in them for the last 200 years
Ah yeah
Lions TD in the first 2 minutes is crazy
i think any river is pretty disgusting
a lot of cities also put sewage into them up until some point
any of yall listen to indie folk kpop or jazz?
theyre separate lol
its indie folk, kpop, or jazz
indie folk could be in any language
Indie folk could be a genre, but I think both of those are xor with kpop
I've listened to a little bit of indie and folk sorts of stuff, but I probably can't name a ton of bands or songs
I am a big metalhead, with an eclectic assortment of other things
I listen to some indie and I had a very short kpop phase
Personally, I believe my music taste is the most correct and it's everyone else who must be mistaken
i need to listen to more kpop
👀
ateez on top
i played kami no kotoba once and they took me out back
lmaooo
funnier bc boba is originally taiwanese
boba shop barista gang real
gang gang
hey any taiwanese people in chat? you should join TASA next semester, half the people who come to our meetings aren't even taiwanese 😭
The Asians
free her
she was right
she would know how the asians make it
Itâ€™s true I was the lady and then everyone clapped
can confirm, i was the boba
can confirm, i was the barista that remade her drink 4 times
Oh god thatâ€™s
Yikes
i had an old lady come in and ask for a sugarless ginger tea
ok, cool, we'll make it with no sugar
she says it tastes like sugar
??
we had a crunchy granola mom and her daughter come in and ask for a tea with no ice. no problem people ask for that all the time.
and shes like "oh thats okay! unless you guys know what kind of water filter you use"
Lol
i had these two women walk in and order some pretty custom drinks
and we have this policy of not handing over drinks before we seal them because that's just like standard right
well one of the baristas seal the drink and turn around and the customers start freaking out because we "ruined it"
but the seal is the best part
and so finally the manager is like "alright fine just remake the drink it's not worth it"
so we remake the drinks
THESE GUYS
WHAT
What do they gain by this
THEY DIDNmt take THE DRINKT
Did u get to eat it
b r u h
Question about this policy
If I got a water would you seal it
Cause I think that would be really funny
but that's because you could easily just get another cup of water
basically it's like
if something happens before a drink is sealed, it's on us
Ah gotcha
so we try to have them sealed so that no spills happen right out the gate
that wouldn't have mattered
ill never forget this one middle school kid
bright white brand new hoodie
stabbed his raspberry tea with too much force
i still remember the look of pure horror on his face as the entire drink stained it bright pink
noooooooo
i remember once when a new team member came aboard, I randomly noticed that she stirred clockwise
and this sparked a year long tradition of betting on if the new hires would stir clockwise or counterclockwise
i'm sure it was more than a little intimidating because they'd be learning how to make drinks and like everyone else would lean in to watch at the same time HAHAHAHA
Whatâ€™s the right direction to stir :0
counter and i will stand by that
Lol if I work in the industry I will remember this 🫡
another victim let's go let's go let's go let's go let's g
i wonder if it relates to which hand youre using to stir? stirring clockwise with my right hand feels rlly weird
I think most people naturally follow the curve of their fingers when stirring
oh that makes a lot of sense
stir inwards yeah
oh it does but I know right handers who stir clockwise
💀
u can use ur hands lol
my sense of direction is immaculate
real!
or other way around
happens lmao
okay guys we need a 10th for among us, anyoen down?
Another beautiful day at Case (it will be 56 degrees Fahrenheit later this week)
Can't wait for the warmth of 56 F
eww no can it stay in the 30s please
fish youre insane
Compromise on 30 C?
vetoed
i think instead of using celsius/fahrenheit we should use kelvin but with temperature zones depending on your latitude
I think we should use Joules to measure absolute heat instead of some silly system like temperature
so true!!!!
compromise on 30 k. i promise no one will be complaining then!
A tad chilly
That is quite true
i wouldnt have to take my physics test
i support this
🤝
only in ohio
To say I was bamboozled would be an overstatement
see this is rlly funny bc i'm from maryland where we say like the same thing
Iâ€™m from Denver where it can just be 70 in January and then -5 the next day
In California, only in the spring
Else you have days of warning
And if you've been in the area for a while you can get the feel for when storms are coming around a week in advance
Because storms roll in from the ocean, in California the sunsets change color around a week before a storm
But in the spring absolutely all bets are off
in california we are right next to a typhoon 🤩
chill to the bone 💀💀
a bot?
looks like it
Lmao
Mods, Ban him
Got it 👍
SoCal or NorCal
The real bots were the friends we made along the way
norcal!
more like no cal am i right east coast beast coast
👁ï¸👁ï¸
Okay good
Bay Area?
all of you are lake shore now
howd u know?
every third case student is bay area
how many dmv kids do you have
Because no NorCal kids are from the cool part of NorCal
dmv kids?
😭
Out of curiosity where in the Bay
east
like
I used to live in the East Bay
south of walnut creek
I see
I used to live in Berkeley but I moved to the more based part of Cali
ohh i see
Sacramento area for the win 😎😎😎
We call it Sac too sometimes
so sacramento it is
lol
???
we call it sf/sfo
Fr
never full name
or half
cal took over
Fr
@maybe.ilikepink CWRU your beloved is that so
indeed
🤨
🙂
What year are you
'28 accepted but not enrolled
😔
Very nice
Are you planning to enroll though
thank you
undecided for now
Ah swag welcome
will be going into nursing if i do
so thats good
weâ€™re rich in local hospitals
Waiting on other decisions? Or financial stuff
where are you from again
other decisions yes
idrc about the distance
Las Vegas
I hope you get the decisions that will make you the happiest!
I recall college decision season being quite stressful
at least cwru is close to cleveland
It's in the middle of Cleveland lol
huh. would not have guessed this
Very much in the city
yeah cwru is very much in cleveland
hmmmmâ€¦is it iowa?
Vegas is west coast ish
yeah but like i wouldnâ€™t have thought vegas specifically
also that yeah
Yes!!! 🥰 👍 🌽 👨â€🌾 🚜
oh good
See on the other hand I thought suburbs were fine but I surprisingly liked it here a good amount
nothing within 5 min walk vicinity
Uh there is LOTS
bro im so looking forward to jazz scene in cleveland
There is a lot to do around campus, and your options open up even more if you're willing to take the bus/train or have a friend with a car
Art museum (multiple actually), concert hall (again multiple), and also good transportation system for the non-nearby things
in the suburbs here its "what's jazz?"
🐝 🎥 ?
AND GOOD TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM GOD FUCK 😭
i see a bus every hour maybe
give or take
Like basically on campus is performing arts centers, a concert hall, several museums, gardens, etc.
So real
Ah welp might be a bit too biased since im close to nyc
I mean, it's not NYC lol
But it's a good mid-sized urban area
i loved nyc
minus the smell
Like the friggin cars are always honking so aggressively
(This is a hot take ikik)
We also have a pretty active campus in terms of student life
yk what came in my mail today lol
i wanna find a d&d club
do u guys have one
We have an RPG club
And people mostly play DND
SIIICK
There's also a distinct tabletop games club
gaming of many varieties is alive and well here at the case western reserve university (shine on forever)
cwru sent me
a thick stack of postcards(?)
with photos w campus life
but i had to imagine like what if
I thought their welcome package was cute
they used that money to add onto my scholarship maybe?
lol
oh i agree
but like
Oh yeah i got that too! Pretty but totally useless
sending this stuff all the way over here is expensive asf
better than nothing
there are Fun Facts about the school on them actually 🤓â˜ï¸
A lot of people I know at case are here in part due to generous financial aid
they are generous yea
but
they could be even more generous
right?
Erm actually 🤓 ive been a case simp for so long i knew most :D
like okay iâ€™m sure itâ€™s expensive to send everyone post cards and a cinch sack or whatever but itâ€™s gotta be minimal relative to their scholarship budget
Lol. I'd rather they made tuition cheaper
oh thats tru
i say this as someone who knows nothing about how any of this works
trueee
why is tuition so expensive?
like
no
I think my class might have been the biggest of all time. Major over enrollment of 26ers definitely contributed to the housing crisis
Base tuition being expensive subsidizes financial aid for others more or less
the glaring 😭
every system has its pros and cons BUT
some better than others
take for instance
singapore
or south korea (university and up)
Ngl I am a simp for a good liberal arts education
its fun when u have a good teacher
Affordable college in many parts of Europe often comes with aggressive weeding out of people to make sure most people cannot go to college 😭
well
not enough
rly?
Yeah, for example, in Germany. There are three different types of schools people are sorted into that determine if they can get the opportunity for college, become a working professional, or just learn a trade or do low skilled jobs
It's technically possible to move up, but very challenging
So if you do poorly in secondary school . . . You're probably not going to a university
26 and 27 are both roughly 1550, 25 is 1600, 24 is 1300
And you have to meet very specific standards to get into each degree, depending on how many people they're willing to take and how high demand it is (from my understanding)
before co25 they were enrolling roughly 1300 a year and now itâ€™s high 1500s average 💀
Okay I stand corrected
well
its like
twice as big as my high school
fourth?????
yeah
for the gym???
FOURTH??
fourth is crazy
Anywhey, it's late and I'm eepy. Goodnight my fellows
byeee
yeah itâ€™s bed time i have class tomorrow morning
ew morning classes
good night!
thats real. i would go for grad school
One of my HS friends went to German university but she might've done extra requirements or been a special case idk
i mean you can. ifaik youd have to take the abitur tests though
International reqs also differ sometimes
Like for the UK, AP tests or whatnot can replace A levels
Regardless, welcome everyone! Y'all are gonna love it here.
That's sure to be crazy
When thousands of people get their case acceptances
Fr
Also @tyrannosaurus.rex are you class of 26 or 27
Well '27 in his name does indicate something
Clearly a 26er
I wrote my name as '27 because it felt more appropriate given the context of this server
Yea Iâ€™d be a sophomore lol
@Moderator ban
done
Toby with the fox pfp in the 2028 discord server? 👀
OwO 🦊
:furthinking:
!?
What
Oops
That's a tomorrow problem
Lol
preferably discrete
but like
graph theory / number theory is so fun tho
@kgir06 did someone say classics.
lol which authors do you like
@makerofmemes Catullus mentioned!
Ooooh I havenâ€™t read much of Catullus but I love all the Latin poets
yeaaa, my latin class is on its catullus grind, and so far hes my favorite
martial is a bit boring, but maybe thats just the poems weve done
thats so real
hes so funny
its not as good as it seems trust me
Oh no lol! Are you â€œlearningâ€ Latin or reading translations?
catullus is just a funny lil guy
I love the silly lil guys of history
It was lit
This is crazy
Hello Oscar Art History Twenty Five
Bme and classics is a crazy combo
But good luck
Prof. Singer does number theory, crypto, and geometry
I love that man
I am a chronically impulsive person o7
Lol I mean if you're committed you can do a lot
But that would be very intense
Iâ€™ll probably go for a minor in classics but weâ€™ll see
im so excited for college math classes lmao
yea im thinking about that lol
100% agree
For me yes I love learning, but you can get into industry pretty quickly with it. Finance/business and engineering/cs both like math majors Iâ€™m p sure
Grad school yes
Or quantitative finance and make hella bank
Very cool
We'll see though
Which part of CS are you interested in?
I would say AI because it's kinda cool but that's a basic boy answer
Please
So I'll say quantum computing because it's a very mathy field
And I think it's really cool
Ooooh that is far less basic lol
The part that is being a fucking NERD from CALIFORNIA @reddishlightning
You ALL live up to the CWRU nerd reputation
Itâ€™s great
Everyoneâ€™s a nerd here yea which means I get to call everyone a nerd
You're calling *me* a nerd?!
You said a linear algebra midterm was *fun*.
It was!
youre both insane
||Okay well yes I agree BUT STILL||
They're fine
Wha
Oscar probably joined the server just to shitpost
🧢
Did it actually 💀
girl yes
As is everything at Case
Ditto it is scary to see a message like that
Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re here to reaffirm them kids 😁👍🏼
shine on 👍
🫡🫡🫡
(This message is sponsored by president Eric Kaler)
Oh and Iâ€™ll be moving these kids in on move in day
Same!
Along with the other greek orgs
Bro last semesterâ€™s move in
These parents r something else
Presumably I will too
Mfs brought an almost full size fridge and packed that ho up and taped it shut and I had to carry it up flights of stairs💀
💀
Bro did you see how backed up they were😭😭
Lines going outside of the building is actually insane
What dorms were you doing
I did Mistletoe and it was fine
I was doing Juniper
And I was in juniper freshman yr
Junifam
💀💀
Yuh
slay
Huge actually
Yes, itâ€™s mandatory that you go move if you move into your house a week early
Or else you get charged
Like the trade off is that
Ye
Get good at probability, â€œsell outâ€, and become a quant earning 6 figured straight out of undergrad
Probability my beloathed
Earn 7 figures by 30
ohh i see
my backup plan
@roguish_raven #introductions
I hath done so noweth
Poggers
Anyways duh dew

What did you just realize


That's a lot money per student
I could get a lot with $179,329.563151 dollars
wdym
$179,329 can buy a lot of robux
$179,329 can fund all of my delusions 🛐
God dam
that's about 7k per student at the previous calculation
and then you also have faculty & staff and such
I'm going to make up with no justification that if we as a student body vote in the majority, we can access all of the endowment at once
I made that figure up off of what I know folks use as a rough barometer for living off of investments, very possible that number could be higher. That was just a like number I threw together to showcase that not all of it is accessible all at once and if you wanna maintain, you have to live on dividends to some extent.
probably higher than 4% I just forget the specific number I've seen of what percentage of an endowment can be spent year over year
Hi new people
Nice
happy late Pi day. i love apple pie, pumpkin pie, and
PI (Principal Investigator)
The day inches ever closer that the regular decision students get admitted
Hold the line!
i think im going to commit to cwru!
chances are highly likely
That day is today I'm pretty sure
💀
lmao lots of new ppl joining
Apprehensive or anxious about my decision cause I was 100% certain I was getting waitlisted at best
Then I got in :lmao:
Well congrats dude!
ooooh nice job! 🙌
Nice!
congrats!!
anyone here on the premed/predental track?
yo! 👁ï¸ 👁ï¸ 
im basically pre-med
Yeah I think Iâ€™m also going to commit to CWRU
Omg new people hi
CWRU is definitely more known for premed and the like than it is for what I applied to being cs but as far as I'm aware it's still very good for that so
CS at case is solid for sure. Is that ur preferred major atm?
Yeah I'm honestly surprised I got in
yeh unless you're a nursing student i think?
Source: admitted for math/CS/physics whatnot and am now math/english
Yeah the nursing students are locked into their major I think
yeah nursing and music are the only majors you have to apply to
although music you can audition in during your first semester
Only music performance right?
My SAI is -1500 so my css profile probably reflected something similar to that too
ik someone who auditioned into music ed his first semester
low income
Case meets full demonstrated need (with loans) so
Oh look who it is
:mike_stare:
Fancy meeting you here
You can always reach out to the finaid office and see
cus i was not done justice as a low income international student😭
im pretty sure you can have them reevaluate if your situation changes also
Whatâ€™s the tea lol
We're both in the a2c discord I talked to them a decent amount about case
Californian ass statement
yeahh id really like that. thanks for offering
And then I did so they were right
:catstand:
Case has a way of surprising people. I was sure I wasnâ€™t gonna get in
help 😭😭😭
And then oops! Acceptance letter jump scare!
I do recommend it here the people are quite swag
But I am biased
Being an international student is rough
If the cost they gave you seems prohibitively high compared to your assets, try appealing
I sent them an email about this
real.
i just hope the financial aid office considers my case
pun intended😂
cause my cost of attendance atm is so high😭
Expect your expected financial contribution to stay the same throughout all four years
Unless your family's situation changes significantly
There are some external and internal scholarships you can get later though
Especially from case alumni association
sure thing👍
how can I get some
from the fafsa stuff
idk if thats a good idea
If not, take the federal loans
They are much more reasonable than private loans
I think I was nominated to get a sophomore scholarship, but I applied for a junior/senior one
cool! I'm just wondering. what are the required courses for the premed track?
and also, how common is it for people to major in some field in the humanities while doing premed?
ty in advance
In general, the answer for â€œhow common is it for people to [insane combination/collection of majors]â€ is â€œvery common, or at least very doableâ€
https://case.edu/studentlife/careercenter/graduate-and-professional-school-planningpre-health-advising/medicine
I know more than one who is
Pretty much everyone is doing at least a major and a minor
There are definitely some people who only do one thing, but a lot of them are majoring in something like engineering or CS
Most social sciences or humanities majors have enough space for a lot more content
the link @cawu posted earlier gives an overview of course requirements:
2 semesters of inorganic chemistry with lab (likely CHEM 105, 106, and 113)
2 semesters of organic chemistry with lab (likely CHEM 223, 224, 232, and 233)
3 (likely BIOL 214, 215, and 216) to 4 semesters of biology with lab (can choose two from BIOL 214L, 215L, and 216L usually)
2 semesters of physics with lab (likely PHYS 115 and 116)
1 semester of biochemistry (likely BIOC 307, BIOC 308 or CHEM 328)
2 semesters of English composition
1 to 2 semesters of quantitative coursework ( calculus and/or statistics (likely STAT 201, PSCL 282, or ANTH 319) )
1 to 2 semesters of behavioral sciences (likely PSCL 101 or SOCI 101)
very ***very*** common~
take myself for example, majoring in CS minoring in econ and also premed 🥹 
it's doable, maybe not sustainable
Not sure yet to be honest
I was boutta say am I gonna be expected to take a minor 😭
😧
Nah, but it's honestly pretty easy to mix and match subjects
Which is funny cause one of my other acceptances was a cs and ai dual major but I digress
Follow your dreams
I have a friend (not at case) named Red who does computer science. I think she interns for some ai company
https://tenor.com/view/indecisive-decisions-no-yes-the-grinch-gif-16695781
I was interested in ai before the whole
Everything is ai craze currently
But I was too young to rly do anything about it
I was into it before it was cool smh
Now I'm about to have to compete
With EVERYBODY
If only I was born in like 2004

We are screwed too homie
Hi there
Itâ€™s not much better
well in the context of AI if I was born in 0'4 it'd be a lot easier than I imagine it will be in 2 years
So you can get a job before the recession
But who cares
:painharold:
If it works, then CS and something else is possible
Some people enjoy the 6 or 7 class grindset (Adam for example) but it's not an expectation that you subject yourself to that
Yea
Freshman forgiveness is nice but imo it's better if you don't need to use it
CS BS is 20 classes 😭
You just gotta stay on track
question on this actually. do you mean 15-16 academic credits or are you including ensembles with this
I mean 15-16 academic credits
Ha ha! Who would ever do something so foolish? (Slaughter me now â€¦)
to any freshmen reading this donâ€™t worry youâ€™ll be fine maybe just donâ€™t do 3 ensembles 💀
Blink twice for help
Classical mechanics
Martens is super nice!
But with everything I had going on, I was just constantly doing less than my best in every class
yeah thatâ€™s a lot
Plus the ensemble and clubs and executive positions
Sometimes we take the W
Class of [YEAR] roles are for the year youâ€™re planning to graduate from college, not high school
So if youâ€™ve just been admitted to Case youâ€™re probably class of 28
why is tuition so fking expensive hello r there ways to get more aid 😭
My advice is to apply for as many scholarships as you can - try local ones around your hometown that have less compitition. If you get lucky with scholarships you can get a couple thousand off the tuition price. There are case specific scholarships, some offer full tuition others offer full ride but those are extreeeeeemely competitive, worth a shot though. You can also appeal financial aid decisions though I don't really know how that works.
If anyoneâ€™s at Case right now howâ€™s the weather looking
I roll up at 6 AM and could check my weather app but it has deceived me one too many times
like
in terms of mood swings
it was 60 one morning and snowed that afternoon
a bit rainy but fine tbh
No idea where you are in CA but where I am the weather is stable almost always
in the bay area
its 38 and 70 the same day
oh good
where i live i wear a puffer and a tank top-
yeah thats fine

eek
Yup
15+ degree difference
July where I am averages more than 40 degrees difference over a day
ayy
okay
Cool cool
Glad I have an Ohioan to let me know what it is right now
Also you can take the Californian out of California but you can NEVER take the California out of the Californian
when does fall sem usually start
https://case.edu/registrar/dates-deadlines/academic-calendar
realâ€¼ï¸
slay thank you! and yeah that seems rough 😭
humanities girlies stay winning 
(we're gonna be unemployed)
why are there so many of yâ€™all
At least Iâ€™m not from the coast
That makes it better at least right
True
but NYCers > everyone but californians > californians
Is anyone here Mech E, i'd love to know more about the programs at case and your experience in that major
@yutayuta567 ?
i think they are in the same position as me lol
Well he's flaired as Class of 2024 so I assumed a current senior
lol
boooo
Inland Californians > Bay Area > S*cal
I'll go see if I can poke a couple of my meche friends and see if they'll give a statment
alright thanks â™¥ï¸
is socal a slur 😭
no... adam is just being adamself
"Adamself" 💀
how else would you like me to describe you sir adam?
can agree on socal
cencal>>>>>>
YESS
Y'all think cwru would rescind me for a C
English 102 is kicking my *ass*
One C is probably fine tbh. If it drops to a D or F Iâ€™d be concerned but a single C is fine especially if you can bring it up to a B
so probably not
Yeah I've been going through Reddit posts of people taking about cwru rescindences
And the only person who ACTUALLY got rescinded had like 2 Ds and a c
So I'm just gonna have to pray atp 😭
praying for you 🙏
Defintely don't want to say anything for sure, but usually they look at the record they admitted you for and then your record from there and if it isn't a huge drop (so one C is probably fine) you're good. Again, this is just what I think, not for sure
Case reddit is very toxic. People mostly go there just with negative news, imo it's not that useful
Yea. Keep in mind everyone here is a student, not admissions or admin staff, so really specific questions regarding you in particular can be tough for us to answer
I think you'll be fine. I had a good few C's in HS, most in my upperclassman (junior, mostly) years.
:(
🪃
I'm touring CWRU in a few weeks, but from a student perspective how safe is the campus?
its been a lot better this year
i remember previous years there would be numerous incident reports but this year there's been at most one traffic incident
campus is well-lit and there are emergency buttons along every sidewalk
if you are feeling unsafe, you can book a safe ride or ask for a walking escort
Alright thank you
Hi guys I have a question for anyone that can answer it. So I got 26,500 a year merit scholarships. I for sure know my family will not get anything from fafsa but case is still insanely expensive for me to pay. Does anyone have experience negotiating with the financial aid office to see if they would give more scholarships?
aah i see! yeah it's a famous uni for exchange/study abroad programs. and you're in a perfect location then! hope u have funnnn
It's so over for me
yayy thats exciting to hear! where is your school?
This is so real 😭😭
I might regret asking this but what is JJK
I keep hearing people talking about it
Jujutsu Kaisen. Anime.
😨
like one of the best animes out there rn
animation, characters, story are all really good
https://tenor.com/view/kenjaku-suguru-geto-surprised-cat-jujutsu-kaisen-gif-14583623906303270638
you can turn your brain off and just watch the fight scenes, or put in the effort to understand the story. either way, it's very rewarding
chainsaw man is also peak!!
https://tenor.com/view/nayuta-chainsaw-man-makima-denji-yuh-uh-gif-10769256875524943355
Considering how few incidences there have been, CWRU is very safe, and honestly the people who you should be most afraid of are the awkward students and Eric Kaler who is robbing you of +50k annually
erm
honestly i live in LA, there is def more stuff that goes on around me
idek why i'm judging
did anyone apply for any case tuition scholarships?
or has anyone received one?
i got the uni grant!
if that counts
scholarship*
Yeah I think uni grant is just whenever you apply you get a set amount
Like one of my friends got 10k (still waiting for a music one too), 26k, and 35k
Knowledge
shoutouts to the guy dodging every single picnic table all the way from mistletoe up to the pavilion but somehow managing to crash into the big static in your face pavilion
Especially in stem
how strong is the Japanese community at CWRU?
^I would like to know as well
they have a sizable light infantry battalion (Tsunagari Japan) supplemented with a light-armored reconnaissance (Kendo Club) and artillery regiment (JapanCase). jokes aside You'll definitely meet a lot of people just hanging out around campus, on their way to AsiaTown (waiting for shuttle), or at clubs that are more likely to attract certain ethnic or cultural groups.
weâ€™re truly honored to be the artillery 🫡
@pineappleapplepen another Californian!!!
Welcome, and if you have any questions about how it is to be at Case coming from Norcal, I woud be happy to help
But itâ€™s totally up to you
Airplanes are cool
https://fullcodemedical.com/
My mom's take on cwru
The campus is very safe though
crime is very concentrated and if you act with relative sanity you are very very unlikely to ever be victimized
But this is the same mother who constantly called me when I was on my state schools campus for a summer program being monitored like a hawk by the program counselors so
You point out the pepper spray but not the blade?? 😭
look the blade's barely sharper than a blunt tip walmart scissor blade 😭

My mom's starting to find some of those random niche rankings
"hidden ivy" bro what is that 😭
Guh
Ivy League was literally a sports league
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hidden=wannabe
the fact that case put that link on their website should speak for itself
it was rough
there was no room
ooo you came?
yep i was there!
Lol
I was at the Glee Club table in the very far corner
it was a bit overwhelming
it was very packed
Yeah it was pretty loud in there also
\:-/
they shlda had yall outside possibly
that woulda helped a bunch
Was there a club thing for admitted students day
ye
If I knew about that I wouldâ€™ve shown up and looked really confused to annoy my friends methinks
that sounds like a vibe
ive already committed so this was a way for me to meet ppl lol
How was your campus visit
loved it
Nice!
am gna live at thinkbox
I remember mine was
its been decided lmao
The thinkboxians
next 3 thursdays also!
o7
Huge
no.
I was going to say, if you're around campus tomorrow you should go check them out
If you need a guide I would be happy to show you but if not I can also just produce a random map
you don't need to declare a major for a bit and changing ur major is pretty easy. The only thing is the first year engineering courses are probably worth looking into if you're serious considering it
seconded
but ill try to get there early-ish? if that helps
my parents r prolly not gna come w
Jake and I will finish an obligation around 11:30
30 minutes will definitely be enough time
class ends at 11:25 are we just gonna give him the invite in the classroom
Probably lol
That's how I've done the other 4
sounds great! lemme know where to meet u lol
if you know where the sears library is, that's the ideal spot
Sears (not thinkbox) lobby perhaps?
uhhh
What places do you know the name of
wait ok
its across the physics building?
Sears is across from the physics building yes
cuz ik where that id
is
ok cool
we can meet at rock
Sears is where Jake and I will be
ok sounds good
Awesome sauce
See you then
is it usually open?
like the lobby
always
Oh yes absolutely
ok coolio
A few of them are keycard-locked but Sears is not one of them
ty bothâ€¦
look for the two absolute dweebs probably wearing OX letters(?) idk what I'm gonna wear tmrw I might pull out the damage shirt
Whoa whoa Jake let's not go pulling out the word dweeb
How dare you describe yourself as such
if you have trouble finding sears you can also search for the einstein bros on the quad, since that's in nord, which is right next to sears
we can just be in communication
sounds good! ty again
Seconded
I'm there tuesday :0
Awesome
Anything you'd like to see?
Otherwise I'd love to help
What else is cool? What are the must-see places
Rockefeller is nice (physics building)
I say Guilford house but that's just because its where I spend a lot of my time and its really nice
Hovorka Atrium is cool
@makerofmemes might have more ideas for your majors in particular
Most important places to see: Tink, Thwing, freshman dorms
Yes to all of the ones listed ^^
thwing was lit
they gave us cotton candy
thwing is a surprisingly cool space
What was your favorite thing you saw?
there's a ton of rooms you'd have no idea that exist in that building
thinkbox for sure
if u want pictures lemme know
Oh absolutely
I also have pictures of it!!! (From when I toured campus 2 years ago)
I'd love to see all campus pics!
Thwing and Tink are the main student hubs on campus. On the quad, Sears, Rock, and Nord are the mainstays in my head. The mather quad is surprisingly really cool too if you get the chance to poke your head in some of those buildings (guilford my beloved)
i wish i knew where the important things were (like which bathroom the dueling toilets and co-op toilets are in in rock)
the dueling toilets??
Wait I'm sorry what is a dueling toilet
thats what im wondering

and the co-op toilets
dueling
thats insane
HAHA
third floor rock i think
this i gotta see
unless its in the mens bathroom
I believe it is the men's
im unsure
the person who posted it currently identifies as male so yea prob the mens room
there are a number of campus cryptids like that though
and is co-op toilets like they both r in the same stall?
ok then
I think it may have been a story post on insta but I know the athenian (<3) did a couple polls about the best toilets on campus
â€¦
😳
the stuff i deal with
tink bathrooms slay
tink bathrooms are surprisingly good for being in such a crowded area. same for KSL
I wasnt planning to go to the admitted students event cause i already committed but u guys r making it sound real fun
bro it was a vibe
specifically the social they hold
And if y'all need or want it I am always happy to show people around provided I have time
And I am 100% sure some others here are as well
There was a Jeopardy?!
yep! we won cuz a kid on our team was there the last round tooâ€¦
ez win
lmao
such a vibe
yes I love cheating jeopardy
Damnn im jelly now
ez i gotchu
i registered yesterday u shld be fine
Our spring break is like super late 😒
Dude i am this 👌much away from doing exactly that
Anyways if any of yall will be/still be there at fall iâ€™d love to meet u guys!
ill b there in the fall! would love to meet up during discovery werk
week
I am obligated to be on campus during discovery week lol
I might be there we shall see
:000 r u guys like orientation leaders?
I will be helping with move-in
Iâ€™ll see you there 🫡
oh question: best freshman year dorm
Taplin
Is that a biased answer or objective
I did not live in Taplin
So probably not biased
whats good abt taplin compared
It has the best amenities and good social cohesion
k cool ty
Taft is also good
When I was a freshman, Cutler was good as well
I am in Cutter and it's pretty good. Juniper dorms are quite good but I don't have as much insight into the others tbh
I am a member of Greek life, and traditionally at Case, Greek life members help freshmen move in
Woo fellow coward!! I am also wayy too awkward to be a potential o leader
Great! Ig ill see you guys then on august or earlier if i ever decide on an admitted students day
im coming to admitted students this wk!
Awesome!
If you want to be shown anything in particular I am more than happy to help and I know others are as well
They have a sample itinerary and I believe that they do
ok!!
Iâ€™ll also be there nxt week 🫣
Welp
Congrats!
Ayy congrats
Shine on 🫡
See you in August!
can't wait to meet you!
I might be a 145 TA for next fall hehe
145 with Wnek was a good time
https://tenor.com/view/smile-wave-emoji-gif-26748925
Hey!
Hi
How busy is the accepted student day
That's because of the eclipse
If you wait two weeks it will be back to normal
It's usually hard to get a hotel near campus just because an extra several hundred people staying in hotels is pretty significant
For admitted students weekends
What is this server?
mostly a server for admitted/prospective students to talk with current students, ask questions, hang out, etc
@toojewforschool favorite ajr song, go
Hbu?
Omfg kaavya. U like ajr too????????
Whatâ€™s your favorite?
Very appropriate for this stage of our lives 😃
I love everything but karma has a special place in my heart
my friend's fav song around this time last year was also Donâ€™t Throw out my Legos XD
Right!
Its SO good like the drum part that sounds like almost thunder???? Amazing
The cool like cowbell part that catches you by surprise is always so cool
Did not know it was cowbells!
Did you watch the one spectacular night concert
Noooâ€¦ i only went to the ok orchestra tour
Iâ€™m seeing the TMM tour!
Oh I meant that virtual concert they had haha
Ahhhhh oops 🫣
im going to tour thursday is there anything I should make sure to attend
If there's an open house for your intended major, try to go
You can get some helpful advice
https://tenor.com/view/griddy-gif-gif-25339935
Ayyy Iâ€™ll see you on the bme tour :)
wsg
NO SHOT
any peach tree rascal listeners?
or grentperez
I'm a Good Kid guy rn
My flight to Cleveland might have gotten canceled
guh
😭
id imagine coming into cleveland is pretty fine rn its relatively nice
Also Omg i love good kidâ€™s version of from the start
ah
good ol' yew nork
its better in the city than the suburbs tho
I went to NYC once it was fun but very busy
ive always lived in cities but i think nyc is too city for me
yea, very chaotic place
and crowded
love it here tho lol
Cleveland is chill
yea im ready to move
except of course when its insane, but its insane in a very unique way and I appreciate that
La Guardia moment
lowkey kinda
I'm going from Boston to Laguardia
Laguardia to cleveland
oof gl w that
Uh huh 😭
yea the weather at lga is quite trash probably
consider going from boston to cleveland (no laguardia) if you can
or better yet
teleport
A little late for that 💀
ah well I'd say if you figure out how to teleport you can probably get free tuition
teleportation is the best skill to learn
good luck and safe travels
delta is surprisingly expensive for direct from lga to cle
compared to like lga to pittsburgh
Lax to Det we delayed by like an hour
this is depressing.
We had to sprint to catch our det to Albany flight
And now this 😭
earlier there was hail coming from all directions
im in columbus rn
we've had a couple of windy/rainy days but its been relatively good atm
the wind has tipped some trees by my house lol
ooh just realised that anyone visiting this week will get to witness HvZ
true!
yeah its like a big game of infection but with nerf blasters and socks and terrifying amounts of strategy for some people
Lowkey i rlly wanna try next yr
Its sounds so fucking awesome
dude it had me jumping at footsteps behind me on the like 30sec walk from my dorm to the dining hall 😭 its definitely a very immersive game
Reminds me of that one community episode
most people just plan routes to classes and stuff
part of the fun is realising what buildings are connected and how and figuring out all the weird ways to get places
if you're clever, insane, and own a lot of socks, you can be pretty safe for a while
I play it every semester and plan it. Super fun game!
Whats up with the socks
you can stun zombies with nerf darts or socks
You can use socks or nerf blasters to defend yourself from zombies
Lol can pretty much anyone join?
yeah. just need to sign up and attend a rules session iirc
Thats HILARIOUS
Ah cool cool cool!
sounds like i need to buy a nerf blaster
We should stock up on socks
there are lists of approved/unapproved blasters this sem, but idk how that will change in future
ok so i may just buy it closer to the start
https://casehvz.com/ has a ton of info on it
ty 🙏
🙏
godspeed o7
to any prospective cs majors, there's a CDS open house tomorrow that i'd highly rec you attend if you're interested in the major 👀 (~~definitely not because i volunteered for the Q&A~~)
thats a surprise
Does anyone know what pass they are referring to
Wait nvm
Wait actually yeaah what pass
The email I got yesterday
My case mail always goes to spam you might have to look around for the email
HvZ is a lot of fun, I recommend all freshmen try it first semester :brainz:
In all seriousness it's a lot of fun, being a zombie is also fun, you get all of the fun missions with none of the anxiety
Do I have to submit the â€œmy scheduleâ€ anywhere or just wait?
I did it last year and it seems theyâ€™ve changed it a bit but yeah iirc the thinkbox tour you had to sign up(?) and maybe some other special stuff but in general it was just be there and do whatever
i j showed up to my second thinkbox tour and it was fine
What time are yâ€™all free thursday/friday if sue and I wanted to be showed around?
Thursday as in tomorrow?
Thursday is busy for me but Friday I can do from 2-4
Yeah tomorrow and the day after
@Show Me Places anyone else free tomorrow?
Friday would probably be better anyway! I think the admitted student events are mostly repeats
HAHA good luck 🫡
Tomorrow I have from like 3:45-6 free and Iâ€™m busy Friday
Nevermind!
:brainz:
The horde claims another
brainz :(
Noo, I was almost in the same spot
Now I'm driving from Columbus and getting to my hotel at 12:30
Oh geez where did u come from??
Wait so howâ€™d you end up getting to columbus..?
HvZ will be going on until next Friday
Plenty of time to witness us in action
Anytime and place specifically? Or just all around
All over campus
We had layover in laguradia but were coming from Boston because I just toured WPI. Somehow we got on a flight that was direct
Nitro user detected
Guilty as charged
I like having larger uploads, gif pfp, and emotes anywhere
It's the 2nd 2hr hour drive we've done this trip
columbus to cleveland is a pretty drive in the fall
im on campus!
:0
would recommend eating somewhere in little italy if you can afford to while you guys are visiting
ayy
little italy?
they cloned italy and dropped it behind campus :D
maybe ill go for dinner!
cute little neighborhood with italian restaurants and gelato. pretty darn good pasta
any recs
specific restaurants?
Michaelangeloâ€™s and Mia Bella
every time my family tries to book at michaelangelo's it's always full 😔 but it's really good
and mitchell's for ice cream
presti's for gelato/desserts
I am a big fan of la dolce vita, mamma santa's, and tavern of little Italy
I'm also on campus!
Exciting!
Mitchellâ€™s was insane
Picking my college based only on ice cream
Congrats youre becoming me
Itâ€™s true, tomorrow I am going on all of the nursing tours
Youâ€™ll be the perfect me that couldâ€™ve been
Iâ€™m glad you understand
I was told Fribley is the good dining hall is that accurate
Yea Fribley is better than leutner imo
Where do you tend to eat then?
During my freshman year I mostly used my portable and cafe swipes to eat around campus
Now I'm in a fraternity so we deal with our food differently
Eg. No swipes
Is joining a frat the way to go for food sensitivities lol
There are a lot of on-campus restaurants that take special meal swipes. There's a taco place which I like a lot, a grilled cheese place, a salad place, and more
Dan is Mr. Food in our frat
First year kitchens are okay and from what I know, most other places have good kitchens
Yeah, first year kitchens are difficult. If you want kitchen access first year AVOID Clarke Tower
I learned from experience
I have issues with oil so it seems like cooking is the best option
Oh no whatâ€™s up with Clarke Tower
Presumably one kitchen 11 floors?
Yeah, one kitchen shared between 300 people and not well-kept
you can request a meal plan accommodation where they can make custom meals for u at dining halls to pick up
I did not join a fraternity just for food lol. Dining halls will try to accommodate food allergies and dietary stuff, but for example, if you're dairy free or vegetarian the offerings can get really repetitive
I got taken off the meal plan for next yr which is nice
so I got a dorm with a kitchen
Oh very nice
I need to cook more
No please explain these epic endeavors
Unlimited meal plan does a lot to dissuade cooking tho Iâ€™ll be honest
The kitchen is not awesome, but I bought some nice pots and pans and I made some soups routinely, sandwiches, once I made steak, pasta dishes, etc. It was pretty fun
imo
Yeah, for first year the kitchens aren't great
Daniel is the person to know, confirmed
A lot of the upperclassmen in the server happen to be in Greek life, but it's definitely not the only option to have a positive college experience! It's good for some people, but not everyone
^^^^^^ do what feels right to you and there are a ton of places where you can fit in on campus. I came in not expecting to join Greek life (and actually being pretty anti-Greek life) and then stuff happened and itâ€™s like oh okay this is a comfortable group of people. Do what works for you
Got it, thank you so much everyone
There are a lot of nice restaurants around the area that you can get pretty solid meal deals at, but when you're forced to have a meal plan you might as well get your money's worth
My favorite meal plan accepting places were 
- brb for regular swipes
- dunkin and elephant step for cafe swipes 
- local taco for portable swipes
They tend to be better during admitted students weekends lol
Breakfast at leut today was okay
Also, is classics a planned minor or a double major? Because the latter may be very challenging
Classics as a secondary major is very doable
Source: @makerofmemes
Not for an engineering degree lol
Oh true
Engineers got it rough sometimes
How did it go
Iirc
Oh itheres like different stations but I only had chicken and rice 7/10
7/10 is pretty good ngl
It's probably possible, but it probably wouldn't be fun. Tbh, if you're interested in meche, I would consider doing it over bme (becomes mechanical engineer)
Business Major Eventually
@bnkoeppen has experience with this
One thing I found challenging as a first year was avoiding pork in the dining halls
Leutner fucking loves serving pork
Not a major, but consider joining the medical technology group club on campus
I try to avoid pork as well and itâ€™s a bit difficult sometimes but very doable
THATS HONESTLY SO REAL
They gonna be at the student org thing?
Prosthetics can definitely fall into bme and meche, the issue with bme that you can run into is just that it tries to do a little bit of everything and can struggle to find a true specialty. At least from my external perspective
I have no idea
But one of my brothers is an EE who really enjoys his time in the med tech group
Not all clubs are represented at that
PLEASE why not??
Do yâ€™all know if nursing majors ever double major/have minors?
it worked out that way for me but you can also consult with nutrition or disability people on campus to get an exemption i've heard
Thisâ€™ll be me Iâ€™m sure
https://case.edu/dining/meal-plans/meal-plan-exemption
this site lies more than the average american politician but it has some good info
Completely unrelated to food or academicsâ€” Ohio has the orange-est squirrels Iâ€™ve ever seen and I have so many unsolicited squirrel pics now
because i can tell you from experience their gluten free stuff is sometimes not gluten free and their vegan/vegetarian stuff is sometimes not vegan/vegetarian
😭😭 cooking it is
i had a rice cooker and air fryer in the dorm kitchen and it worked pretty well for me
Iâ€™ll follow your lead

theres a reason why this place is expensive (😭)
i think you technically can but nursing people can barely handle just nursing a decent amount of the time once you get into later years
You going to the student social at 5?? Letâ€™s meet up
uhh
i could talk to ppl later if they wanted once i get out of my dr appt lol
lemme see
Yeppppp thought soâ€¦.thats so depressing 😩
yes
cwru has mostly fox squirrels!
Same. I have from 3:45-6
columbus is all gray squirrels
i am a cwru squirrel enthusiast lol
Wait how has dorms been for first years
also if anyone wants to see some cool stuff you might be allowed to sit in on early music singers and baroque orchestra rehearsing Handel's Messiah tonight
yes!
or you can just see the concert if you are here on the 8th
Itâ€™s been pretty good. Dorms get hot but itâ€™s super survivable. I donâ€™t spend much time in my dorm and actually this week Iâ€™m not even living there but itâ€™s good
tbh just try not to get an upper floor of clarke
1 shower per floor?
5 for us
depends on layout
sometimes its one shower per quad or a certain amount of showers shared with the entire floor
clarke is one shower per 8 people in each quad
Iâ€™m in Cutter 2. We have 5 showers and 4 stalls in the bathroom. The bathroom is shared with the whole floor ~30-35 people?
im in storrs (quad style) and each quad has one bathroom with 2 sinks, 1 toilet, 1 shower
i would say avoid storrs 4th floor just bc the sinks are low as all hell
taft 3rd floor has 2 bathrooms, 5 showers total, 4 stalls, and 6 sinks
~33 ppl
youre not in taplin?
slay
for max 35 people (9 to a quad)
there has been one time all year that i had to check all 4 bathrooms before i found a free shower; ive never had to wait for a free shower, and have never even had to check all the bathrooms for a free toilet. usually at least 1 sink in the bathroom in my quad is open
Ohhhhh thats a huge relief
^ as much as itâ€™s a lot of people, itâ€™s a lot of people on a lot of different schedules
I wonder how many cwru students are from like
The southeast like I am
Maybe NC?
i was in florida when i applied
And chapel Hill
I know some Florida, South Carolina, and Kentucky
Education is never that great where we are so
I just assumed we would have a lower %
https://case.edu/admission/apply/facts-figures

is there no southeast category
does south include fl etc ig?
south means southeast
on most regional statistics for the US south means former confederacy
oh that makes sense
low from southwest makes sense since presence of colorado and california universities nearby and lower population
0.9% lol
my puffer is making me melt inside the buildings 😭
what site is this
Niche and us news

graduation rate is up a lot from what i remember

east bay area is enough to explain this
nah
bay area
😭  fr
I know a lot of people from NC and Florida, and a few from SC

yeesh
@ the Show Me Places people: I cannot retain information for the life of me so I apologize if you already said, but is someone free tomorrow at 4?
I have a meeting tomorrow at 4 😔
I can do earlier
Honestly I did most of the admitted student day things today so tomorrow is mostly free
My freest time tomorrow is like 2:30-3:30
I am maybe free from 5-5:30depending on how efficiently i do laundry
Did I meet anyone in this server in that popcorn thingy we had?
I was the guy wearing ugly mustard yellow
From what Kaayva says, yes itâ€™s worth it
Itâ€™s super cool, especially if you like making stuff
i love that place
BUT, if thats the only thing left to see, it may not be worth it
if you are planning on doing any kinda robotics/design teams, then probably
bro nursing building is fire

True. It will distract you from the insanity of a nursing major 😅
Im getting concerned for my life next yr
If it's what you want to do it's worth it and rewarding. There is a reason Case is one of the best in the world for it though
From what I've heard
academic pressure is not a problem
high school has been rough enough
how'd yall get that clown thing lol
Falling for the discord April fools joke
ill adapt and become kay chung RAAAAAAH🦅
Ok so I have a situationship between two schools
I also have Case that already offered a lot of money
by just using my CSS
should I submit two deposits, one for Umiami and Case (waived fee) and wait until Umiami gives me my package?
Assuming your finances are such
do you know when UMiami gives the package?
FAFSA should release for UMiami long before May 1
Not to mention most schools are extending it to June 1st in the event that the FAFSA undergoes 27363 more delays
east coast earthquake 💪
yall felt that?
it was wild
im in ny and the building i was in like the piano was moving a bit lmao

45 minute commute 😭😭
oh god
Thatâ€™s fine, what will we be looking at
Was hoping to see a dorm (and dorm bathroom lol) if possible and not sure if thereâ€™s any specific cool spots other than that?
Are any freshmen available?
I am once I get my laundry in
Give me 10
Letâ€™s GO
AYY
Which dorm should I be walking to
:lmao:
Youâ€™re the new one here go wherever on Northside and weâ€™ll come to you
Youâ€™ll be fiiiiine
Aight Iâ€™m at fribley rn but Iâ€™ll go walk towards Tink?
I am in Tink right now so Iâ€™ll see you there
ME
People who do
Dual majors or major and minor and both are engineering
Are terrifying
this kid scares me
i saw that and was like
(My dorm)
In my infinite wisdom I put my jacket in the washer so itâ€™ll be a nice cold walk over
Lord I can come to you if thatâ€™s better
Naw cutter is where my other jackets are
Ok I just got to tink
Presumably Adam is there
Micah where are you

In front of the big stairs

Pretend that was in all caps
LMAO

Lowkey kinda fun i wanna go again

everyone at skl was making a big deal of it
lol
made no sense to me
Ppl r j super jumpy

Minor in AI is it worth it or just a CS major is enough for specialisation in AI
Do it if you think you would enjoy it
guys tell me if u see it
surely it will not be overcast !
Just saw someone talking about how they went 3/1240 on cs internships their first time around
I am so cooked
like they applied to 1240 internships??
Yes

As a sophomore he went 30/350 but he's also known in a2c to be like a really good applicant regardless so probably not indicative of the average person looking for an internship
>known in a2c to be a good applicant
meaningless lol
It's not a reddit community
It has almost 0 connection to the reddit lmao they are very adamant on that part
It's also not meaningless because we've seen things of his resume we know how good of an applicant he is
also, good is pretty sujective. what you might think is good might not be good for a recruiter
i suggest talking to people who have had careers/been in it for a while, the career office, former/current job recruiters, people like that
I think if you're going 30/350 you're a pretty good applicant in this climate
the people who are worth talking to are not on these kinds of websites trust me
Yes
They are?
There r plenty of advisors in that discord 😭
Nobody's going to him for guides on how to build a resume or something that's not what I was talking about
it's just one case
The a2c part was entirely irrelevant to what I was talking about
I just added it so people could know where he was from
why not? it's a stable job
but dont worry about the market man it'll always be up and down
Lie detector tests constant drug tests
is that a thing? yea that might be annoying
Speaking of pay government tends to pay less there than a different industry may
yea thats true but the good thing about it is that it's stable
it does pay less than the industry generally but you get good benefits and you're less likely to get laid off
Pretty sure you're required to work there for 4 years
Through the scholarship anyway

oh itâ€™s like rotc
seems cool
hows everyones eclipse
cleveland folks share pictures 🙏
lmao it was odd
yeaaa
how was it for you?

the best part? the cwru glasses did not make me go blind
Going blind is part of the experience
hahaha
many of my friends dared me to look at the sun
i think i did by mistake a couple of times
i have done this too
yeah
i got dared as well, good thing i had a bunch of polarizing sunglasses
:doubleskull:
💀
yeah :/ but hey, you can get glasses for $10 to look directly at it
a deal is a deal
so real
my school gave them for free 😭
luckyy
had a nice party on the field lol
is anyone coming to the students day on the 11th?
Case did the same
yall got them cwru branded stuff
which cwru sweater/ hoodie do yall reccomend lmao
gotta rep case
I prefer the ones without the logo and that just say CWRU and not the entire absurdly long name
yeah me too
noted
yes!
I considered it but nah
rep the free shirts you get instead
alr
What happens is high schools start massive construction projects 0.00001 microseconds after you graduate
:sadJoegbh:

@reddishlightning roles or I embezzle glub funds
maffew
Once we actually get to cwru
We can request like
How they made the decision to admit us
Wait we can? I actually did not know this
But usually universities you can ask them about your file
That's why I am interested in asking them ab mine
Ferpa 💪

@reddishlightning @cawu thank you for the warnings 🙏
i guarantee u im gna forget next year but
the warning was nicr
*nice
What even is this app

Real
Nah
Classics is where it's at
If only I could be

Throws up
Classics 😭
Just committed!!!
CONGRATS!
Congrats!
Adam is less enthusiastic than me I think we should draw and quarter him
ExCUSE me Jake I reacted with the heart emoji first
Thatâ€™s true
CONGRATS!!
i for one am not going to be drawn and quartered for lack of enthusiasm
no but fr thats so exciting :)

welcome 💪🏾 !
My favorite admitted student activity today has been dodging the abortion protesters lol
So true
I actually havenâ€™t seen them before
I walked through the physics building a bit, Iâ€™ll definitely try to check it out
Nice
Also I had no idea that the CS panel was going to be in the big ballroom
How many students am I going to be sitting in front of??
Probably a lot 😂
Tink is full right now
It is
Oh wow
sadge
Naw itâ€™s great
It makes me happy
i like seeing the groups :D
I mean itâ€™s cool being here while stuff is actually going on to see what itâ€™s like
True
Iâ€™m not used to seeing this many books 😂
Until the CS panel anyway
Canâ€™t wait to be an influencer
Where are you?
By 8-twenty-6
Alright, I have a dark gray CWRU sweatshirt on
Iâ€™ll be there in a second
And the demolition of it â˜🏾
that ruined my lunch
dodge the abortion protesters simulator 😔 advice is to simply not answer them or acknowledge them or else they'll start dialoging with you or hound you
only problem i found is that dunkin is too busy to keep making hot coffees for swipes
not always but sometimes
:0
they're back?
making it my aim to do that with my frien
do y'all have a favorite cwru merch? I would love to check out some cool pics :)
I like my CWRU hoodies
^ second
If you can get your hands on club merch some of their designs go pretty hard
Does anyone know where the SOURCE spreadsheet is for the reswarch thing
@roguish_raven I am in your walls
This guy walked into the room with a STAR WARS PONCHO
Absolutely legend
like a poncho that says star wars on it or a poncho of the variety one might see in star wars
poncho with star wars art on it

dude you know youve been at case for too long when you forget cia can mean things other than cleveland institute of art
Itâ€™s so comfy bro

Hi people :) I redownloaded discord for this lol
Welcomee! (Its totally going to be worth it)
Thatâ€™s good to here, thanks
I do not have anything against discord I have just not had a reason to use it for a long time itâ€™s all good
HEHE
Also I LOVE ur pfp
Actually everyone has amazing pfp wow
Us but in scrubs or something else nursing student relatable

Haha yeaa
@quinsential is the other one of us in here
Anyway yeah if you have any questions lmk and I know the curricula very well for course planning purposes
Welcome!
incredibly based
Ty, good to have someone if i have questions about that
Do any current case students have anyone in marching band they could put me in contact with
Lovely
That's false, most student will get a pookie during first year
Why is this a list 🤨
85% of it is just "x... Institute of technology"
RIT was also up here which was conveniently my first choice before cwru
4 out of the top 15 are colleges i was accepted to 😭
oh brother
well looks are subjective im sure you all look great
@tazmania40
How so?
hah i sent this exact thing to my friend who is going to wpi
Youâ€™ll see lots of new couples after the 1st week
And after marriage pact

Cwru's 2028 class page is 95% "I'm not 100% committed to case but..."
Seeing that 16% yield rate in real time
Hi!
I do Marching Band, what would you like to know!
so real
Officially committed!
congrats!!
Congrats :D
okay
Is this a guy one of those fake accounts?
They sent the same message in the server for class of â€˜27
So itâ€™s probably just a troll
💀 i just saw both
Congratsss!!! 🎉
Thank you!
Good for you!
hopefully you like the school you transfer to better
Man
They just sent me my fin aid estimate
Id be getting a 2k refund to go 😭😭
But ofc they had to reject me from my major and put me on a 2nd choice
Is it easy to transfer into your first choice?
No
The path they put me on literally locks me into IT basically
😭
The difference between RIT's cost and cwru's is 5 grand a year
Why would it be beneficial to go to RIT and transfer vs going to case
It's having to uproot my entire life goals
To go there
With the weird program RIT did I'd have to get an associates in "applied computing technology" and then transfer to 'human centered computing" and IT
But agh
fr
^
imean i do but i also wanna do neuro sci
ah okk
Then why did you commit lmao
I just think it's goofy to go into the new students server to talk about how much you regret deciding to commit when you can just like. Not go
i mean i think itâ€™s reasonable to also hear from students who dislike the school when youâ€™re an incoming student bc you can assess whether the things that bothered them would also bother you
ya also so they can be prepared and not come in thinkingâ€™s itâ€™s so rainbows and sunshine here
I personally think there's a difference between providing a mixed or negative perspective (which is totally valid) and just dropping random and vague complaints in gen chat
I agree with both Charlie and Sophie here
Getting feedback from all sorts of students is good
this is definitely true
However, what Charlie said
To be honest, I personally disagree with all of these points
...
me when

Is this loss
Took this at the lakefront nature preserve I biked to yesterday. Beautiful 70+ degree sunny spring day
but healthline is good
Im fine with the delays sometimes the idea that i can travel to most places for free is pretty cool
Most of the issues you mentioned r non issues for me
Thank god
true to your major
:TrollGe:
Unless I drove from south Carolina to ohio in one
In my experience this is not true tbh, I have had no issues getting places when I've needed to
Yikes
Bought one up here
Actually no
It actually is less expensive to get ur car shipped than I thought
You can also TA
you can?
how
Asking professors
a bike can go a long way
Learn how to ride a bike
like any class
or are they just gonna go LOL
I have 2 TAing engagements for Spring '25 literally by going:
"Hey, I'm in this class right now. I'm doing well. Can I TA?"
"Sure."
Well I mean generally you'd have a higher win% asking profs who know who you are
I know the professors as well
oh thatâ€™s great
Does being a ta pay well
probably not
Well is yk
Relative
Obviously not as much but you're not working as much
Cause my mom is planning to take up the 3k they're asking for
People were telling me I should try and get one during summer of freshman year but that seems very improbable unless you're like a project demon
@kkkkkk4nj1 I read your username and immediately thought organic chemistry
🤨 why is a fox pfp equivalent to being an incel
Hey knock it off
Incel is a rly random insult to throw out anyway to someone that just talked about not liking case
Lmao
No did you see the message that got deleted
Exactly bro
The 2 meme images
The reason for the "incel" comment was as far as I understand it, not because of the not liking Case
It was the message the person sent and then deleted within seconds
Lol
how does that make him an incel
What in particular
no that's what i'm asking
again like i said bro is projecting
You wouldn't know that because you weren't even in the server when the message in question was sent
the most that would've been considered "incel" was mog
and everyone says that nowadays
Like I said, what provoked the comment was a message that has since been deleted
Yes which is what the message I am referring to said
Lmao
https://tenor.com/view/stare-cat-cat-stare-cat-meme-cat-mog-gif-13316903691512249943
Which message are you referring to
The one studyacc sent
... which one
He sent a few
"What does mog mean"
The last message I saw from him was the 2 meme images
...
The message which provoked the "incel" comment was deleted within seconds of being sent
Regardless of whether it deserved the label of incel it was definitely not appropriate for this server
why is mog inappropriate 😭
CS classes, not so much
Also yeah 0cem is definitely an alt of studyacc which is why I kicked lol
I got a tablet going into the ib program and itâ€™s been a lifesaver
yeah i know notebooks can be fun and useful! it's just whenever i write in them i end up copying everything to google docs / obsidian anyway, so that's the part i'm trying to avoid
some people also will use tablet to copy and annotate a slideshow or the professor's notes or the homework or whatnot. Double-edged sword in that yes its easy but you're also not writing down as much content which could stop it from sticking in your brain
can i ask why you end up copying it over?
YES whiteboards are good and chalkboards are also amazing
No
The sound
Ooo I love whiteboards for review sessions
i agree w u here i cannot do digital note taking
Whiteboard over chalk any day idc if itâ€™s not a classic academic aesthetic
RRIGHT
There are so many at case
speaking from experience it is notâ€¦
They make edible chalk
I have come very close a few times
Also I totally read that wrong I thought you were talking about writing w it mb
why would u eat the good chalk
what if it tastes better
What if not
i dont think thats how that works
Good chalk=better texture
point being
do what works for you
At least good hospitals are nearbyâ€¦
try new things!
eat chalk!
(not chalk)
Case ems will have an interesting call
yall calcium powder does not taste good
Wait what does being a math major have to do with wanting to eat chalk exactly

we like chalk
is it worth it?
Yes.
If ur body can absorb ur bones will be stronk
do any professors actually care about me not having non-digital notes tho? if it's dumb then disregard the question i just have a cultural background when all my notes for all of my classes had to be handled to a teacher to check them out
trust its not
(i'm an english major and I'm yet to meet one prof who cares how i take notes)
Why not case:
Are you speaking from experience?
And ur not hurting ur back
YES I AM
yes it sounds like my reasons to do it!!
i used to take calcium powder every morning in a class of water
do what helps you learn and study best
frickin disgusting
i'm reading everything (chalk too) so its alright
it was not by choice.
i see
is there another admitted students thing this thursday?
Maybe
Yep

Sounds like i should try eating chalk
Let me know how it is if you do
sounds like the rite of passage
yeah a roommate obv, thanks!
i saw that one as well
me walkin in at 9:35pm (after@indiance 's bedtime)
my roomie sleeps deep enough that me coming back at like 4am is no problem kek 😂
I am that deep sleeping roomie
The fire alarm cannot even wake me up
He did infact walk in at 9:35 PM
but after my bedtime
LFG
We stay on time in this household
Me and my roommate both slept through a fire drill once in freshman year
Nice
Cutter
So real
we've had what 5 fire alarms over the past 2 sems
yeah its someone not using a microwave properly
- if people could read the world would be a much better place @cawu

Letâ€™s goo
chalk tastes good 
expo markers smell good
i see no losers here
Can you draw fun dotted lines with whiteboard markers?
No?
Thatâ€™s what I thought.

I think so, I remember I registered for courses my first semester all the way in July I think
GOOD LUCK
I hope you somehow get the course you need with decent rate my prof scores
Iâ€™m manifesting it for yâ€™all
preciate it
I think that is right the â€˜college road mapâ€™ said something like that
I would have no incentive to lie to future freshmen anyways
Good
I appreciate that
But if you were Iâ€™d probably not be able to tell lol
Splendid

People in Latin America often forget about the linguistic minorities in Spain as well
True
Euskara
My mother was NOT expecting to be spoken to in Catalan 💀
Of course
Yeah Catalan is funky
I have never learned it but Iâ€™d love to
Maybe?
Maybe I should look that up
I believe Catalan and Occitan are closely related, but one has more French influence and the other more Spanish influence
True, modern standardized French or Italian really emerged in 19th century based on particular dialects
Funny how the dialect continuum within Spanish sort of crosses the ocean and continues through to the Caribbean, southern Spanish has many similar traits to Caribbean Spanish
I'd believe that, but both are more distant to Castilian
Many settlers of Latin America came from there, hence why no c/s distinction in almost all of LatAm
True and especially in the Caribbean, many from the Canaries as well in Puerto Rico in particular
I love linguistics
So true
What Iâ€™ve thought but also I am not a linguist
Pretty *nice* results so far
Very good
POLL?

GOTTA CHOOSE THE MONEYYYY
Okay, alexis (business '28)
WOOOOOO
Getting the bag
thats the basque language right
class reg went better than expected :PES_SadGePray:
They'd probably laugh in my face
Yuh
Lmao
I don't plan on negotiating anyway
😔
Yes they will

they will tell u maybe go there then!
Ngl even if I could negotiate it
I wouldn't

hi ~
Hello
how are u ? ><
I'm good. Been busy, spent a lot of time today trying to chase down some PCBs that were supposedly delivered for CWRUbotix. 

And then I was hanging out at thinkbox. 

How are you doing?
guys guys
i make kdrama edits
do u wanna see them
Yeah
itâ€™ll be in #media
@rach6363 completely random question but what the biggest number u got on 2048
8192
a few times
@rach6363 generally how long out of the day do u play 2048
IVE COMMITTEEEEED
Congrats!!!
welcome welcome
welcome to Case!!!!
I wonder when they'll release admissions data
I wanna see what the stats were for this year
Prolly after may 1st when they get all their commitments
They like to release admitted students + matriculating students data at the same time
Congrats!!!
I'm so stressed.... I have no idea where to chose
It's between wpi and here. Has anyone else made a similar decision?
@dborhegyi
I believe he made this exact decision actually
I literally chose between WPI and Case! In just a minute I'll send some thoughts
Alright thank you so much
^
Tsym, do you mind if I friend request u so I can ask more questions in a few
yea, no problem!
hey guys quick question not really too related to cwru but figured some of u might know anyway
what is the difference between biotech and bioinformatics
in the courses you take during college and career wise?
i'm pretty sure biotech is more related to lab-based experiments and such while bioinformatics is collecting and analyzing these large amounts of data
bit of a shameless plug, but if anyone's on campus tomorrow, 11:30 to 2 is the undergraduate research poster session in veale
it's a good opportunity to get a glimpse of the type of research people are doing here, and might inspire you to similarly get involved 🙃
To emphasize Lindsey's point bioinformatics is a combination of stats and bio whereas biotechnology will be more towards cs/engineering and bio
So I called and they said in order to get summer courses pre approved, I had to use â€œMyJourneyâ€ to submit a form
Does anyone know where I can find that
journey.case.edu
But you need a case ID to get in
Thx

Can you get a minor through intellectual breadth credits?
Yes
Aight thx
Iâ€™m going into debt
Itâ€™s joever
Did any of you perchance attend the CS panel today
Does cwru have the little food delivery robots
And if so how do you order with them/does it cost extra
Food delivery robots?
You could start up a business by building them in the thinkbox maybe
Right!
I mean food delivery bots r already a thing but making one for cwru would be cool
We need to recruit an engineer lol
No maybe one day!
alright road trip to ohio state they have a bunch of the little doordash robots
True
ez
Imagine being the person who came up with the concept of a door
we have enough BMEs
guys guys choose
Right

i just pierced my ear
by myself
Bro is preparing for the hands on learning that theyâ€™ll get at Case
😭
WHAT
it bled a lil

😃
😖
This is the most wild post LMAO
it looks good! you can do me at case lol
Lol, there's a grain of truth maybe but I don't think it's super true
The grain of truth is that case is very skewed towards the nerdier people you might find in a high school. So the definition of "cool" is very different. Like, only at case can I say "yeah I'm trying to make a pokemon romhack" or "I'm working on some DnD homebrew" and people will be like "woah cool"
I committed today (:

CONGRATS
yayyy
Congrats!!!
Ty ty
welcome welcome, happy to have you here
welcome!!
Yeah I saw that
Lmao
If being average is good enough to be popular at case I'm about to be a frat president
Average is far from the word Iâ€™d use for most case students
I mean in terms of
How frats r usually seen as these super social ppl
So If being "normal" in a regular highschool made you "cool" at case I'd be the case equivalent of that
Quantifiable benefit of that is
I mean whatâ€™s the quantifiable benefit of having friends
They are not equivalent but itâ€™s a similar idea
In addition to the social and communal nature of frats, there is plenty of networking, commitment, leadership positions, philanthropy etc.. Case has some pretty unique greek life that doesn't conform with "frat guy" norms whatsoever, although if you're looking for more traditional greek life, that exists too
Ah I understand your analogy, but that reddit post is still not super accurate
Normal is very relative, and people who are less nerdy are not really idolized or anything lol
Is anyone here a mega CS nerd because I've been thinking of a problem recently
🫵
Given a set S, what is the time complexity of finding the longest arithmetic sequence
The naive algorithm is O(N^3)
Can we do better?
why are yall so intelligent
oh ya now that i am more awake i fully remember how the O system works
it would end up being O(N^2 +logN) witch simplifies to O(N^2)
this is the limit because you are required to compare every index to every other index needing an O(N^2) algorithm
ur so nerdy 😭
its to the point where its admirable
Did anyone here who posted on the case insta get a insta dm request from gabriella_painting
I think I did a while ago but I declined
Itâ€™s a scam but I wanna see how for I can lead it on
Being nerdy is always admirable (future case student 🤓)
FRATERNITY
okay guys I committed
Welcome!!!
CONGRATS
Am I enthusiastic enough Jake?!
AM I?!
you will in a bit i think
Yeah
good work adam
but everything is reflected on the portal so I think I'm okay
neat. it might've been a couple days? i don't fully remember tbh
i am currently in @cawu 's walls
TRUE
im not doing my writing :(
not sure i got an email at all when i committed tbh
they send a messenger pigeon actually
To you, maybe
I got 5 oxen
well ive got a hog. and a pig in a pen
so take that
🌽
why do you have corn adam
to feed the hog and pig, of course
Join Concert Choir then you'll find out
if only i had a pretty little gal :(
i spend my time around sophie i am familiar with the hot and a pig in a pen
Are you telling me Spartie is not the prettiest little gal you ever did see 😔
its ok
they do send some goodies iirc
got a stapler and some stuff and then got a pack of cards(?)
ur good (i have a fixed stapler :trollface:)
and more
Eric Kaler eated all of it
this is true
every day its a new item
Was it like the cards all about case?
those were cool, saw my dad admiring them xd
yea that thing
good luck
Yeah I just blocked them
Lowkey it was actually good info
I appreciated learning about west side market

There is a vex robotics signature event at CWRU next year
oh wait what? which event?
Is this the Vex tournament they will host in the winter?

 CWRUbotix is involved a bit in that as far as organizing for that and I think some of our members are also going to volunteer at the event
It's the launch signature
Do you know where it's gonna be located on campus?
I think they were talking about booking the Tink ballroom

This is the video i found
food service job rly making me question my sanityyy
just retained my C in english 102
man
yeah ive just heard a lot about how schools be sending mail asking to explain and stuff when any grade is lower than a b
this would be my first c since freshman year 😭
😭
I remember this one girl was going to
Wellesley I think the all girls one
And they deadass sent her a letter asking to explain a B
😭
I finally committed
Nice!
congrats!!
Congrats!
welcome!
Still earlier than me lol. Congrats!
I think I committed after getting back from admitted students weekend
welcome welcome
i think i committed around this time as well
me too!!
congrats!!
stop did i just followo you on instagram
whats ur insta?
nvm nvm ur name is spelled differently
LOL
LMAO
send it over anyway ill follow u!
selenecylee :))
Ayy congrats!!!
I waited like a week after I got the letter I think
Decision was March 16th I committed march 30th
i dont know when i formally committed but i decided about halfway through my visit
he found a video on how to replace his door on youtube 💀
Is there a general CWRU discord server
like not just 2028
There are other servers for the different classes like 2027, 2026, etc.
Gotcha
It would be pretty nice though
Neat way to connect with ppl of different majors
nah the general ones are usually just the year ones
These servers are usually most active in the summer before the first semester starts, then they fall off pretty hard and spike around things like course registration
Hope im one of the 11%
you know how few people actually respond to these things, if you have more than 3 brackets with the same respondance percentage.
about 1.95% per person
so like just over 50 people
82 people responded
what year is this from
hear me out i major in neuro instead of chem
👍
2023
Around half of them responded

1,360
More attention or something
what
That's total
We talking about in cs
😭
that makes sense
So like 1/10 of the '23 class was cs
It's really hitting me how small cwru is holy how did i Get in
😭
no i did too it feels like a small number
never mind
:waaah:
its still like 10% of people yea lmao
Yeah the number is small because of the 6000 undergrad population in total but
Relative to population it's a lot
yeah its crazy tho how small this place is sometimes
(i got recommended a reel on how CE is irrelevant)
thats bc the physical area is large i think

not sure how accurate this is its a calculator
i had a 3.6 in hs and my college gpa is also a 3.6
am i doomed to a 3.6 😭
ey i mean
youre a prospective CS major
it could just be lower
I plan to do the BA in cs which like 60% of your courses anyway are electives so maybe that would get me out of some of them but idk
idk about cs stuff but for physics ive been told its way more important to do research and have good experience than it is to have a good grade
3.5+ is very good for CS
3.0+ is also solid tbh
Hello there
Howdy
Yeah but it's like
😭
I just have to figure out if transferring them gives me any notable benefits
Also they updated my application again to send me my same financial aid notification for the third time
Before they even sent me my decision
What do you have?
In costs?
Yeah
Nice
That's awesome actually
Sent me the same document 3 times
😭
They love their emails...

Good old Bob
Like the 26th one I get that's their FAFSA release
But why yesterday
😭
Jake what is your pfp
Lol
CaWU
Not heard that one before
Itâ€™s my username in general
Creative and Witty Username
Lol
It can also be CAse Western reserve University
Yeah. Iâ€™ve had this username for like 5-6 years but joining CWRU it definitely got a little confusing
Jake loves Case western
yall send videos of the scream tonight
bro case locked me outta my account
does anybody know where I can find other spring admits?
Yeah
the only mentions of spring admits were about sororities ://
What major
is there like a gc
@chaotic_sky3 any comment?
wow they seem cool
It probably depends on if you have a lot of ap credits
What?? You good?
No idea
i am one lol
thats how i found my roommate
make one
thank you so much that does help
I did not hear a scream \:-/
Is it finals for u guys rn?
It is!
Ey, same, AP finals kicking my ass 😭
This week and next
What APs
Advanced placement classes
oh guh do you follow the athenian on insta? they posted iirc
yeah he means which AP classes
No I know, I mean which APs are you taking
The olden days
Ooooohh, stats, gov, phys 1&2
Very nice
Not very nice, 😭 I had phys on Monday, and was already running on fumes
You can credit for poli sci 109 at case if you take ap gov + an upper level poli sci course at case
I took AP Chinese, so all my breadth AP creds r covered  anyway 😭
My friends and I were so cooked biking home after that we all went at a red light and no one even noticed
Phys classes
And calc classes?
Oh damn, thank god
Kinematics is like the 1 thing I'm ok at
😭
PHYS 124 (the "hard" E&M) was really really fun
Also not my entire class having a 66% average pre curve for AP phys 🤣
But it was not easy
That sounds about how PHYS 124 was
Yes, because ap exams are praying on your downfall
I got a 50/60 on a midterm and thought "is it over chat" when the class average was a 40/60 lol
You can of course take the normal E&M (122)
🤣 nice
Ok but where's the fun in that
Suffering is pleasure
Easier is very relative lol
Explain
Like do u mean it varies class by class
Or is hw harder and tests easier etc
Well 1. It depends on the class 2. It depends on the professor and 3. It depends on your personal strengths
Ap classes are taught like high school classes
Ah ic
Some professors are trying flipped classrooms, others do trad lectures. Some have optional homework, others use tools like aleks. Some like quizzes, some don't. Some will round grades or drop assignments, others say that what you get is what you get. Professors have a lot more freedom to design their courses, and it's not as standardized as what you're used to in high school
Like I have a class this semester that's 50% one final video project. And I also have a class that's like 80% exams and quizzes
More generally, there's less hand-holding
Which class is 50% a video 😭
Earth history
There's also classes I know people taking that are 25% each quiz with 4 quizzes and no final
Some classes have very difficult exams, but most are pretty reasonable for what you're expected to take away from a course
Figuring out what works for you to learn is one of the big things that should happen in your first year
I've only seen multiple choice in my intro astronomy classes
had mcqs for meyer's chem 111
thats about it
yes indeed i do
i saw it lol
they sent out the official roadmap
move in day is set to the 18th 🥳
Neither are any of us
im definitely ready, just terrified lol
august 18??
Yup
For domestic students
yikes
are those mutually exclusive choices for you? it's not entirely impossible to do both~
I feel like it would just be harder, and it would just be better to fully commit my energies pursuing one
ah that makes sense
im not an engineer but i could speak towards pre-med
dang you are cooking smthn
One of my roommates is BME pre-med It's definitely a thing that people do. But I do get the sense that it's difficult and if you want to choose one that makes sense.
it also does depend on what type of "engineering"
I will also say you don't have to declare immediately at Case so you have some time to decide... But knowing will be helpful for class registration I suppose
im a bit of a bot ig
i got posted on the 2028 cwru instagram
💀
Lmao yeah it happens
Clout
Hopefully it will net you a roommate
Party at Mount Granita

Crazy how you're also named adam
ok real talk engineering is your best bet if you like the subject, otherwise doing an accounting degree would be your best option because the market is in high demand for accountants rn and there's a very short supply
Hi cuties lol I switched my intended major to nursing
WOOOOO
crossing over to the best side
The nursing side
ONE OF US ONE OF US!!!
https://tenor.com/view/join-us-dark-side-cookies-bane-gif-19543446
Shhhhh one of us
Willa out of curiosity how long were you at CIA
NURSING MAJORS R THE BEST 🎉🎉🎉
||Actually nursing is so underrated||
2 years 🥲
Itâ€™s alright!!
Youâ€™ll be way ahead of the rest of us
If youâ€™ve watched Greyâ€™s Anatomy
|| itâ€™s kinda like when George is the intern again ||
I just will have a bunch of elective credits
Nice!
The cult of nursing majors grows larger
r we all planning on becoming an np?
Im looking at being a crna
I'm probably not tbh
not u 😭
nursing ppl
is case western nknown to revoke acceptances?
Not usually
may i dm you?
And keep in mind: if you ask an AO, you can call without revealing who you are so you don't have to worry about disclosing anything about yourself they could connect to you
is it unheard of for it to get rescinded
its not about me ngl
its ab somjeone else
Iâ€™m getting my bsn but I might go further
I may go for an np but I wanna be a SANE nurse
real that is lowkey what ive been thinking like will falling to a b student make them reconsider all of tyhe resources time n money theyve alr invested in me 😭
its up to you on whether you come here or not
going from A to be B is not the end of the world at all
nah they flew me out to visit the school n waived my deposit
frfr
I understand that they did the same here, but thats just miniscule compared to the amount of money they get from every student
not to sound too cheesy or anything but as long as you try your best, you'll be ok
true true i am only paying 3k a year so im like 💀 what if they take away some of my scholarship
realest advice ever
:)
which you seem cognizant about, so again, you'll be ok
SENSATIONALLY LOL i love ur vocab but tyty i appreciate the advice
haha no problem! best of luck for everything
good plan
stats is in two days im cooked 😭
Same dude
im def gonna get a 2 on lit😭
so ass
great gatsby is goated 😮â€💨
frr, its so dumb
hopefully next year lmao, when i take calc 1
common freshman L
(i disliked gatsby)
gl on all your aps though team you got this!!
yall got this stuff
I took lang and liked it, but lit has been painful
eh
depends if you know the 1 formula
I think itâ€™s mainly d for me
for convergent alternating series, the error will always be less than or equal to the next term
the logic goes something like: if you're convergent, you're always getting smaller. Say you've estimated your position to be at x>y, and the true position is at y. Then, the next step will drag you some distance E_0 down towards y. Then the next step will drag you back up, but because each subsequent term is smaller, you know you won't get all the way back to x. So the next step that drags you back down will also drag you down less, and because you're converging to y, you know that that first additional term, E_0 is the furthest you could be from y, because in the extreme case, it drops you to precisely y and then all the other terms are 0
That makes some sense now thank you
I think the wordiness was getting to me
Aight
Part (C) -- what have you been thinking so far
I got it via answer key but especially the bounds for C
part d is very funny
I found I needed tan and arctan to get 2/3 of the points
yeah-- consider how the line y=mx looks in polar
yep
So arctanm is the upper bound
How so?
is the answer the same as (a)?

Yeah
That how they get ya
i was thinking sin(theta) 💀
The curve is also insane
no way i was doing all that a year ago
Si senor
Literally me rn 😣
I just finished the mcq portion of a practice test and I am not getting that 5
We are staying strong 💪💪💪 we WILL get out of STAT201
Not with the 40% I scored on mcq
Thatâ€™s from 2019 Iâ€™ve done like 4 years of frq review and that was by far the hardest
Everything else though was pretty normal besides those like 3 parts
my math teacher had us doing like 1992 review lol
crazy fella

barbeque at 2240 murray hill rd in august??? Drop your fav foods

Same both of my aps are on Tuesday 😦
Econ and stats
yippie /s
Econ and stats 😢
how did those end up transferring? i looked online and it looks like you can get credit but not out of course requirements so im kina confused
SAME
frqs im okay but mc
is nottt pretty
I can bs my way through frqs but mcq...
:0
yeahhh
The stats mcq are worded so weirdly
yeah
Lol we should just have a mass group call tomorrow for stats
do practice stats mcqs and frqs if u can btw
For the ap stats test r the mcq questions ordered randomly or by the order of the units?
do u not have any practice tests?
theyre random
i can give u like
6 sets
How did you get a 6?
I thought youâ€™d appreciate this
Heck yeah
i brokethe scoring system
:0 yea sure i dont have any


Thank u!
the strugglebuddies website also has pdfs of practice ap exams
the first zip has explanations for 12
Iâ€™m literally the opposite I loved stats and got a 5 but Iâ€™m struggling so much with bc rn 😭
Lol imagine taking calc
im taking both...
boutta kms-
Sameeee
thats so valid
I'm on my second one now
discode this
Maybe one day
CSP not counting annoys me
i'd be surprised if any school took csp credit ngl xd
Bro Purdue has AP CSA and AP CSP taking the same credit
astrior
correct!
Like they were going to for admitted students day but
like to just visit? prob not but worth an email
No to like
Actually go there
Move in and stuff
Probably not, but you could try and see what happens
(the flight was hellish btw would not rec)
like we flew in a triangle with some dumb layover
Busy on the daye
they flew us from ohio to missouri to philadelphia...
South Carolina to ohio
But it would've been nice to shorten it lmao
Especially if they're willing to pay for a 2 day program but not to help us actually get to campus
frfr
😭
does frontier not do nonstop to south carolina
thats crazy
Imo do the drive there and back and fly otherwise. You can bring more stuff and move in is a lot more targeted to folks driving than flying
This is when Iâ€™m glad that I only live fifteen minutes away
To graduate, in general, you need the following:
All required courses in your major
18 credits total in 2 categories that your major does not fall into (the three total categories are STEM/Nursing, Business/Social Science, and Arts/Humanities) 
First year seminar
PE
A random assorted list of other requirements/perspectives that some classes happen to have
And in addition to all of that, you need to complete a certain number of credits to graduate (but just making sure you get the other reqs done will match that)

Multiple majors or minors can offset the breadth requirements
What majors/minors are you considering
If you enjoy traveling with family, my dad and I did a 3 day/22 hour road trip from Colorado to Cleveland to move in and it was fun
Do we need a capstone project?
up to 9 credits of the breadth can be covered by ap credits, but you have to take at least 1 course (3 credits) in each breadth area at case
Any examples of what people do for that?
I assume itâ€™s like related to your major, right?
uh my friend made a water bottle that filters water automatically for either her compe or ee senior project? iirc
God
I have the creativity of a snail
I do not wanna do a senior project
i wore it for the 1st half of the semester
Duly noted
Thanks guys
i keep my card in my lanyard sleeve in my pocket
I keep my id in my wallet lol
Whats like the best food on campus?
besides Mitchell's
Depends what you like
It's hotly debated
With portable swipes and special swipes, melt, local taco, subway, and jolly all have their defenders
the stuff at tomlinson is usually pretty good
Stuff on case cash is even more debatable
local taco if you like chipotle, fujisan has rice bowls and sushi
the bagels at the pbl cafe are very good
I also find myself using lots of case cash at falafel cafe
fribley rarely disappoints
put in ur phone case
at least at my hs we need student ids and the conclusion is that phone case is best
is it true that there is a student who roller blades around campus or did the tour guides just make that up?
maybe it is best as a seasonal thing
Recommended Mitchell's Monday Combo:
Theme: Post-Modern take on a Southern Breakfast
Flavors: Toasted Pistachio + Key Lime Pie 
Toppings: Lightly dusted with crushed salted pecans
Yeah, I just carry my wallet everywhere
Most people just use their wallet or phone case
that makes sense
if you use a popsocket with your phone i highly recommend the wallet its so convenient to have my id on me 24/7

Hey
So cooked for ap lit tomorrow
Do you think I could get away with using a book thatâ€™s in German for Q3
I'm pretty sure it's ap English lit lol
Yeah but itâ€™s a work of fiction or whatever
Iâ€™ll just paraphrase
We read Kafka in my AP lit class
I think you could use a foreign/translated novel
business, asian studies, music
There no translation
I mean
Itâ€™s a book
All that matters
True
How do you get yourself in a position where you only know a book thatâ€™s in German anyway
I mean I know other books too
But thereâ€™s this book we read in my ap German class
So I spent a long time reading it and thinking about it so I know it well
what book
Understandable
For my Lit class in one exercise my teacher told us to write about â€œany bookâ€, so I took it literally and wrote about Charles Darwin â€œOn the Origin of Speciesâ€
did you like it? always looking for german books to read
Epic
Yeah it was pretty enjoyable
cool
gl on your aps i believe in you
In general, any novel or narrative that has an English version is probably usable on AP lit, but American novels tend to be the most applicable thematically
Oh no, a cruise, whatever will you do
Finally finished ap stat 😒
WOOOOOO
Iykyk
Right?? The mcqs were strangely harder than usual ):<
does anyone have psych cram tips 💀
i gave up on calc bc case only takes 5s for credit and that is not happening!!!!!!!!
its mostly just remembering terms so I would highly reccomend using flashcards
Im planning to cram all of that info in one night as well lmfao
I did not think I was going to get a 5 and I did
You can do it
its fine
Fr
oh i meant ab!!
Ah
Quizlet the life out of psych. It's all vocab I recommend using the write mode
as long as it has "literary merit"
as they say in the ap guidlines
my plans for the evening= watching summary videos of every book ive read in the past 4 years
also how did stats/econ go for you all?
me too lol
with lit tomorrow
fun times
I think I failed micro but if I get that 5 on stats then it's all worth it
haha
which going in i thought stats was not gonna go well
yall got this!!
Bee confident yall that's half the battle
do some ppl in cwru know how to ride motorcycles
cuz i wanna learn how to
My friend Tyler Griffith runs a motorcycle club that focuses on riding and maintaining motorcycles
https://community.case.edu/cmc/home/
I did this
I was on so many email lists my first year
same
ur an angel
did anyone take cogo that was so weird
wait are you serious that is so cool wtf do you needd a motorcycle to ojin
He said you should join the discord if you were interested. https://discord.gg/7aYTRf8a
Hi Iâ€™m Tobyâ€™s friend Tyler â•
Weâ€™re very low key so if you want to check out the garage or hang out feel free to tag along during the semester to one of our garage sessions
I have a Kawasaki and I have some friends who recently got bikes
The discord is a good place to go for advice on learning to ride / getting a license / buying your first bike / gear / maintenance

:0 that's so cool
How are the protests at case rn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hygwau-rKNo
this just popped up on my feed

Itâ€™s a pretty interesting dynamic
they arrested kids here too?
They released them pretty quickly but teah

THEY RECORD THEIR NAMES?
oh thats fucked
:(
Like when the guy was painting over that mural, did they legally paint that mural in the first place
yes
Thatâ€™s fucked
its spirit wall so anyone can paint there
fly out and help I mean
Why did they paint over it
Genuinely curious
smth about it being offensive
most of the people here have been quite chill in comparison to other universities from what i have heard from others
ziptied :(
arrested but no handcuffs
Do yaâ€™ll think the protesting really is helping?
were riot police there?
just campus police
i think so
at case not really lmaoo
ok cuz in ucla and ucb they called riot police
and thats why it became violent
so trespassing
It was at the beginning and at that point all they had done was set up tents and signs. The charges were dropped so quickly because they werent legally sound and it was also a pretty bad look
Protesting is silly
do yall know how social movements work lmao
Not completely effective
here its more about how university investments and research support certain companies/parties involved in the conflict from what i saw on posters
Itâ€™s raising attention but there are definitely better alternatives for action
For example Vietnam protests worked because it was college aged kids being sent to fight and it was college kids that were protesting
^
issue 31-15 or whatever it was
I remember seeing some protest about like child labor in some forgein county in Europe I think, thatâ€™s not gonna be as effective for various reasons
the main purpose of social movements is basically to raise awareness first
if its effective in doing that then theres gonna be more pressure on the government
since its built to act for the people
All these kids go back home?
a lot of non college students are paying more attention and thats what matters
actually tbh
A good number of people stay over the summer for research or local internships.
I will also say that the proportion of protestors to amount of students is blown out of proportion by the media at certain schools
the action really comes down to re-electing new leaders that support the cause not the ones currently in power tbf
its just 2020 all over again
its ridiculous the only choices we have are two shriveled white men
that prob know dipshit about military tactics and when to use them first of all
trump has done more on paper than biden 💀
age max on the entire government
lower and upper house both full of boomers rn
if you dig deep
the rest of republican party is tho
and if trump gets elected theyre gonna enact a plan that will de-democratize this country entirely
no better if biden gets elected either
cuz hes a lil wuss
okay thats true
you know what this calls for
a new governmental system entirely
see what one can do for the people of america
i genuinely just thought about it
cuz all the candidates we've had are all wusses or the way that the president is elected has prevented women presidents (like hillary)
hillary actually had more votes than trumps back then
but more states had majority vote for trump
the systems screwed
Trump is a criminal on so many counts including but not limited to multiple actions directly intended to interfere with our democracy. Regardless of politics, that much is indisputable. And to say regardless of politics is a monumental favor to Trump
ap gov does smth to ppl i swear 💀
Absolutely
so is biden if we're gonna go into criminal records
but
historically
every president is a criminal in some form
all of them can be damned
There are some things that are normally criminal and also immoral that the president is afforded the right to legally do as president
And there are some things that are actually criminal for a president or presidential candidate to do
oh thats true
will i see a regime change in my lifetime? very likely
Lifetimes are incredibly long. You might see one before you finish your degree
Especially if trump gets elected
🤷â€â™‚ï¸
The observer (cwru student run newspaper) posted some pictures of the stuff that was painted. What was painted by a small group on the advocacy wall could definitely be seen as inflammatory, but the (large group painted) spirit wall where the students were spray painted was not super extreme or anything imo. It was like, anti-war, Palestinian flag, death toll, general artwork and activist stuff
https://www.instagram.com/p/C6ty9BDOmpr/?igsh=cXNvYjNsZWdhcjZn
Observer has been doing good journalistic work about the protest on their Instagram
should i go to Western Reserve University or Case Institute of Technology 🥺
Like brother 😭
I chose cwru 💀
Or even the opposite
Like that CMU or cwru post
Like that ones mildly understandable
Or the uroch vs cwru one
WHY would you spend an extra 72k on uroch
The posts do get a little annoying especially because you can just search past posts on the subreddit lol
But also, I just scroll past usually
all my other schools were bums
Case can definitely be pretty generous with scholarships and grants
which was really nice
Yo, THE Dr. Cerf is the speaker for CWRU 2024 commencement? Thatâ€™s cool
Same
I think they automatically include federal loans as part of your "ability to pay" and generally expect you to take them out
i think it wouldâ€™ve been fully covered if I had a larger merit aid
it was 13K after all grants + merit
and then I had a DeWine scholarship 5K yr + 2K stem award yr

Yeah
They coulda given a lil more
😞
ur merit is massive
dangggg
I have no idea why they gave me that much
what was ur sai?
-1500
On grant the amount makes sense
But merit
i have -1500 sai
but they gave me 44K in grant
I guess they just try to keep the people with -1500 hovering around 11k or something
😭

Wait a minute
Oh I just added the thing to my profile
The scholarship they gave was so big, it made my decision easy bcz thereâ€™s no way I could afford uroch
Uroch was the only private university that denied me 💀
uroch is mid
same 💀
its also v depressing up there, its gloomy all the freaking time
I would've applied to uroch
Maybe that's why cwru let me in it's a perfect fit we both despise supps
i remember one of the prompts was barely coherent
applied mathematics to be specific 😏
🤮
I applied as a Engineering/CS major
and have a dislike for it
so now I am switching my major 😃
@reddishlightning is the intro course of CS at case similar to AP CSA?
It goes into more depth I hear but I skipped it
@dborhegyi knows a lot more about it than I do
DiD SoMeBodY SaY CsDs 132?????
You also make some really interesting projects and it's taught in the fall by a GOATed professor (Connamacher)
I programmed a lot in high school so I skipped it with basically no consequence
I had a lot of coding experience, but none with Java so it was a fun but challenging class for me and I learned a ton
I understand Java itâ€™s just when it comes to writing code like FRQs I struggle
Out of curiosity, why take CSDS 132 if youâ€™re a math major
Are you thinking something CSy as well
not 100% sure on either
thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking
LETâ€™S GO
Well thatâ€™s what your first year or two is all anout
Figuring it out
I was not having it with calculus in high school
NOT METH
convergence/divergence absolutely killed my grade
💀
yeah. Better to take the class and struggle and have a good support network of TAs and a good teacher etc. as opposed to skipping the class and be launched into another class where you DEFINITELY won't know the stuff

😭
agreed
if you ever want help understanding that kind of stuff let us know. There are a nonzero number of m~~e~~ath nerds in this server
Just Jake
Maybe someone else
Not sure if anyone tbh
Good luck soldier
I will take your word
132 and 233 (and other courses like 221 and 293) are very practical and coding-oriented, but higher courses like 310, 391, 386, etc. are a lot of mathy stuff
Those are algorithms, AI, and quantum computing respectively
So if you like math then those courses will be quite nice
Am I going to be applying any calculus to these classes?
AI requires calculus to some extent
But knowing calculus is important
twinning.
Practice makes it better
calc is necessary for fourier stuff too yeah?
Yup
In this case itâ€™s calculus
Iâ€™m about to accept my fate in Calc BC rn
did you do ab before bc?
Yeah
i was gonna say focus down the AB subsection if not
I think I might have to revisit AB stuff
Like the basics
a lot of it can be written on one side of a sheet of A4 paper
just remember your derivative and integral rules
and that's like half the battle
know how to take a derivative and integral, and know exactly what they mean. Know what they mean so well that when AP gives you weird problems you can always trust yourself on what the meaning of any integral or derivative is. Everything else in AB tends to follow pretty quickly from that
I understood precalc and physics
But simple algebra and geometry
Just took macro
Ist over fÃ¼r mich
my roommate came in as cs, took 233 first sem (aped out of 132) and promptly changed her major lol
Did you deserve it?
Yah the inflation gdp one was goofy
I put my energy into micro and it showed
security line is so long
oh wait
i read that as "im at cleveland hopkins"
my layover is ohare
Same
But it boards in like 15 min so weâ€™re chilling
my commonapp personal statement was about sleeping overnight in ohare layover lmao
traumadumping
Yeah thatâ€™s kinda weird ngl
How good is the student life at Case compared to like OSU?
What kind of student life?
like social life to be specific
Iâ€™ve met really really good people at case. My idea of fun is not necessarily normal (Iâ€™d usually rather watch lord of the rings than go to a party), but for me, my social life has been good. Overall, there are definitely a ton of introverts and a few shut-ins, but if you want to make friends thereâ€™s no shortage of really nice people
Iâ€™d say itâ€™s just a different kind of social life. At OSU (at least I assume) itâ€™s prob heavier on the parties. At Case u will get people playing dnd and board games. There was one night I stayed up till 5 am playing Avalon (it was quite fun). Also there are a lot of people who play video games. Parties exist at Case but I have never been to one so I canâ€™t tell u  much about them
Iâ€™m at Gate b2 of cleveland Hopkins
just gotta seek out the right people
i am now at chicago o'hell
If youâ€™re on campus youâ€™re relegated to fraternities or off campus homes
With freshmen forced on campus housing, youâ€™ll either love/hate the cramped 3 AM hangouts with 5 other people in the same room.
OSU, CSU are your best choices nearby
maybe kent
John Carroll is a bunch of suburban wash outs
Being a student athlete would also help socially I assume?
A LOT
Student athlete is probably best option for all avenues
Definitely Iâ€™d say
You coming in for varsity/D3?
Yes track and field
Nice youâ€™ll meet lots of cool people
Word
Congrats!
Also joining clubs will help - I met a lot of my close friends through bgc
When I get on campus I wanna meet all of yaâ€™ll personally
I need some new friends 😭
like being an athlete helped get out of the zone
I will say that youâ€™ll find the craziest events with groups you donâ€™t expect
itâ€™s just there was always a barrier interacting with others
Real
College youâ€™ll get a chance to cast a wide net
Try new things
Thatâ€™s what I wanna do
Well if youâ€™re still down for CWRU come fall, maybe Iâ€™ll see you. Enjoy summer while it lasts
One of my frat brothers is in track and field if youâ€™d like to talk to him
About what itâ€™s like at Case that is
o7
talk to people! Come to events! Iâ€™m happy to meet anyone who wants once Iâ€™m back on campus. Iâ€™ll be there during orientation week
I would be happy to meet all of you
Iâ€™ll be there when people meet Adam to make sure he doesnâ€™t get too nerdy
Jake and I will be living in a gorgeous house on Northside which is right next to the freshman dorms
This is true
No way
I am fiiiiine
When more rush details are finalized Iâ€™ll be posting something abt some events for that and Iâ€™d assume the DU folk will do the same as well as any other Greek orgs who are represented here. Rush events are a nice way to meet people (source: oops I joined a frat)
But pretty much every club will have some sort of interest meeting pretty early into the year
Also as a Greek life member I will be helping with freshman move in so if yâ€™all need your bags moved in it might be me
Other Greek life members in this server may or may not do the same
Iâ€™d like to as well
I will also be helping
Itâ€™d be great to when I get to campus
yes please 🙏
^
^
Alright, Iâ€™ll make note of that. Iâ€™ll DM you guys closer to move-in
Josh am I going to have to help you lug at least 3 fridges up flights of stairs on move in 😭
Yes please
At least 4*
Iâ€™m not 100% sure on the exact number or if they all work but I can probably guarantee 4 or 5
Lmfao
Best to share a fridge for freshman year btw unless you will keep it full yourself. Thereâ€™s limited space in freshman dorms and every square foot counts
Yea speaking of limited space, please do not bring 7 carfuls of stuff
Less is more when it comes to move-in imo
I took with me 3 suitcases and my backpack and I was happy
Counterpoint: Bring fans. Bring fans. Bring fans. Have a fan
i lied, my roommate is bringing one w her, so you can get rid of my request lol
A single box fan is usually sufficient for a room, you can also buy one in Cleveland if youâ€™re flying in
Countercounterpoint: convince your roommate to bring a fan. Have your roommate bring a fan. Have your roommate bring a fan.
But otherwise yeah. I came with a lot of bags but I used everything
True
Yeah. Buy what you plan to use
And if you have any questions if smth is useful, ask
Personally, no. Especially while youâ€™re on meal plan
I live in central columbus so I have the option to bring my car up
alrighty
Buses in Cleveland are pretty good to get into the city and to campus
buses can take you anywhere up to SOM ctr rd
Very easy. @indiance went to a few basketball games and can prob tell u more of the process
is the brita filter a must?
Yes
I think the tap water is fine tbh
thereâ€™s water fountains with the water bottle filler right?
Yes
Tons and tons of those things
very nice
i like the hydration station water
Due question actually
Are shower shoes needed for the shower
yes
Yes.
yes
lol instant response
Also in terms of social life, I will say that personally I've been able to make my social life exactly how I like it. Mostly small hangouts, some bigger events and performances, a few off campus things here and there, some regular meetings and events, and occasional house parties and such
Shower shoes are good because athletes foot and related ailments spread like wildfire otherwise
Yes
Use shower shoes
I had buckeye boys state at Miami U. and iâ€™ll sure say the dorm shower floors were not it 😭
What is buckeye boys state lmao
Itâ€™s a mock simulation government
think model UN/ high stakes student government but for rural ohio
Ah I see
1 week where we play puppets as government officials
I know some guys who go to Miami, they like to party lol
you shouldâ€™ve wentttt
it was fun
Sounds similar to Model Un
it was a lot of effort for very little benefit to me personally
you elect each other to fill the government positions in Ohio
Cool
I think itâ€™s Model UN
never done it but yeah
it's the same idea, different scope/scale
They held one at Case
also if you're in Columbus for the summer we could probably meet up for lunch or something sometime, particularly if you have more questions @dn121
letâ€™s do it
@tazmania40 you been to north market?
many a time
thereâ€™s also a daves hot
ah
got confused for a sec
or wherever you prefer
we can logistics it out later. I gotta be up early tomorrow for a robotics comp at my old hs
word
It was also a poorly ventilated and very old building
But it was our home 😭
rahhhhhh 🦅
any of yaâ€™ll been to Tensuke Market?!
I gotta share all these hidden spots
yessss
belleâ€™s bread my beloved
AHHHH
the strawberry cake is so light and good 😋😋
ooo i gotta try it sometime
i just filled my cup/water bottle from the water fountain on my floor and was totally fine. a brita would just be another thing to wash, as far as iâ€™m concerned
Ok I just officially committed LFG
congrats!!
Epic moment 😎
CONGRATS
congrats
Erm actually I was an 04 baby
Younger than me = literal infant
cavs games are very accessible you have the option of taking the red line or the healthline. Baseball is pretty much in a similar spot so you have to take the same transportation

yea and I'm pretty sure RTA also goes there
I was born 2007 man
Wild
Skipped 3rd grade
Iâ€™m 17 lol
Ah, I get it
Yessir
When were you born?
2003
Also is there a warhammer group I can learn to play
join tabletop empire it's our board game club discord it should be on cwru hub
Okay sweet, thanks.
👍🏼
https://discord.gg/mtAu5VpG
There are 386 until June 1, 2025. Please spend it wisely and with your loved ones

If anyone wants it in a more spread out way haha
Dang, engineers know how to be efficient
Iâ€™m about to just take this L
Itâ€™s joever and thatâ€™s ok
Exactly Iâ€™ve reached the acceptance stage
I tried my best and thatâ€™s good enough 😭
Guys the curve is crazy
Whatâ€™s the curve?
Is it this
Iâ€™ve accepted the fact that I am going to get a 1 on AP Physics C
😎
We can suffer and disappoint ourselves together 🍻
Letâ€™s goo
Ye
Granted it changes slightly every year
Insane that people made this stuff
🤷â€â™‚ï¸
imma get a 1 on physics C E&M
im hoping to get a 5 on mech but im screwed for e&m
or dont come back and get the points that you know you can get lol
yes 💀
Btw your rabbit is really cute
who r u lil bro
Lil bro
sammyd17 on instagram
We follow each other and I recognized your name
Summer program there
ty hes a shelter bunny i volunteer
ohh
NJ Scholars
nice
Are you from Jersey?
no
delaware
💀
Lmao how do you know about Lville
i applied in 9th grade
i had no clue what i was doing
Lmao
i started witha  greys anatomy quote and thought it was the most original thinhg ever
Qb?
quizbowl
like academic bowl
Iâ€™m in quizbowl
oh no way
cool
LOL
Wdym by read for choate rosemary hall
im a reader
i moderate for my team
cuz im dookie at non fine arts questions
Lville has a beautiful campus though
Chat how was Calc?
Iâ€™m just so happy itâ€™s over
Lowkey kinda light
If any phys mech kids would like to review in the vc tonight lmk
I took calc AB and it was pretty light
Do you like
Typically know who your roommate is before move in day
Or do you both just show up
Cause I'm not gonna do any of the requesting stuff I know exactly 0 people going to this school
the housing application has features that let you filter through potential roommates and message them
mine found me through there~
is it open?
Yes, even if you go random you will be informed of who your roommate is before move in day
Also, at least at case, you can change your major whenever you want. You can be pre-med as any major, so why is the decision necessary now?
I thought the deadline was May 1st?
i extended all of em
to 15
I see
Well what are the pros and cons of each?
Madison in state, good enginerring, more social. Case good access to volunterrung &resrarch for premed. Liberal arts college easier GPA for premed., close (maybe a con)
am i cooked?
What's the cost differential?
Also, how easy to change your mind at each?
the cost of premed and the time commitment will likely change your mind, I would say whereever you go try shadowing a doc see if you like it, try going into some specific field of research for engineering, you have to walk the path to see if you like it
i thunk thats a good idea, buy hy specific resrarch @gnp4736251
I think it may be unwise to expect you'll stick to whatever career path you choose under pressure tonight
But Madison is still a great school
fuk, thabks for the advice it actually helps alot and i can usr as talking points.
research is a good indicator since if it feels like a drag or chore the whole way through or are you yourself chasing random tangents or rabbit wholes out of genuine curiosity. As for what specific research asking chatgpt certain questions might land you a list where you can choose what appeals to you most
I would say a very large portion of people I know in college have changed their major since entering
And it was super easy to change my mind at Case
Also, just speculating, but it would probably be way easier to transfer from case to Madison than the other way around if you realize you made the wrong decision
Yeah ur right, thats something ive thought about
Mr. Charlie do you know any way I can connect to grad students? Like a server or something I want to delve into specific fields asap
I personally know a few people in graduate programs I could connect you to, but I don't know of any special discord servers or anything
I think I might flip a coin chat
hi
Hello
my name is tyler and im committed for computer science for class of 2028. nice to meet you guys.
No way it's another Tyler!!!
Infinite Tyler glitch
nice to meet you tyler
hi other Tyler
See you already fit in just great
Lol
Lmao
💀
Bruh
anyone else take phys mech today?
My brother did
Our teacher said that we will only ever have to integrate a rod about a certain point so he never taught us how
im thinking 3/4 range
ah yeah
I definitely got a 1 on e&m
I just gave up half way through 💀
what is the averagr case student like
like socially
Hard to really pin down lol, there's a lot of variety. I would say the average person is like 4/10 in terms of extroversion
Average person is a 4?
Most people are happier with a smaller group of friends
is the student body diverse
4/10 where 1 is super introvert and 10 is super extrovert
In what way?
like racr/ethnicity
Racially? Decently yes, but could be better
There's a lot of white people and Asians
only asking cuz i come from a rural city in wisconsin
There are many Black, Hispanic, and Native people, but they're not the majority
I will say a lot of the Asian students are international though, which skews things a bit
whats the tolerance for like kind of weird, kind of goofy people? or is it pretty serious
I would say there are more weird/goofy people than incredibly serious ones
I found it not too hard to find a group of people who would accept and appreciate my strangeness and quirks
I think most students here at weird in at least one way
But most are decently well adjusted to society
like in a scale from 1 (being nerdy) to 10(being normal), what are students like
Im about to say.... im kinda nerdy and i hope im normal
💀
oh shoot. Not to be rude or anything but im guesisng the average person would correct youe grammar or smthn then?
Youâ€™re*
No one does that
I think case students are definitely nerdier than students at like, OSU, and probably like to party a bit less
But most people are just normal with maybe like a slightly unusual hobby or interest they're really into
😭
specially charlie, u tha goat
Thanks haha
Charlie is the goat frfr
I mean, college is a good opportunity to branch out of your community
Not everyone is like a big city person
In my opinion I think there's a group for everyone at Case, but I'm prolly biased just because I am definitely someone who struggled to belong in high school but found it way better at Case
im sort of like the high school jock who has a huge rostar and such
There are a lot of athletes at Case
so may be an adjustment
There are lots of social, extroverted people (like me) and also a place for people who aren't. Lots of student athletes and active club teams, but also people who don't even like walking around campus
or 'brother'
I've said much sillier things
lmfao naw everyone i know does that
Yeah I was pretty popular and then I did the finger thing and now ive been a bit outcast my senior year
Finger thing? Huh
â˜ï¸
erm actually
Ah
I think it would be very hard to be a social outcast at Case, the only people I know who are really disliked is because they are cruel or mean to others
Thanks for the big tip Charlie
Actually goos advices
I think it's also not that easy to be "popular" as Case, just because it's a big school, most people are just average in being popular vs unpopular
I am decently well known just because I try to be friendly to everyone and go to a decent amount of clubs
I just have a bigger social circle than a lot of my close friends
Id say about 2% of my high school knows mr
so pretty decent
Mostly seniors
When I was a senior
Most people start out not knowing anyone and they are kinda desperate to make friends
That's just part of college 😭
But I hope my advice and other ramblings has been helpful to you, whether you decide case is right for you or not
How do most people get friends... beyond just meeting people in classes
emulate my behavior
dorm buildings
Thanks for the big tips charlie, I think i may choose case
lmao yeah 😭 you'll be living around these ppl so you might as well get to know them
ive never really met asian people so thatll be cool
https://tenor.com/view/quby-high-five-wave-pentol-qubysani-gif-19935273
nice to meet ya
your first asian experience
Dorms, clubs, events, and friends of acquaintances mostly
XD
how long u been at case Charlie? like 5 years or so? u seem to know alot
Explore events are good too now that those are a thing. Met two of my closest friends at an English explore event
I made one friend freshman year because during o-week I saw him playing on the giant chess board in thwing and I said "man, you're so unhinged, I love the energy" and thus began a beautiful friendship
I gotta know who
Ah gotcha
I just finished my sophomore year
So I'll be around
i just finished my senior year hah
But yeah I'm halfway through my time at Case, which is weird to say
I also went to a board games event and then it took me to glee club
In a lot of ways, I've found that just being kind to others and open to new experiences makes college life a lot more enjoyable
And if any of y'all freshman want to meet me during o-week just let me know lol, I'll probably be helping with move-in so I'll be there
You can be like "woah this Charlie guy is way shorter than I thought he'd be"
Seconded. I know Adam will be there as well
And you can meet Jake and be like "woah that discworld tattoo is cool as fuck"
how tall r u
I'm like 5'4 lmao
bruh
And then you can be like â€œwoah this guy is the same height as Charlieâ€
i'm 6'2.5
5â€™4 gang
So true
ur 5'4 too?
Me and Jake are outliers
I know way more tall people
hol up this is a factor
jk
I swear the avg height of my fraternity is like 5'11
There are plenty of giants
im pretty built too
D/s/b? (Joking)
Kind of true
Marcus and Owen definitely bring up your avg
Eric too
And Nico now
Oh yeah Nico is tall ASF
Sometimes I forget when I don't see him for a while
He does not have 6'5 energy
not more people being over a foot taller than me 😭
Lol
She's 5'
awww thats nice to know xd
And she used to play basketball
._.
In high school
(in Indonesia)
oh okay that makes more sense 💀
Lmao yeah
Do you have any advice to add after your first year Lindsey?
not much i can add beyond what you already covered tbh :3
just really take o week as your chance to be as unnaturally sociable as you can and talk to every person you meet, you'll make so many friends
also take this summer to relax~~ ya'll have already made it and it's about your last chance to just let loose 🩷
wait have we met ever, Jake?
I will also be around during move in/o week so if yall run into me, say hello!
I'll be with the DU boys for move in and then intermittently on the quad that week for my research post so let me know if you're around
Hello, Tyler! 👋
I love living in EST and sleeping like I live in PST
also if any  engineering first years are in ENGR 145 then there's a chance I'll be your TA lol
Yeah I believe so. Have you seen your gavel recently?
It is safe and sound
Saaaaame
I love living in PST (California W)
Real
Pst best timezone
Est is better
:caret:
this.

Oh god
💀
To do better ig
Yeahhh 😭 lol
Just know what u know and do ur best
Potentially
Placement test is to put you in an ideal place for you
New information will come from a place called College
But I'd rather not be put in precalc again
Yeah if anything just brush up ur algebra and trig skills then
If you have taken precalc, just refresh some old concepts and you'll be fine
So enjoy that for people who have a 5 on ab or bc
Only dual enrollment
That stuff
I've also had friends who needed to take precalc and no one's ever given them shit for it
My email they said I was signed up for something on canva
The cwru one
Almost all classes use canvas as a primary point of contact though
It would be so cool if we could like start looking over slides 😭
huh ok then

A lot of professors get shuffled in the courses they're teaching each semester, so some will remake all of the teaching tools
Thanks, Bob 🤞
Just wait until you get the daily
💀
I check my email pretty often anyway so
Right now I'm getting harassed by Sallie Mae about loans
My mom briefly worked in a Sallie Mae call center when she was younger
Truly a miserable place
"congratulations, you've been invited to go into debt!"
Sallie Mae is THE student loan company they are so excited for you to go into debt
Well not private loan debt
I'm not counting the FAFSA that's miniscule in comparison
The subsidized loans are fine tbh
Would you also opt out because of test scores
?
I mean SAT, ACT
stuff like that
I'm not sure, maybe?
I know some schools do
im in an ap calc ab equiv course and am doing well? idk if that would change things
I'm pretty sure credit being acquired is what removes the requirement
Unless another case exists like test scores
yea im not sure
Iâ€™m gonna fight the admissions peeps
I asked abt my app and all they said was youâ€™ll get it when you get it
ohhhhh that was you...
yeah I'm Eric's little and Sophie's friend if that helps
Depends on your major
Well, you get credit for calc 1 and 2. Iirc the main majors requiring more than that are engineering, math, physics, and cs. Probably data science and statistics as well. If none of those are your intended major, you're probably safe, but double check the major bulletin just in case
what did yall do to register for military service
ik its required but im not sure on the details
dubs 🙏🙏
https://www.sss.gov/
guys the math placement test is free youâ€™ll be fine
itâ€™s just to test out of precalc
anything beyond that requires transfer credit or a designated placement test
how do you know if you have it
the test
itâ€™ll be on the road map
ok
was graduation today?
the it page was posting all about it
Yup
convocation was today, start of graduation celebrations
actual graduation ceremony is sunday
but also adam I'm not done you know this
taking one more course over the summer
What is a convocation I am so confused
honestly
could not tell you
there were some speeches
Fun
it's a lot of the "graduation speeches" I guess
Yippee
and then they split up the graduation ceremonies for the different schools
Thatâ€™s thoughtful and interesting
Well congrats on convocation
thank you thank you
they let you walk in the spring if youâ€™re not quite done yet?

yeah, @cygnusxxii
they only have graduation ceremonies in the spring so if you are graduating in the coming summer or fall you can walk before you graduate
ah i see
@sophie vc
best advice I can give to any incoming freshman
is ping @cygnusxxii whenever possible in any server
makes any day better
tysm I'll ask him, also what's your impression of the astronomy minor I'm heavily considering it
do you know what youâ€™re gonna major in?
biochem
that's reassuring thank you
you can double count the required intro physics sequence for that towards the astro minor (iâ€™m pretty sure) so itâ€™s a 9 credit minor which should be quite doable
OH THAT'S RIGHT!!! My apologies
*its spreading*
this is why I'm debating walking spring '25 and graduating fall '25
Just out of curiosity, which of our non-current* Case students saw the eclipse and how was it from yâ€™allâ€™s areas
I only saw a partial eclipse in socal and it was pretty interesting, im sure it didnt compare to a full
partial - 90% totality. it was surprisingly normal! it got dim but not really dark at max coverage and the birds got confused, but that's it really 🙂
Loke
An expensive one
It has begun
Yall the Sears building is pretty gnarly
I got an honor grad band and a pin for getting over a million in scholarships
I put the pin on the band
also windows > mac because of weird software for multiple classes
i would personally recommend checking out some linux distros and seeing if you like them because in some cases working from linux can make your life a lot easier
Oh right
Eugh
Probably not a super expensive one. Get one that is built to last, runs windows, and is at least somewhat customizable. For example, one that you can add more ram to
if you are fine with how few ports it has i will heavily shill framework from a moral perspective
Whatâ€™s it for
Or rather, whoâ€™s it for
An email about a canvas update
Oh my case email?
Yes
The canvas thing is literally just an update about canvas
Itâ€™s hidden in the middle of the email

This was it for me
Preferred name questions
Eugh
I mean I do have one but I'm prob not gonna put it on something official
preferred name is how professors will see you on rosters and SIS. If you have a name you prefer to your legal name, I'd recommend putting it down sooner rather than later cause otherwise your legal name will probably be printed on stuff
Preferred name can show up on canvas, when you're being emailed (though it doesn't change your case id), and on the front of your student ID
If you have a name you would prefer to be known as, I would recommend adding it as a preferred name. But I can understand that things can be more complex
All official documentation uses your legal name so dw about that
That is also true
Writing seminar
:eyes_hmm:
tell me why we need to write an essay for this
I'm still pretty sure they don't actually read the essays
Vaguely gives you a sense of what AIQS could look like and gives the writing department an idea of how you write
Man
Thought I was done w those for a while
no one reads the essays lol
i strongly recommend the topical one if youâ€™re a functional english speaker
hi guys, does anyone know why im unable to access the housing application link that was sent out today?
i just see this 😭
https://cwru.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/0ABDDD63/7/9/Home-Home?UrlToken=376F0711
This one should take u to the right page
You gotta make ur caseone id first tho to get applying for housing
ohhhhh
Btw I love ur tbhk pfp
OH IT WORKS
TYTYY
No prob â¤ï¸
yoooo omg fellow tbhk fan??
YEAH!!!!
yayayay
HAHAHAHA
wait does the housing application include dorm selection
or is that later
This is a question for the upperclassmen lol
oh hahaha
Application first. Youâ€™ll say you want to live in a double and choose meal plan and your roomies and stuff. Dorm comes later
ah okok ty
wait can you change photos 💀
mine is horrendous
oh god
That's rough buddy
nooooooo
But here's the thing
Who looks at your Case ID photo? Literally no one
Everyone's id photo is kind of ass lol
It's like a rite of passage
ah okay hahaha
that's a relief 🤣
No one cares
Is it a jpeg?
There's a list of photo requirements
https://case.edu/access-services/case1card/photos
Yup
has anyone completed the housing application?
https://i.imgur.com/QG78546.png
absolutely no idea what to select lmao
actually
im going with the max meal plan thats like $150 casecash on it by default right
I use a lot of case cash each semester, but that's because I don't have meal swipes and like getting food at places around campus
correct- tbh $150 was enough for me but some people use case cash way more
Think about it this way, $150 will buy 30 single scoops of Mitchell's ice cream
50 dunkin large refreshers
case cash carries over right
:D
yeah
:waaah:
I'm sure admin will provide you all spacious cardboard boxes to live in
Clarke Pit opening soon
Case cash should be renamed Mitchellâ€™s cash at least with the way I spend it
SO TRUE
the only other place is like Einstein's bagels at Nord
I have spent a lot of case cash at Einstein's
And at falafel cafe
Is there any pro to using case cash over normal cash
no
think of case cash as just your ID becoming a debit card but only for specific locations
I'm glad this lore has survived
In general case cash is excused from sales tax
But not all places follow that
It's considered an educational expense if you're withdrawing money from a college fund
Tax write off?
Massive bruh moment
Wtf wait
So should I be getting case cash or not 😭😭
whatttt
...
Itâ€™s on the tax form the university gave you
Shows total scholarships and tuition
am i suppose to fill that out myself...?
or they send a letter to me?
They sent out an email about 2023 1098-Ts in January
to student email?
Yes
why is usa so complicated
🫠
😢
ok
its qualified spending right
no so tax right
Thx
anyone going to madrid?
i had a question about the documents i had to send
im sending them my passport and the visa application + the photos but did they want the letters as well or just online
My picture
🧍
I just wanna get my housing
The only things I can do rn are like
And I am not doing that for like atleast another week
I think that one specifically is manual, because some of the things I did today were received
They responded to my disability form within like
Wait wdym by reply
Like in the disability portal or via email
By email
They responded telling me everything I needed and stuff
I just gotta get my doctor's to write letters
I sent the stuff in the portal and got emailed later
Can I dm you
Sure
yall seen my goat usyk win
Wait yeah I also said I had a surgery at one point and now they need the info ?
For me it's just me being deaf
I gotta get my audiologist to write a letter explaining some stuff to them
Ah, are you gonna need like an interpreter for classes and such?
Probably not I'm not that deaf
"moderately-severe hearing loss"
If anything I'll just hope to get versions of the lectures with transcripts w them if possible
Speaking of do most cwru classes require attendance in your guy's experience
Depends on the department
My sages type and humanities classes have required attendance
Please please attend
Unless you have a good reason not to
I usually attend but I'm just wanting to figure out if I'll be penalized if I dont
Some professors grade based on attendance and participation, some will use clickers or quizzes, and others don't really care
Is this the same at case western?
or are they not recorded?
Some are recorded, many are not
I would still strongly recommend going anyway
I've had maybe 2 profs that recorded lectures out of the 2 years I've been taking classes
Most professors at case do not record lectures ime, and it's very common for people to be like "oh I'll just watch the recording later" and then never watch it
@roguish_raven
ok so thats better than hs
😭
Yeah you spend way less time in class vs high school
But I would say lessons tend to be more intense and full of information
how often do you rely on google/ai to help understand concepts
iâ€™ve been using google/ai more this past year to help with senior yr like comp sci stuff and calc
Personally, AI has proven pretty useless for me as a learning/debugging/idea generating tool. Google is definitely a good tool if you know how to use it. Iâ€™ve spent a good amount of time on Wikipedia pages for linear algebra concepts to try and get some examples that werenâ€™t in my textbook. If you have a good textbook, use that first. Then, it really depends on the class and problem (I.e. if youâ€™re looking for an intro physics example problem or a pdf of some poem Google is probably a great place to go. If youâ€™re looking for a specific and recent experiment or an interpretation of a creative work, Iâ€™d recommend actual published articles (learn to use the research databases!) or asking a friend/professor)

Tl;dr AI bad and is a waste of your time. Google is nice if you know how and when to use it, but professors, friends, and databases are often better

i like how they have a placeholder text here
(multi billion dollar endowment college btw)
😭
true!
oh yeah that is very true
from what i remember linalg and abstract are the classes that make math majors reconsider their life choices
For some, it was quite the opposite
ok mr double bubble jr
Skull emoji
Wow, youâ€™re so cool Adam
Complex analysis and scientific computing also made me question my life choices
Can't wait for real analysis 1 and abstract next semester
Amazingly based

does this mean that renter's insurance is required in order to have housing?
Bruh thereâ€™s more?
No, there is no actual requirement for it

I would love to spend my summers developing stuff for games
💀
They are
It shows that you can develop software and manage a large codebase
Not to mention showing that youâ€™re proficient in the technologies you use
they approved my card
:angelpraise:
No lmao they just trynna scam
ah i see haha

which real analysis section?
Roysdon
damnit
infinite roysdon glitch nobody is taking werner :(
I have a lot of other required classes next semester lol
convexity and optimization?
Measure theory
ooh seems fun
I hope it will be
measure theory is part of real analysis right?
Yes
ooh i'll perhap take that at some point
Measure theory? What about a ruler, ever heard of it? :CB_wheeze:
:edgy:
Lmao true
mathematicians are anarchists you heard it here folks
👀 who are you talking those with?
i am in both classes
Roysdon and Juan
I think we'll be taking abstract together at least
HUGE
i am in both of those classes
The irony of this is that Roysdon tells people to call him by his first name Mike and Orendain is called Dr. Orendain by default
having friends in classes goes crazy
On god
Ah, my mistake. Mike and Dr. Orendain
Big
Lol I'm just joshing
Yeah I figured you were fucking with me lol
Everyone calls him Juan
Not to his face
But Roysdon does explicitly tell people to not call him Dr. Roysdon
This might sound stupid but I have not been able to physically bring myself to call him by his first name so I simply ... have not addressed him by name
Interesting
Eeps department is cool because pretty much every prof has you call them by their first name
I mean it is how people talk *about* them but not *to* them
Like I message my advisor like "hi Steve"
Nevermind
Housing app has opened

How many extracurriculars would ya'll say is the max?
On a weekly basis
depends on what they are and how many classes you're taking and how you prefer to spend your free time (there is no real answer)
different extracurriculars are also very different time commitments
WAIT IM IN ESSEX TOO
WAIT
WHAT PART
why are the closest friends always the farthest away

MILLBURN wait i wonder if this counts as doxxing myself
Me when cracked fencing team
Maybe
I'd say the average person at case probably has one or two clubs or extracurriculars they're passionate about
Ok gotcha and thanks
You will probably have time to explore things, but probably not enough time to commit to everything

Ayy congrats!
Congraduations!
Congrats!!
Had to switch it to the grad pun 😭
Obviously I did
Time to do it all over again 😎
congrats!!
GG
Congrads!!!
One thing I will
Is the HEAT
My graduation 2 years ago it was 105
And direct sunlight 😭
:0
This is so true
I'm from Wisconsin and we joke about 4th winters (happens way too often)
https://i.imgur.com/hptjeE2.png
I mean I grew up in nyc before i moved to south carolina
eh
thats not that fast
100 wpm
https://i.imgur.com/BfOl3PB.png
they think im cheating 😭
its just to make sure
because nobodys gonna cheat under 100 wpm
i used to be a big typing guy
where our weekly quiz was to do a typing test
I think in 8th grade i peaked at like 84 wpm
nice
I type like 60wpm at my peak lol
in minecraft uhc if you are underground, you have to keep crouching to hide your nametag
so to type to teammate you have to uncrouch, speedrun your dm to your teammate, and resume crouching
thats why i got fast lmao
I played bedwars a lot
I type like 160 on monkeytype
nice
Average person types like 40wpm
how is that even possible
💀
She types with only one hand 😭
i type with index and middle fingers on both hands
?????
4 fingers total, 5 if you count ring finger as I use that to backspace
avg wpm is like 120-130
i also type with right arm tilted at like a 45 degree angle
Imagine if you learned touch typing
i can send a vid
my high school friends told me i was committing war crimes
Keep in mind that 60wpm means typing one word every second, which isn't exactly easy
Tbf I type with like 7 fingers

@gwineafowl thoughts?
why are you as fast as me with half the fingers 💀
Ngl kind of similar to how I type but I use a few more fingers
lmfao
how do u like index to space
theyre all lousy
and dry
and gross
f1 mentioned?!?!?!
YES
a bit out of it right now but i have a similar way of typing
i need to learn to touch type
Yeah mine is also reasonably similar
I could just never master the skill of touch typing lol
Idk I struggle a lot with mastering fine motor skills
just takes a lot of practice
Such is the case with many things
lando norris on top
85-95 wpm

I mean I usually type without looking much but not with this very complex finger pattern lol
so you mean like homerow typing?
honestly its really common for people not to use rshift
yeah. touch typing is generally defined as no looking + use homerow
interesting
It's the one where you start on the middle row and all of your fingers have assignments, then you type without looking
I think the time it would take me to learn would struggle to be worthwhile
yeah tahts what homerow is
honestly its overrated
in general, the fastest typing will be achieved by 
a) muscle memory
b) the use of more fingers (up to a point)
c) better keyboard layouts :(

home row typing is just one technique for that that works for a ton of people (myself included)
like if dvorak or colemak were so much better than qwerty then there should be more fast people on those layouts
I was thinking about steno but ye
madman behavior
they should make steno for latex
https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/how-bad-is-qwerty-really-a-review-of-the-literature-such-as-it-is/
Interesting lit review on the topic
It also took me a while to learn wasd lol
What do you mean? It's literally a difference, that's what a difference is
but its not significant
its significant to 80% confidence per the article
Anyway muscle memory is the most important
You'll type best in what you're used to
The other layouts also seem to have less strain on individual fingers but more pinky use (which wouldn't be good for me, since my pinkies are not useful)

I said it was a bit more efficient
Which it is
i suppose yeah
Very few people need to type at faster than maybe 60 or 70wpm on a daily basis
yeah typing speed is funny that way considering how it isnt an accurate description of how fast youll be typing day to day
mm i did forget other layouts will require less finger movement to type certain words
dvorak and colemak and similar layouts are honestly better for ergonomics than speed
Yeah, that's one of their selling points
Lol I do know wasd now but it took me a really long time to get decent at
My hands are a bit smaller than average I think
But I have long fingers
Just makes all the angles weird
I read this as having more fingers, maybe that is the secret key we need octopus hands or something
Somehow I don't think that extra fingers would have that big of an impact
We'd just have bigger keyboards
Fair just funny thought

The list of where people are going to school from my high school just came out
No one is going to Case 😭
Oh well
Same
Ive got one other person
i was the only one my year and now there's one more person this year
same no one to case
I think I'm the only one from my high school to go to case for several years lol
One other girl got accepted the same year as me but she got a better scholarship somewhere else
I got 49 WPM typing with just one hand
I think normally I'm like 120-ish
Crazy stuff
Do you actually type that fast for an essay for ex. Or is that just max speed
Thatâ€™s on the monkeytype settings for like the short words
For the 1000 word dataset Iâ€™m more like 100
Sometimes I be cooking on my essays
Sometimes not
Fyi there is a website for couch surfing, which is way cheaper than on-campus housing
also technically in accordance with CWRU housing laws, you could have others surf your place if they vacate within a few days
another piercing 😃
How many do u have :000
4 total!
:00 what kind of piercings?
That's so cool

looks bigger in the pic
but it looks nice irl
Weâ€™ve had exactly 1 person going every year lol
and I think thereâ€™s a senior too
That smiley earring looks so cute tho

im the only one from my hs so itâ€™s all good 💀
anyone play brawl stars
if so can u do this
1. flip a coin (heads = shelly, tails = jessie)
2. play two games of gem grab with the character you flipped, screenshotting your damage dealt after each match
3. play two games of gem grab with the other character after, screenshotting your damage after each match
4. send all screenshots to me when you have played all 4 games
There is a single other person going to ohio with me and they are going to ohio state. All of my friends who got into case also got into super good colleges, like ones going to Johns Hopkins, another is going to Emory, and the other is going to UCI
i gotchu
😭 same my stats teacher is making us make 2 mcq and an frq present to the class and make a video explaining the questions and answers
I am Suffering
using matched paies
Case does have a very low yield rate lol, the quintessential second choice
So I gotta say something, a bit of a darker side of Case at times
Wall of text incoming, but I feel quite strongly about this
Yeah I mean, it's not a top choice for a lot of people. But top choices and dream schools are kind of bullshit anyway imo. Like, it's a fantasy you get sold about a college being special and being the best time of your life. But really, it matters more what you put into college than the specific place you're at. Just make the most of it
Same all of the opportunities for nursing is what drew.me to Case in the first place
or chem
case was a school in my reaches when I was young, just not put on the pedestals like the ivies when talked about
my sister got into case as well so that drew me to apply
great for cs major + it snows in cleveland, what more could i ask for lol
Just because I applied to reaches mostly for the luls
It was the obvious choice when I did
I applied to two state schools and a bunch of reach schools that said they meet full need
I applied to a bunch of safeties hoping I could merit my way to a full ride
I did not
But then case accepted me so it was fine 😭
Luckily I am from a low tier state so my state school is pretty cheap
Yeah like my "first choice" was northeastern for no other reason than co ops and Boston
💀
Bawstin
I only applied to reaches because people kept telling me I should they weren't really a focused part of my application process
Reach schools smeach schools
like maybe if prestige matters but practically all schools offer most of the same things
or at least in the case of what i was looking for
i mean not everywhere has an astronomy major, so some programs def vary school to school (yay case)
@seduku idk when the enrollment deadline was 💀 you may be alright??
It was 15th
Am I cooked chat?
I would just like to say that people wearing other college merch is also a fashion thing, or just if you already had it for whatever reason
you may be a little cooked
Well ask the admissions office
Call tomorrow
thas crazy, may not be going to college
Definitely call tomorrow
Is fs the play
yuh i will fs
if you call, they can definitely get you in with some caveat or smth don't worry
Someone asked me why I was wearing another college's merch once and it was because I worked for them the preceding summer
Bruh it's been two weeks 😭
They may give you leniency but who knows, just call as others have suggested
Then yeah tell them that
I mean, if it was a medical emergency hopefully they will be lenient to you
Sometimes things happen that are out of your control
I sure hope not
It's also still May
Lets goo
Mccullo the goat
:bob:
:< no bob emoji
Send me a PNG of it and I will make it a server emoji
YIPPEE
We only have 4/50 at the moment so plenty of room
is putnam and beyond best book to stusy with

putman
im tryna get a 2 on it
:BobMcCulloughf:
:BobMcCulloughf:
become a quant later
SLAY
oh yeah
I did alright this past year
the median is 0
I got a 22 somehow
cap
Not cap
i know this uchicago grad who got a 7
22 is unhinged
I mean the year before that I got a 1
wait u must have been top 1000 then?
Yeah #706 actually
We're getting top 500 this year chat
r u gonna be a quant
No way
I'm going into academia is the plan
Quant is money but I've always liked teaching and whatnot
That's the plan 💪
crazy
Yeah but how good are you at scrabble? Mogged by ansel smh
So true lmfao
Ansell is the goat
I have zero interest in a finance career lol
how did case let me in with yall 💀
yall be like doing induction and stuff and im like "ape togather strong"
Tell me more about the pseudo rhombicuboctahedron
It's the only polyhedron to be debated as an Archimedean solid
Seduku should the admissions office smile upon you tomorrow, what do you want to major in
Well college develops your skills
(We'll all be praying for you don't worry)
prolly premed
Is what you care about money?
Because if so why not CS lmao
i get nauseous looking at computers too long
Find a new question then profit
On god
scrabble is sm fun
bloxus too if youve ever heard of it
excuse my swearing
Swearing is fine here as long as it's not egregious
Lmao you should probably just pick one thing
ill still takr the putnam but ill focus more on premed then
How else are you going to analyze data sets lol
So like sorting algorithms, if statements?
Not even the high level stuff
ill be fine then
I have no idea besides what I could Google on the topic, I have zero interest in the field
I mean it's your life
yessir
It's also pretty competitive
im a pretty competitive dude.
Im no adam but I am me
Adam is built different
I am good enough at math lol
Good enough to get a degree (I hope)
You know like what derivatives and induction is
Be yourself, and if you aim for the stars (quant) you'll end up pretty high up nonetheless
Also Adam is currently building a Minecraft starter base so you do not need to be Adam
dude yes Iwill shoott and I will be high
I just hope that Ill be making good money regardless of my career
I know a lot more than that friend
I even know the contrapositive
oh u mean "if you do not end up pretty high, you did not aim for the stars" type shiz?
thats the counterpositive right
Yes
Well yeah but if it's bleak that's because the original is cliche
For the contrapositive to be true the original statement also has to be true
They have the same truth value
Ah. I apoligizr for my dumbassery.
youâ€™re a mod ! be the change you want to see in the world
mod what? Mod 2? Im confused
typically a congruence is stated as x (mod k)
So true!
is this a clever way of saying im odd, i.e 1 (mod 2)
That's a ! not a 1
PÃ³g mo thÃ³in
They are both logic driven
Not necessarily so
So ...
My god he can spell lads, look at him go \<3
SEQUENTIALLY
Not all together
matthematics
:D
that was stellar
or
matthewmatics
Tbh I should get a science or something named after me
I'd be a great specimen of study
I have an idea for a name
Matthematics
Mmm
Maybe like
Mattonomics
Matthology
Softball
I got spoiled by living in south Carolina where like 80% of colleges id know of were d1 😭
i went to a football game (to see the marching band) and i mentioned this so someone and they like gaped at me
i think even for a d3 school we're not super engaged in sports lol
Yeah like with south Carolina
Mfs love USC and Clemson athletics
I know if I went there I would've had to go to a game by default just because there's no way I could've avoided being dragged to one
Case I really doubt it
If it's like a big championship game I might check one out though
yo theyre letting me in
lfg
I mean it's not exactly a big deal but I have never properly made friends with guys like ever 💀
Hopefully that changes at Case
Best of luck
NOOOOOOO
no idea tbh
My pronouns weren't even an option
So
💀💀
💀
Choose all of them
For the discovery week info there's an other option where you can put all ur pronouns :3 that's what I did
Yeah I'm probably gonna do that
did they say specifically that gih is in clarke this year? its been in cutler (cedar mag) for the past couple years afaik
im prob gonna look on reddit for what ppl say is generally the best one
Because it's got like 40 floors and only 2 elevators
ohhhh ok
It's 11 floors
And 2 elevators
😮
How is that up to the fire code? 
All the cedar mag dorms have 2 stair sets and only 4 floors
same with juniper
I think some of the dorms are just not up to snuff with fire code
Pretty sure it's just random 😭 so you just get kinda screwed
oh boy oh boy
It's nice that gender inclusive housing exists, but cwru's handling of it is not really adequate imo
considering im deaf
not great
Yeah 💀
Donâ€™t the alarms also make light?
Tbh I'm not even hoh and I slept through the fire alarm before
did u use the ap credit link
https://case.edu/admission/apply/ap-ib-college-credit
just check which ap's youve taken
Calc 3 / diffy you can test out of
I see that i mostly transfer since ive gotten 5s
It has 2 sets of stairs?
Wait fr?
Where's the other one
Is it just for emergencies
Itâ€™s towards the back
Where the 02 and 03 quads are
On each floor
Oh interesting
do people like me thrive at case
What are people "like you"
Yeah itâ€™s not clearly visible at a glance but you should notice if you spend more than a week at mist living there
i feel like you know from talking to me
like im kind of dumb as hell, but low key smart
high key insufferable, but low key funny
What would make you not thrive at Case
The second point is irrelevant
But define what you mean by "dumb as hell but low key smart"
im assuming not streetsmart but booksmart?
i feel like as long as your mindset is good you're set to thrive
its not entirely about environment
im well aware
im going to assume that this is the case anywhere else
pun intended
No one can predict what your experience at case will be like
A lot of it is entirely up to you
Do you visit the lake, is it fun?
its not like a fun spot to be
no like waterfront activities
not near case but lake erie does have a lot of parks along it with beaches and whenever i visit in the summer, its packed w ppl swimming and whatnot
headlands beach state park specifically
Handshake sending me an email about working with the LA police department
I think I'm okay
reminds me of one of my favorite posts like. ever
LMAOO YEAH
I've gotten some of those from indeed
@cawu do you two know each other or something
yes
Got my advisor
whatt
oh yeah me too
i got rose begalla
Gina Huffman
I'm probably not going to schedule a meeting
I don't actually have any questions lol
lol me either
Just your 4 year? Or premajor too
4 yr
We get the premajor during discover week
According to the email
whatt
wait fr? i thought you have to meet with your four year, at least in the summer
do they not do anything?
i got adam binkley
i met with her once in the summer and once mid fall sem, both times prompted by emails telling me that its time for a check in lol
and ive emailed her a couple times also
Adam is pretty cool from when I met him
Adam is good I have him
Wonder how they decide who gets who
prob random
Jennifer Sturm!!!!
I have a guy named steven sabo 🤔
i got gabriel cooper
any comments on him?
I got Maya fenty
I had her
Is she good?
i have cynthia kim
got melissa steinmetz
has anyone heard anything about rhonda moore?
i have steven sabo, heâ€™s only been at case for 11 months so not sure if anyone knows about him
I got brian matthews
I have Melissa. She's been amazing.

In general I think the 4 year advisors don't tend to do much academic advising but are great people to turn to for mental health support and general life advice
awesome ty
if anyone got Wesley Shaub, consider yourself lucky
Would you guys recommend using rate my professor before picking courses, or are the reviews pretty skewed?
i think its a fairly good source
especially reading some of the ratings retrospectively, they're hella accurate for some profs
shes nice
Right on, thanks.
yes but take everything with a grain of salt
Case kids are very vocal when it comes to complaining about very slight inconveniences
unless it's a recurring issue with every review, people like to complain about their pet peeves
especially take with a grain of salt ones that are mostly negative but have a handful of rlly positive reviews--check what class a given review is for/see if theres a pattern in what people talk abt
Shout-out Jeremy
Reading his rate my professor is a hilarious way to spend a couple hours because he replies to every rating
I love reading his rate my professor - there is this one completely convoluted and not understandable post and he responded with "thanks - I think?" and im like bro why are you responding to that
Rate my professor can be a good auxillary tool, especially to avoid particular professors. But there are certain criticisms that mean more than others. For example, "grades too harshly" is also a comment made by people who just didn't do well
It's usually better to ask people who have taken a class for their perspective
Okay but seriously what is this review and why did he respond to it
💀
i have no clue but i love it so
lmfao
He replies to everything lol
They are so funny tho
Awww thanks â¤ï¸
This is so cursed
But yeah Jeremy is a real one, I never took any philosophy classes but my SO was a philosophy major and enjoyed his class
There are no consequences
Every professor can see what you write on rmp, if that bothers you
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
I think it makes it a more helpful resource if the professor replies to the reviews
Ofc but it's like a restaurant owner responding to every Yelp review
I mean shore but imo it's a little weird to respond to *every* review
Yeah thats true, i mean he clearly went out of his way to do it too like he responded to a review from 2011 in 2023
Wait fr?
Bruv moment
Whoâ€™s like the really cool and younger MechE professor
He's a philosophy professor, I think he just believes in discourse and conversation lol

Lmao
I think it gives good insight into his teaching philosophy that he considers and replies to all the comments
Especially because rmp is the only forum for profs to really do that
They can't reply to course evals lol
Rate my professor was a thing in 2011
honestly im with him on this one
the mitchells challenge is very good
lets hope no ones comp enough to run it at 998
I predict multiple people will try to type one or both numbers
true

I thought the president and the dean were the same thing tbh
Deans are administrators at a lower level than the president
This might be the fastest response a college has ever given me yeesh
30 minutes later
This fucking doctor put my name as joseph
That is not my name😭
LMFAOOO
LMFAO
Well if they accept it they accept
"hey so we don't have your name down as Joseph"
I mean they do ask for ur preferred name so I don't think it'll matter too much
If anyone submitted their ID photo for approval, how long did it take for it to get approved?
around a day
pretty quick
2 for me
Oh ok cool. Thx
who would I call
actually nvm, I think I know👍

w h a t
only in ohio
Funniest part is Case fucking got it back💀
More or less a week for me
@_zacc thoughts on Lawrence "Lawrence Sears" Sears?
I was taking notes during one of his lectures and he asked me if I was watching porn
true story
Well, were you?
no
just circuits
which I mean for some people
also he has a statue of a dragon that breathes fire in his driveway
cool guy
paid for a lot of stuff
smart
The only lore I know are the Larry Lab horror stories I heard from '24 EE majors this past semester
was in the lab until 3am only 2-3 times
anyways all you class of 2028 kids should join CWRU motorsports if you like building stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXEzGaj0ipk
But like why Baja over CWRUbotix or rockets
i would say baja is the most intense design team. We built pretty much the whole car from scratch every year, a large chunk of the think[box] staff are on our team, and we are at least currently the most competitive team with other schools if that's your thing.
We stan baja
We send people to SpaceX, Tesla, Rivian, Apple, Formlabs, Rockwell Automation, and a bunch of other cool places
oh we have our own CNC machine too. her name is betsy. she's great
Whatâ€™s the time commitment?
we also teach you how to use a lot of the machine tools in think[box], and my team teaches PCB design and embedded systems development (think arduino but from scratch instead of using the arduino IDE and boards)

there
that's all the cool baja stuff you get for now lol
BA
I'm aiming for a BA in cs
planning to!
don't quote me but pretty sure that's 125
Do CWRUbotix, we have googly eyes
first 1/3 of 125 is probability, then it goes into calc 1 and 2
If youâ€™re good with probability take 125
they do have googly eyes
all the design teams for the most part are friends with each other though, and we generally help each other out when asked
whats the difference between ba and bs
Depends on major
mostly the kinds of classes you take
We'll use CS as an example
sure
CS BA: Calc I/II, 13 CS classes
CS BS: Calc I/II/III, linear algebra, 20 CS classes
yeah kinda
its the amount of STEM background you get imo
, security requirement, statistics requirement, etc etc etc
yeah basically stem requirement
also in the college of arts an sciences BAs are a lot easier to combine with other degrees
ohh i see
they used to but it got swapped for linalg
diffeq is technically a group 2 tech elective
yeah hello anyone in STEM ever please take diff eq and linear
And the good linear at that not the ... other one
201 suffices for cs
just take SOME linear
Not so
even a lot of the complicated modern control stuff in EE makes plenty of sense with 201
Physics majors
its useful for cs and physics but not necessary
I might be biased for "some reason" but yes
201 suffices
also have u looked into doing meche aero combined bc u can do that here if that interests you
The aero capstone 🗿
depends on the quantum you're doing
you can get all the way through schrodinger without actually understanding whats going on lol
yeah, its a difference of like three classes ao im down to do that
I only know one person at case who is doing an aero degree without the meche degree as well
I know one who's AE/Math, I think without MechE
he writes software for baja
What's his name
will mac
Ah I know a different one
lol who do you know?
Ben Rubinstein
he's rocket team
I have to specify because I think no exaggeration he is like the 10th Ben
Nice
will writes gpu accelerated rigid body physics engines for us
Tyler Griffith is doing aero no mech. 
But I think he is also doing physics
You guys have in-house *physics engines*?!
Do standard things not suffice?
Granted I have no idea what is industry standard
Or does it cost $$$
industry standard is software like ansys or comsol which we do also use
but this is a very particular problem
That's actually so cool
adam no more extracurriculars for you
hes only taking 37 classes thats light. he can join baja
How rigorous is that real analysis
So not rigorous
kind of hand wavey but we do a lot of series and fourier stuff in signals and systems
yes update head empty
If you really think about it, Fourier analysis is just linear algebra
spectral density of signals, transmission line theory, etc
most of EE just boils down to PDEs
PDEs my beloved
Linear PDEs I hope?
haha no
💀
do you at least approximate them with linear pdes
of course

she $$\del \cdot E $$ on my $$ = $$ till I $$\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
tragic
Classic physics/EE moment
Treating \del like an actual variable
I asked my 124 professor if it was an abuse of notation and he thought about it and said "no"
del dot E is the divergence of the electric field
Yeah
oh i see what u mean now
notational abuse
works well tho
it's just a symbol
who was that lol
sounds like covault
Covault
Yes
had him for e&m, was good but also e&m is physics that I just flat out cook in
Hm I wonder why
😔
ive heard many good things about covault cant wait for his class lol
at the very least an interesting prof
Howâ€™s Calc 3 and Diff Eq at case?
Those classes more than any depend on the prof
At least, in my experience
who did you have
Horn
yeah diff eq can either suuuuuck or be ez pz
i got gurarie'd for diff eq
i got roque-sol'd
I would make a joke about L'HÃ´pital but too soon
for what?
i did it for calc 3
Question, CCP credits do not transfer if they were used for HS graduation?
how was it
exactly like the practice tests i did
the chinese communist party?
loll
â€¦ college credit plus
💀
i know lmao
what practice tests did u do
https://casfaculty.case.edu/christopher-butler/math-223-test-reviews/
these
and some others i cannot recall
We have the test to like
itâ€™s so free
When it says we can have small pets in the dorms, does that include capturing a squirrel?
Doubtful
I've known a couple people who kept a hamster, not much else
We can have pets?
Yeah small pets
What about orphans
Galvanized steel!!!
screws from my aunt <3
and eco friendly wood veneers
wall mounted toilet to save space
I think the best low maintenance and code abiding pets you can have are ants or beetles
Like an ant farm or beetles in a small habitat
Or just bugs in general as long as theyâ€™re in a small terrarium
And Iâ€™m pretty sure small fish tanks are ok too but they have to be SMALL like for one or two goldfish max
did yall get the GradGuard insurance? Is it worth it?
Grad guard is low(high)key a scam
Oh ok, yeah I was kinda thinking that but just wanted to make sure. Ty!
Take everything I say with a grain of salt bc itâ€™s all based on personal experience, try to see if you can find anyone that bought it and ask them if itâ€™s worth it too
👍
tbh applecare pays for itself in about 2 to 3 years
just smash your phone beyond repair after 2-3 years and apple'll most likely just give you a new one
um acktuallie insurance is one of the best and safest investment strategies for if you have excess cash 🤓 â˜🏼
wait how is spending money on something investing i don't get the joke
best investment scheme is actually to convince people to invest in your company and then pay back your other investors with their money
life insurances
and as a way of keeping the value of money
There are life insurance policies that offer cash value accounts that you can pay into for a dividend if your insurer performs well
plus the set amount of your death benefit is guaranteed
life insurance is just 1 of many types
there's also annuities that's basically bonds but a lot less regulated/insured (ironic) than typical bonds (muni/gov) beecause it's a "bond" of the insurance company
Investing tip?
but the best part about this is that the dividends from these insurance investments are tax deferrable
for legal reasons these are not investment advices
Open a Roth IRA and put $500 every month
Youâ€™ll have 4.5M by the time you retire
btw kids Chase's 2 and 6 months CD rates are 4.25% rn
my crossbow is insured
but when i buy one, i'll be able to use my crossbow insurance
hey
Yeah I got sub 30
@alexis.eb California 👍
Southern California 👎
(I am from California but the non-southern part)
Only jokingly
Temporarily
But from what I know LA is very very stable in general so who knows
💀
yeah but i can get by with a hoodie because it's kind of always sunny enough
Ah right
Yeah please buy a coat especially because you'll be getting here in January
definitely planning on it
hitting up REI sometime soon
Such a real California experience right there
definitely
guilty as charged and all that
thats so good to hear because i don't think i'd survive
Then again I'm not from the coast so we get temperature swings here, so I'd ask another LA person
I will say living here my whole life, the past few winters have been so much milder than when i was younger
\:-(

bay area is moody
In what way
every way
So true
u can experience 40 and 90 on the same day
This is true
See I lived in Berkeley so we had a fun experience called Fog All Day During July
Can you bring the snow back please -a winter enjoyer
Yup that is the Berkeley experience
Adam is singlehandedly causing climate change for the fun of it
Alright I'll work on it for this winter
(You're welcome spring Alex)
(thank you thank you)
after the ghetto part of oakland
yk what i mean
wait that sounds fun
no not that
not the serious crimes part
east oakland
especially crime ridden
race cars i can deal with
It sounds like a good thing then
telegraph ave** esp
I am not familiar with these
This road goes through to Berkeley so this does make sense in a way
east bat
bay
Okay nice
Not South Bay
~~Good~~
but i go to oakland for orchestra
HA
south bay is poisoned im sry
attitude of ppl there is absolute 🤮
more street racing too
for anyone in engineering--I'm looking into computers.. is a core i9 necessary or will a 13th gen i7 do?
imo i9s are overkill for most scenarios... and their price point isn't worth the slight speed
For most schoolwork i7 will work great
thank you!!
npnp
oh awesome that's crazy helpful tysm 🙂
get an i7 and as much ram and storage as you can
GPU is imporant but not super important for CAD unless you're doing renders in keyshot or something
you should be fine with 16 gb ram and maybe 1 tb of storage from what ive read
ive heard that too :) thanks!
I'd go with 32 tbh
if you're doing big solidworks assemblies it's worth it
okay okay good to know
def planning on that haha

that's how it's going with the ammonium perchlorate rocket i was working on
yeah i heard that too when i visited and talked to one of the guys working on it

Who's this random guy on the front page 😭
https://web.archive.org/web/20020118161451/http://www.case.edu/
Found it!

Thank you for finding it. 
I find it's fairly interesting, just how much it has changed over the years
rollerbladed uphill for a half a mile
i might just get shin splints
I think I am permanently more prone to them now
:((
I have some great stretches for the shins now tho
ohhh
Great shin stretch: stand a bit back from a flat wall with both your hands on it and a stance sort of like you're going to lunge. Then lean forward and touch the leading knee to the wall
And by shin stretch, it's a calf stretch, because that's the muscle behind the shin anyway
Essential for HvZ
loved you in its always sunny in Philadelphia
Random question but has anyone whoâ€™s applied or applying to med school soon have an estimate of their hours in the 3 categories (clinical/research/volunteer ) or the average at case?
Lol thanks
not premed myself but I would wait until you get to campus to worry about stuff like this. you will be surprised with how quickly your plans might change
take the summer to relax you're about to go to college and get your ass handed to you
Anyway, I agree with zacc, don't try to plan out your entire future before you even get here. I would say a large amount of the people I know have changed their major or future plans since starting college
Including myself, a couple times
finding people that do exactly what they expected to do in college is so rare
~~like I expected to have waaaaaaaaay more time to drink~~
loll
i got a good recipe for jungle juice from my teacher lmfao
sage advice for you children as an old person, if you're going to drink alcohol make sure you can taste the alcohol, cover your drinks, and if you're going to do psychotropic drugs have a babysitter and make sure you can go outside and explore in a safe manner
Seconding that, and also count your drinks, never use liquor for drinking games (stick to beer, hard seltzer, etc.), always have a sober monitor, and avoid tub drinks (like jungle juice)
friend of mine brings a marker and tallys drinks on the back of his hand lol
hey so buddy how old are you?
lmao
Charlie is 25 years old! This is above the legal drinking age and as such ...
what if you did it legally ( im in europe alot)
I'm just saying like, this is a server on the CWRU portal, let's keep things not illegal
Talking about this stuff in theory is fine, and advice is helpful for anyone (for the future ofc)
Okay have fun 🥰
oh wait you said *no* illegal stuff?
Lol
Preferably yeah
Jokes are jokes, but let's keep things not concerning if the dean were to randomly join this server
But I know a lot of profs who do use discord
Juan Orendain
liquor before beer you're in the clear, don't do heroin
Lol
i'm confused are we suggesting people do heroin now?
No
jesus
yeah that's what i'm saying
Like if you've time travelled before painkillers existed and you're getting surgery
if you're time travelling heroin is probably the least of your concerns
fent is an option
morphine
Charlie: don't talk about underage drinking because that's illegal
28 server: Okay but what if we talked about fentanyl and heroin
yeah morphine is fine
Lol
The over the top ones are a bit funnier though
One time my friend said he was given ketamine to get his wisdom teeth out
that and propofol is what they used
I had propofol for a surgery two summers ago, and it was weird
I heard it made you euphoric but it just made me dizzy
i mean a decent amount of people have had fentanyl in a medical setting
for general anesthesia
its actually a possible cause for postop nausea
Make sure to pace yourself (BME premed...). You're already thinking ahead which is more than a few people. Volunteering is a way to broaden your perspective and see how the rest of society operates, and determining what place *you* will play in it. Don't hold back, and focus less on the hours (theyll definitely be completed) and more about actively trying to help other people because you value quality care regardless of your biases/emotions towards whoever youre helping (like what youll eventually be doing...)

@wanningswontons what actually happens in it
That's rad
:frogvibing:
my intent was to finish undergrad in three years and work as an intern at the NIH for a year
but this cs major is giving me hell :pandacry: especially considering the number of credits and the fact that none of the classes overlap with anything pre-med related *sobs*
If you're doing a BS in CS, you could drop down to a BA
nah ima get a BS, the NIH thing would've been the ideal case
"case" badump tss
The ideal **Case**
Lol jinx
HELP
I always planned on doing BA
this plus two high-level science courses w approval by the SOM
2 semesters of inorganic chemistry with lab
2 semesters of organic chemistry with lab
3 to 4 semesters of biology with lab
2 semesters of physics with lab
1 semester of biochemistry
2 semesters of English composition
1 to 2 semesters of quantitative coursework (calculus and/or statistics)
1 to 2 semesters of behavioral sciences

pre-med requirements for case
huh okay so it looks like the main difference is no calc req
Fewer maffs 😔
yeah but i am doing maffs for cs
YAY MATH!
:depression:
I mean, um, cool
bro the fact that i can just nab a free math minor just by doing cs is so goated
nope i think i got them all? lemme check
So Calc I/II/III, discrete, linear (assuming you take 307)
Nice!
> No more than two courses can be used to satisfy both minor requirements and the requirements of the studentâ€™s major field (meaning departmental degree requirements, including departmental technical electives and common course requirements of the studentâ€™s school)
Okay yeah that one extra'll do't
im doing 307 and 380 next semester and im good
HEHE
I think I got a laboratory-acquired infection

what does baker nord scholars mean
whatever
Some scholarships are named and the names don't mean anything, others have names that dictate some program requirements
i think baker nord is for humanities and you have a mandatory seminar thing with projects

Lol, congrats?
the guy was so dry
for the entirety of it
Pro tip
nursing majors
Yes?
have a great opportunity at CWRU because its ranked top 5 in the nation
. . .
How is it? Like in terms of competition, equipment, coaching? Also indoor or outdoor?
If I have my own bows can I bring them and store them?
I have a travel case for my equipment lol
Just is there a place at case to keep them or do I keep em in my dorm
I would plan to store your own stuff
YESSS INDOOR
Iâ€™m a hater of outdoor 😓
i learned outdoor but indoor is very nice. the ceiling is hilariously low though and there are a number of initialed little marks where people accidentally shot it
Haha real stuff tho
Glad they have storage I donâ€™t know if my roommate would have loved both my recurves hanging out in our room 😭
lmfao yeah. there were talks of the university doing rennovation on our normal range, so we might change location at some point (?) I'm not really sure the details on that, but I'd reach out to exec if you want details
Tbh as long as I can keep shooting Iâ€™m happy

i found someone off discord, def made the dorming experience way better
Yeah I guess I just
Thought it would be awkward tbh 😭
But also
I do plan on doing GIH so I guess I should wait and see
If I get into that first
Cause you're locked into a specific set of dorms in that case iirc
true
I'm gonna be
In Germany when the housing app opens
💀
It opens on the 13th right
Think so yeah
It's gonna be 1 am in Germany at the time so
Probably doing it the next day
Thatâ€™s rough bro
Wo in Deutschland wirst du sein
Dachau and Munich
We're going to the concentration camp memorial in Dachau and then heading to Munich after
Nice
Germany is cool
And they have more sunlight in the summer
adam is a plant
This just in: is the owner of the CWRU 2028 a filthy *liberal* from the state of California???
truly a **case** western reserve university conspiracy theory
Hearing cwru be called "crew" will always throw me off
I keep confusing my parents by calling it crew itâ€™s so fun
cwroo
This webinar lady just said "shameless plug"
They just said we might have to put
It's precalc there's no way 😭
I had a random roommate and had a better experience than many of my friends who chose one, but a lot of it is down to luck I think
hoping to get one 🙏
Yeah, I was planning to message people about those later in the summer
I have a list of people and you are on it
bless brother
i always say "see doubleyou are you" or "case"
in one webinar i was in, the presenter kept swapping between the different pronunciations of the acronym
u got room for one more?
lowk real
I have my own mini fridge
🙏
And microwave
For that matter
lucky u
And she was just like
"yeah keep this for when you actually go to college"
dude your floor is gonna have a microwave
I've always been queesy about making food in front of other people
😭
I guess we'll see when housing stuff opens
gl

@retr0r0cket ANOTHER NORCALIAN
anyone do the writing seminar thingy
I should get around to that
i have no clue
Yeah
Nah
Atleast I'm gonna actually SEE this building
So only your seminar teacher sees it
stop naming things after tinkham veale  😭😭😭
Just wait for whatever new project they start in your sophomore year that plagues your morning hours for the rest of your time here that you'll never see completed
Case loves starting new construction projects lol
Almost as much as they love raising tuition
they could use that 20 mill to give me an extra 3k and follow up on their meet full need promise
:sideeye:
Might not help freshman year
But I know a lot of people who got a junior senior scholarship from them (including myself)
Caa?
Case alumni association
ohh
I might not even qualify for that tbh
Cs qualifies lol
I figured but it also specifically mentions a BS in engineering or the applied sciences
Where does it do this?
https://i.imgur.com/qmHs8Kl.png
Before I become accidentally ineligible
at least its not another mather
true
like do i have a decent chance if i apply or is it super competitive
I got it so I'm guessing the former
i mean maybe they have  a lot of funds to go around
where are they even putting the iseb
Yost
😔
> will serve as the universityâ€™s central connector from Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to Case Quad.
this is bizzare then bc there is fully a row of buildings there already but okay
What do you mean? The weird back entrances are great! That area is always quiet because no one uses it.
💀
Okay okay itâ€™s probably not the end of the world
You can email them and reschedule

Hopefully you have someone understanding but if not all they can do is be salty about it
I made it to the meeting just super late so we rescheduled for tmtw
Tmrw
Ngl
I got lucky

Mhm
You know it
Where u from ~~in this place where you order a burrito for less than $15~~
Davis
Nice
First time Iâ€™ve met somebody actually from Davis instead of them going to UC Davis
So real
No
I'm probably gonna try and do it tonight
i keep forgetting
thanks
so real
Is there any decent Mexican food on/near campus?
There is chipotle on campus which does not count to me
Real
It's more like a hipster gastropub version of a Mexican restaurant
What about asian food?
And indian Flame as indian
Some people like kenko, I think it's alright
Build the pho continues to disappoint me, but if you're willing to trek a little bit on the bus pho and rice in Coventry is great
Chopstix and otani are cheap, but not great imo
There's also an Asian bakery in Coventry that has good pastries and boba imo
But it does exist
It's called Koko iirc
As someone who loves food
That case cash is probably not getting refunded to me
Ngl
At Clemson the lines to get into the dining halls were abhorrently long but Clemson also has 20k undergrads so
Ah, maybe I should try that one next semester
Itâ€™s goood
In Coventry
Then again I'm from Las Vegas which has higher Mexican and Asian populations, so I have high standards
Lol yeah I definitely use mine for food
Me to my bf: I'll treat you as long as they take case cash
😭
I am not trying to criticize your enjoyment of Mexican food lol
I am just saying that I personally have high standards
Why are you responding to this message 😭
The answer is no
So hopefully
But there is *passable* Mexican food
I am good with food
You'll be fine
Eg. Lactose intolerance, acid reflux
Freshman year I spent my entire second semester eating like 10 Dunkin grilled cheese sandwiches a week
Clemson was so weird the week I was there
Like they had rly good food the first day
And then completely abandoned it the rest of the week
But like through touring/visiting my siblings college/and performing at colleges through my hs music program I have eaten at a decent number of colleges (at least 5 I think) and the only one that has been better than case is umass Amherst which was voted to have the best food on a college campus period (though thatâ€™s more of a reflection of the other colleges than case)
I've only eaten at uhh
3? Colleges
Claflin was by far the most questionable
This is what happens for o-week and then the rest of the semester lol
Wires crossed idek what I'm saying
It wasn't even like it was something special
It was just this one part that made a good burger
I meant to say that case dining halls are edible, but not gourmet
But they switched from that to like veggie burgers the rest of the week randomly
😭
It's not like I'll be making a lot of money anyway
Maybe I'll save for a car or something
I make like 12 an hour at mine
Mostly because I am so busy and the available shifts tend to conflict with other responsibilities
But yeah I mostly spend money on food lol
I have a Greek meal plan + some case cash that I use to eat around campus
for the out of sequence Organic chemistry course ^^^
Maybe Joel or Sam might see this
You can @ them assuming itâ€™s a reasonable hour at some poiÅ„t
Yes so at a reasonable hour
got it thx, hru Adam
Also, Ohio â˜ ï¸
Chilling
How are you Garlic Noodles
Not all at Case live in Ohio
(Charlie is the sole exception)
lmao

😭
a lot
it's gonna be an expensive boi
The original quote was $300 million, I think their goal is to fund at least half of that with donations, they might already be there. A lot of people have already donated
But also with how these things go I wouldn't be surprised if they overrun the cost

The bank I use has a location close to case
🙏🙏
Thankfully don't have to worry about switching
Youâ€™re a vet?
No its not just for vets
It's invitational too
My mom got it from military family iirc and I got it from my mom
Open an account at Chase
Get a HYSA with way better rates
Ez 💰
W nepotism
Switching banks was always very inconvenient
So
Did anyone do the writing seminar?
I am currently
Halfway done
I did the summarizing portion and now have to do the my take on it portion
Do we have to like use other resources and include citations?
Or is just a normal essay
Just to use the source we are reading off of
The only thing confusing me is the word count
They said approximately 500 so im assuming a little above 500 is fine
Yeah I think mine was about 510ish words
https://i.imgur.com/uC2Rks4.png
war is over
And they keep adding stuff so thats not helping either
And technically I'm not even done
Cus I have the actual housing app later
just submitted my seminar 😎
i went for around 450 wordsâ€¦.
Thats
Unfortunate
Yeesh
Case has their own housing issues but at least they guarantee housing for freshmen and sophomores
They used to guarantee housing for all four years, but then they accepted so many freshmen that it became impossible
where did upperclassmen used to live?
Stj, the village, hazel, and triangle I think used to be all upperclassmen
Id probably only join if there was a financial incentive to do so
But the problem is that even with the same number of housing seats, there are just more upperclassmen now than there have ever been as class sizes grow larger
I'm getting
So yeah it would be rly inconvenient to live off campus
A lot of upperclassmen decide they do not want to live on campus, which means those who do have better odds
But yeah since I get so much financial aid from case it's better to live on campus than to go out of pocket for housing, even if it's cheaper on paper
And I save more money on the Greek meal plan than I pay for dues, so it works out
The meal plan they make all the freshmen choose from is such a scam imo
You are paying like $17 a meal assuming you eat every single meal at the dining hall for the unlimited plan
I chose unlimited
Seemed like a better deal than the other ones so
Unlimited is technically a better deal than 17 but it's still a scam
really okay
Part of the motivation of the new dorms is to get all the sophs on south side I think
yeah
i heard they want to move everyone off top of the hill eventually?
Lol sure they want to in theory
But I wouldn't worry about it happening during any of our times at Case
Or accept hundreds fewer students a year
If I'm wrong about this y'all can laugh at me in 3 years ig
A lot of people live top of the hill
Probably at least 1000 people
Where tf else are they going to put us
Case would also have to contend with all the Greek life that lives on top of the hill
yeah
i mean they kicked two sororities off but they werenâ€™t meeting quota so there was reason to ig
Was it tri sigma? I heard some rumors
Yeah if you don't meet occupancy they do have grounds to evict you lol
Tri sig is in the village now yeah
Just a big house to fill
if you eat 3 or more meals a day and/or drink coffee in morning, u basically have to
Hot chocolate>
honestly big respect for zero caffeine
real
Could not be me but yeah you save yourself the inevitable cardiac event scare
we are one in the same
😭 imagine caffeine having any effect on you lol
Crazy
Iâ€™m sorry but also glad for you?
i get effected a lil bit for a couple hours
and then it goes the opposite direction
YESS
i literally cannot girl i have adhd
WHAT
:DD
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
i mean at least
YES
I'm just built different ig?
is alcohol the way to go!? who knows
*indestructible*
hot chocolate is good only at a certain temp lol
imo
too hot it burns my tongue
iâ€™d stick to matcha always if i could
but that shit is so expensive hello 😭
I have hot chocolate trauma story
|| little me (4?) had it for the first time and did realize it would be hot so Iâ€™m handed this thing and I immediately chug it before realizing it was scalding and then preceded to spew it out into the park grass at six years old ||
😭 that's tragic
Yes but incredibly funny for my parents
During covid I would just make hot chocolate all the time and once I spilled it on my table (no electronics were harmed thankfully)
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ no one has a consistent memory
Yep
One day at 8 I just gained consciousness so
So real but I was a late bloomer because I know it was at 10 for me
Before that is it just the most random glimpses of memories
Akshskdbs I have the vaguest memory of being in pre k but its in black and white
That is so interesting
Idk I'm just special like that
For sure, Iâ€™ve heard weirder
I was conscious as a child lol
I have memories from pretty young ages. Not complete ones, but existing ones
Thatâ€™s so cool
i dont remember living in germany but remember stuff once i moved to the us decently well so i guess i was like 4 when i gained consciousness?
But maybe disturbing
You lived in Germany? Thatâ€™s cool
moved when i was almost 4 so like i dont remember it but yeah
i gained consciousness around 3
today i learned its possible to not remember all the way back to 3 years old?
Ig so
Real
yeah for sure! dad grew up there and we still have family there

even if you withdraw with a passing grade?
yep
WE HAVE WHAT
Y'all are choosing classes
What
? how
Maybe cause of the credit evaluation stuff
oh right the sis thingy
i saw'=
😭
real
i still have to meet with my advisor
Wbat
How did they take
i got a little too curious
this
it depends on what (and where!) the classes are
does the school add the seminar automatically or do you manually do it
yeah thats a later process
also not everyone takes aiqs in the fall, but im not sure if theyve released that yet
im pre nursing
My advisor was telling me about that
It just shows up
According to my advisor
i mean theres a form that yall fill out over the summer if youre in a fall aiqs or later on if youre in spring
so you do play a part in the process but its separate from regular course registration
Are there specific times for aiqs?
you pick them after regular classes, so youâ€™ll be given a list of every aiqs being offered that doesnâ€™t conflict with your current schedule. itâ€™ll have class titles, descriptions, and times. youâ€™ll pick up to four that you like, and youâ€™re assigned one of those
yeah i had 3 back to back to back classes with 15 min in between on mon wed fri my first semester
depending on your course selection and # of credits its to be expected
is there any way to work around it or do i just have to bear with it for the first semester?
did you also have a breadth?
yeah i did JAPN 101
my schedule for next semester has 15 minute gaps again, 1) for the sake of taking certain courses and 2) to spread out my lectures throughout week a little more evenly
4 classes in 1 day is insane
This is my schedule next semester
?????? u are chilling
what the
Bing chilling
Key is front loading and summer/winter classes, cross lists and overlaps
what website is this?
that is the old schedule generator from last year's SIS
you should use stellic, which you can access on SIS
Old schedule generator format was goated but the new one has so many nice features
dope
its just a sample plan which you can reference to see which classes people tend to take at which points of college, you dont have to follow it exactly
awesome
with that said
your first year is the best time to try piling up more credits
what does that entail for the later years
do they count even after you drop them
true
nah freshman forgiveness lets you drop classes while not making a dent on transcript
thats nice
I freshman forgave chem105 and changed my major ty Drew
maybe german?
i've heard good things about german
what about italian or japanese?
language classes are small so you get more attention from the instructor which is nice
that is nice
loved japn 101, doing 102 over summer and 201 next semester
i had lai jiang she is amazing
ill take your word for it
and if you learn how to study efficiently (throw all your vocab into anki lol) its a free A
japn 101 is 4 credits though and its quite a bit of HW just letting you know
dang it, theres no times that fit the schedule
if there are other math 121 sections or chem111 sections you can switch things around to see if stuff fits
if not, not the end of the world
theres plenty of options around
or you could just roll with 14 credits
from 9;30 - 10;35 and 10;35 - 11;25 respectively
with tuesday being two labs i think
ik bruh
yeah
yeah..
some bs
maybe its too early to start
Wait a second
oh did you actually think I was art history
😂
yeah i thought so this whole time LOL
lmfaooooo
😭
tbh any art student would just go to CIA
Oh so now you're Oscar (no class on Fridays '25)
😂
yes:Giga_Chad:
yeah Case isn't exactly known for its social studies programs...
and the only class that works is filled
but we do have a surprising amount of poli sci students
I was taking 100 level classes my second semester sophomore year
I'm pretty sure
lemme check
kk
yep I took EEPS121
adojo the goat
Whatâ€™s your current schedule looking like
aside from taking the course another time, you could also
1) spy on the section periodically to see if someone dropped it (i did this at least once a day)
2) submit an overflow request
now I control half of the banking and finance department :pepedevil:
â€œControlâ€
i had to go to 33% zoom to see this
wait we have to choose classes today
So this is 3 classes so far?
No way
Itâ€™s usually in July
I think just for ap credits or something
Dw itâ€™s not the main course selection Iâ€™m 99% sure
oh thank god wait don't ap scores come out on july 8th
ohh okay
yes
wait kevin are you enrolling yourself or just looking at available classes?
in the column of options in that section of SIS, go to the bottom where it says something like schedule planner to access stellic which is the vastly superior planner/display
ah alr gl with that
yea thanks
okk
You can also test out
its beautiful
my roommate was complaining about that lmaooo
but christopher butler is a goated instructor
@tazmania40 somehow had credit for Calc 1 and 3 at one point but not Calc 2 so you could ask them
very worth
Interesting
No
Okay
How many classes are you thinking of taking your 1th semester
5, maybe 6
Depends on how many of my calc credits transfer honestly
Because youâ€™re also math and CS I have some recommendations for 1st semester scheduling stuff
Would love to hear them
Cool, Iâ€™ll DM you
hot take
it's when the campus is the most peaceful
REALLLL
thoughts?
like when its snowing, or when its spring and sunny and the flowers are blooming in the trees
would they even allow 7 classes
... this is 4 classes
oops
lmao 7 is crazy
I'm blind 😂
I would honestly recommend taking 5 classes. While there is something to be said for taking it easy as a first semester freshman, imo 5 is not too unmanageable and as a freshman you have the ability to drop one whenever you need to
Taking 5 classes a semester will make your schedule significantly more flexible than only 4, and now you have the opportunity to find out whether that works for you the easy way rather than the hard way
Nawwww last semester was fun
Yes
yes
Oh so ig sages and general education requirements are the same thing as breadth stuff right
what kind of transfer credit is it?
pro tip: some breadth classes can count as breadth AND minor/secondary major required classes
4+3+4+4=15
you can do 2 more
max 19
lets see what i can
do
problem is the lack of classes
I have credit from cleveland state for calc 1-3
All the way through Calc III?!
wait since when I thought it was 21 and then 22+ you need a 3.5+ GPA for advisor permission
lucky
Then please placement test out
i was a little crazy with my hs schedule
same
ohhh ok
afterwards you can take...up to 23?
do 24 credits second semester then :PES_Devil:
Only 24?
did you take it at CSU?
😭
if so then you're probably good
I did
yeah you're probably good
Should i wait for case to get back to me about the transfer credit first or just email him now?
I would say email now to ask what to do in case XYZ happens, because then you can plan better
And if you have Calc I/II/III credit then your math options for next semester become a lot more fun 😈
anyone had Kosuke Ogaki? shes available i believe for japn 101
I think it would be hilarious to take math 321 first semester and if i can i might just because itd be funny
Going roughly from more sane to less sane
real would have been nice to do
does it substitute the original website, or do i have to add the courses on it again?
Im just prepared for them to only give me credit for calc 3 but not 1 or 2 because of the 80% match policy
Tyler how did you resolve the Calc II Incident
i have heard good things about him, he also came into my 101 class to talk about 102 options. i have basically seen him for 5 minutes but he is the funniest and most engaging mf on the planet
hes doing my 102 summer course
alright then im set!
Bruh what
when you aren't registered for the courses, you have to add them to plan in stellic (it does not look at shopping cart)
he then said he was gonna give me the guy's name who I need to contact and promptly did not
A withdrawal at cwru does not count towards your gpa
ogaki sensei is awesome! i had him for 201 this past semester
Thank god
This is the normal amount of time between classes
onitsuka sensei is also super slay, the japanese department as a whole is epic
Why do you expect us to write a 10 page paper in a 100 course
RELAX
Some people think you should take a bunch of credits first semester, I personally disagree
would it be manageable to have all stem stuff, or would you recommend a class not related to my major at all
for ex instead of japn101 i could take ecse132 instead
smth like this
It depends on how much you like taking stem classes all the time
different classes
engr vs ecse
engr is engineering and ecse is coding in java
Gonna schedule most of my stuff for the morning
The only time I've ever woken up past 10 is when I went to bed at 2 the previous night
I woke up at 6:30 every day and having an 8am wouldâ€™ve obliterated me
I don't see why not spend that time actually doing something
I am so glad that
them's rookie numbers try 4 am
Throughout highschool I typically woke up at 5:50 ish to catch the bus
Since it came at 6;30
my tour guide was art history lol
They are different types of intro coding classes, but my impression is that no one really has to take both of them
It is different when you need to take care of yourself and do everything
Too eepy :(
when there's no people around case campus be nice frfr
:X2doubt:
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Godspeed  Mon Ami
oh yeah you'll be chillin
Sheesh
😭
I think the main difference in my routine
Would probably have to be actually eating before I get to class
Id have to make time to go to a dining hall before my classes I guess
you can also get a ticket for takeout at dining hall and eat your food in lecture
I figured eating in a lecture would be banned
nah 4/5 of my professors did not care
shes so funny bro
*[this statement was redacted]*
whats the first rule
I remember hearing about Berkely having a furry club or something
Which was hilarious to think about
LMFAOOO
loll
shes just like me fr i love her
So ig yeah take 130 and 132
Okay yeah it's a new requirement so I'm not that goofy 😭
What a strange thing to do
join greek life fr
^
i cant wait to
what frat are yall in
I'm in Theta Chi
:OX:
how is it
I've heard their president is really cool and handsome
I quite like it
@flaminshock what frat are you in
https://tenor.com/view/kwajiune3kothe3chu-gif-9908025856657732954
(I will elaborate more later but busy rn)
fraternity
I'm in ligma sigma sigma
Greek life is really cool at case and the community is quite welcoming. Best part is there is something for everyone in Greek Life. Though Theta Chi is the coolest, no bias whatsoever
yea greek life is pretty chill here. I'm not a member but lots of my friends are or were in frats and sororities
CWRU academics are no joke
I'm pretty sure the magna cum laude GPA is 3.9
i was thinking of doing that
but
its a lot
A life lesson: itâ€™s better to do a few things well than many things midly
true
did you intern over your freshman summer?
No, I worked as a teaching assistant at an academic camp
Why ask thou
Then get research at Case
Thatâ€™s much easier
wdym research?
like projects?
Professors at Case do research
unless you're a genius made in a lab like me that can do many things well
(I freshman forgave chem105)
Or nepotism
or nepotism
and somehow that worked
this is 24
Please do not do this
Not your first semester
lmfaoo
okay
ditch acct 100 and econ 102
also why java and 130?
I interned
but that's super uncommon

but i guess i can change that actually
java is kind of free tbh
yk
you can also take classes jsut bc they sound interesting
nepotism is the #1  way to getting a good career
5 minutes later a whole SWAT team's gonna show up at my apartment asking me how I got his number
281
Max is 19
also @_cody17_ you are an EE you will *need* to touch grass in college lol
ask me how I know
join baja, talk to girls (or boys or enbys) go to parties
you will dude
im planning on doing that
EE major is probably the most painful at case engineering
oh god
join baja we will craft you into a deadly EE
absolute weapon
cant wait for it
hell ya
If you've never been depressed before this is how you start
Is Baja good for ME majors
Oscar is phi psi iirc, and then there are some theta chi people as well as some delta upsilon people here (including myself)
I know people of quite a few other Greek orgs tho, most (but not all) have a good experience
if theres any girls in chat, i have a couple friends in sigma sigma sigma and they really like it
the best
smh it's tri sigma
im well aware but im spelling things out for the youngins
Î£Î£Î£
baja is nice because you get to do the absolute craziest engineering of any of the design teams with regard to materials and complexity
like rocket team does cool stuff, robotics does cool stuff, but baja does multi axis cnc programming and metal 3d printing
Can confirm
hey 28s
Hi
have yall signed up for classes already
course registration opens july 16 for yall
If any of y'all are interested in environmental science, consider taking geology (eeps 110) it'll be fun (and also I'm taking it)
None of the other courses I'm taking besides glee club are particularly freshman friendly lol
oh good 😭
Yes speaking of Glee Club
If you're a low voice (or* even if you're not) please come join! It's so much fun
Also no audition
I am not good enough for an audition group, hence, I don't lol
I can second this - I am very much not a low voice and am a part of glee club and it is amaaaazing
how does greek housing compare to normal
Usually cheaper
thats good
Mine is a similar cost to a comparable single in university housing, but the meal plan is almost 2k cheaper every semester
Nic and ...
or am i trippin
Ryan?

Kyle and who
cooper or am i dumb
YOU'RE RIGHT!!!
that actually sounds dope, you need to be a second year to join? or are there other requirements
I would say most Greek life orgs have a "typical member" and then lots of people who are not typical
You can rush a fraternity in your first semester but cannot rush a sorority until your first spring
There are no restrictions on when you can join
I rushed 2nd semester
Fraternities have rush every semester, while sororities have formal recruitment in the spring and a more complicated answer to who can rush and when lol
i can vouch for the usefulness of getting established in college before rushing a fraternity and making the committment to a greek org
it has worked well for people i know
so first get situated in college and then join?
Yeah my chapter has people who joined anytime from first semester freshman to first semester junior, people can rush in junior or senior year, but usually if you're going to rush then you already have by that point
its mainly that you shouldn't use a greek org as a substitute for making friends and other connections on campus
I was happy to rush in my first semester, but I know other people who are glad they didn't join Greek life until sophomore year
and especially because going to college can cause you to change and realize a lot about yourself which may affect your desire to do a lot of things
Yeah, I would personally recommend not letting any one thing just be your life on campus
Yeah lol, rush is also three weeks long at case
For fraternities
If anyone wants me to try to explain the sorority layout I can try, but it's way more complicated lmao
i "rushed" second semester (went to board game night)
The process is like three weeks of rush, then a day where fraternities give out bids if they'd like you to join, a day of silence where they don't contact you, and then the first day you're allowed to return a bid. Different chapters have different things that come after that though
A lot have a big bid return event, some don't. Then there's differing policies on things like associate member education or pledge education or whatever that bridge the gap between accepting a bid and making the full commitment
Accidental information overload as all the random Greek life members start yapping 😭
lmfaoo i appreciate the information
college sounds like a blast
It is what you make of it in a lot of ways, but I personally do have a good time
But yeah, lots of opportunities exist, it's a matter of taking advantage of them
Greek Life on Case has really been on the up since Covid and everyone who is '28 should be excited to see what Greek Life has to offer whether you decide to join or not.
The best part of Greek Life on Case is it's not some secret society that secludes itself from the rest of the community like at some Universities or even Case at times, rather it is aiming to benefit and reach everyone.
Wait is that THE DU Tyler?
yes, I am a DU
and yes I am the Tyler you're referring to
2nding this, do not throw all your eggs into one basket, have a main friend group sure but its useful to be friends with people outside of that
I made basically no friends in my classes so it's also entirely possible to meet people through clubs, friends of friends, or happenstance
Also true, there's many ways to meet people
this is why our discord servers exist 💯💯
a lot of the intro classes are really big though. they get smaller as you get father along into your major
though idrk much about nursing so maybe classes are smaller at the start for you
Yeah kinda a universe of its own
Well no matter the situation of course I will just *win* people over with my *incredibly charming* personality and sense of humor
(I am myself am a space case)
lol youâ€™ll do great
Thanks at least the people Iâ€™ve met through happenstance and this discord seem chill
Also second this, thereâ€™s a pretty diverse set of fraternities and sororities at Case, it may not be everyoneâ€™s thing but I personally have really enjoyed my Greek experience
With the new prices we are now the cheapest second-year university housing available (even including the new doubles)
Also, I'll be honest. I'm quite a strange person, but I've had surprisingly little difficulty making friends at Case. Genuinely some of the most accepting people I've known
me at the end of the semester telling people "i see you every time in my cs lecture but i have no idea who u are"
Lmao, if I see someone enough I usually try to introduce myself
As a second semester sophomore my class sizes were:
200, 80, 25, 40, 20, 20, 20
All ballparks
First one was a big CS class
So you can see there are occasionally big classes but most of them are small
My largest class was complex analysis lol
Was the analysis complex?
really i found it quite simple (i did not take the class)
another was like 12
mobile robotics
path planning, perception and localization stuff
wow
was super interesting
I thought they cancelled classes with fewer than 5 students
Not this one
Yes 😭😭😭😭
Complex analysis is very cool as a subject and I definitely had fun at times, but the course material was pretty unforgiving
Professor Langer is a nice guy and a good lecturer, but he doesn't do any of the "lenient professor" stuff
No notes to take into exams, no formula sheets, no extra credit, no dropped scores, and absolutely no curve
Also thoughts on the Calc 3 professors? Like who I should have
Or at least something similar (singer has an interesting method)
https://discord.com/channels/1198835515911327934/1198836016899969094/1249885911135817768
Here's my thoughts on those three professors at least
224 is Calc 3?
Nah, DiffEq
I was just specifying how I know each professor
Lmao
I took calc 3 with Tran and he was a real one
Charlie is so dedicated to answering freshman questions
This is why we made him a mod 🫡
On god
Lmao, answering questions gives me purpose
Otherwise why am I here 😭
You're a mod, so warning people for trivial reasons, power abuse, banning whoever you like, ...
All the classic Discord/Reddit/chronically online mod things
Lol
Y'all wouldn't like me if I was evil 😈
I could be ur angle or your weevil
Our 📐 or our 🐛 you say?

i took calc 3 with tran and hated it so ymmv
Huh, I really liked Tran
he was super nice and very patient in office hours, but his explanations just made no sense
Tbf I think they've been trying to force everyone into the flipped classroom style, so maybe that's why
Ah yeah, that's a bit rough
Hopefully Sell will be back next semester
But who knows
I found Tran's explanations to be pretty good in calc 3, but I'm also somewhat intuitive with a lot of math topics, so some people may struggle more than I have
I would have done it if they had asked me \>:(
Literally 2024
lagrange what :mochisipy: 
i did not absorb any info from that entire section
I loved Tran - had him for calc 3
tran >>>
hey sam did biochem used to have tougher requirements like more calculus and physical chemistry too?

Room selection time slots are out
whatâ€¦
i got june 27
I got uh the 25th so not much better *but* my roommate did get the 18th so?
weird
win win
It's wild how spread out the dates are
big w rn
I mean does it even matter if its a late date??
hopefully?
â€œRooms from each Residential Community will be available during each room selection day.  We have a very limited number of single rooms which will be available to choose during each room selection dayâ€
I thought the rooms would come out in batches for each room selection date
Hm good point
i think that is what it's saying? like they'll have a bunch of rooms from each community reserved for each date so it's not that big of a deal if you get a later date
i hope so bc i got the last date lol
Yep that was what i was thinking of
Wishing you all best of luck in the hunger games.
You too 🫡
Thanks but I'm not participating lmao
Ah got it mb
You're good boss 😎
I got 7 pm June 20th
course and room selection in india bouta be wild

Raaaaa
lucky!
What can I say
Iâ€™m a real lucky duck
pick a single
trust
Nah I gotta room first year at least
wait is it just random for everyone?
woah, thats super early
worth or naw?
My experience having a roommate was totally fine
so singles are for sure better?
Some people say it's good for making friends, that's debatable
Having a roommate with BO is not an unfixable personality trait of theirs, and this is why you have RAs
like to a point
Maybe they should learn how to shower 💀
But hygiene is important
Sounds like my type of job
You can drink in the dorms?
Right on
had my meeting, my counselor is so nice
Thatâ€™s good
counselors are generally pretty nice, but they be slow ash when the semester starts bc hella ppl have questions
yeah, mine said to send emails with questions as they come up
Whoâ€™s your advisor
rose begalla
very sweet
u?
Jennifer Sturm
cool cool
u have ur meeting yet?
What exactly did you even do in the meeting?
@ 2:30
just talked about our schedules, like many credits they reccomend (15) and what classes you should take based on your major
have fun
15? Nah gotta max it out, all in
Not everyone is you Alex
go big or go home
i love blasting songs with heavy bass in the car
so real
You will do it to yourself again
Doubt
Sharing is caring (the bass with the cars around you)
there should be a car meet up, where they all blast music in sync
thatd be so cool
New business idea
or at the gym lmao
Truee
@rach6363 is doing it in 6, but that counts a summer term with 3 classes so more like 7
Jeez
Im doing both as a BS, but 5 semesters to get a BA in both sounds insane
Bro i just decided to look at the cs baâ€™s requirements and theres so many fewer courses
wait adam are you dual degree or is one of your majors a secondary major
Dual
jeez
Actually yeah thats a question, what exactly is the difference in requirements for double major and dual degree? Website isnt much help
CS is through Case School of Engineering so different geneds
There are geneds (and I donâ€™t mean like physics or Chem classes, I mean like the social science and global and cultural diversity stuff) for the different schools
So the options are dual degree (you have to do the gened requirements from both but you are literally given two diplomas) and secondary major (you only have to do the requirements from one but you get one diploma and one major is â€œsecondaryâ€ on there)
oh i guess itâ€™s a new thing with uger thatâ€™s itâ€™s all the same
Yeah i was going to say shouldnâ€™t it all be the same geneds now with uger
Added to my list of questions for when i meet my advisor
hi its me
***2 classes
i can yap to anyone who has qs on that
122, 310, 393?
no just 310 and 393!
So when did you take 122
placement test
🤓
Yeah I remember you telling me "well I need some class which counts for both math and CS ..." whereas I see funny class I take funny class
The main problem you would run into in 5 semesters is chains of classes, classes offered every 4 semesters, and meeting the 120 requirements. Unless you have a load of ap and other credits ofc
That's true
are there specific pre law or pre med discords or club discords that are relatively active
dont know but i find it funny how at case i know a million premeds but like 1 prelaw
There are professional fraternities for both of them
I believe it's phi delta epsilon for premed and phi alpha delta for prelaw
Found on Instagram as @casephide and @padcwru
Professional fraternities are somewhere between clubs, honor societies, and social fraternities. Mostly the dues and networking aspects of social fraternities, not really the structure
I also don't know if they have a discord, but you could ask on their Instagram pages

sherman 4th
Thx
Hbu?
Oh ya my dorm selection is on the 18th
Youâ€™re not at a disadvantage which is good
Just lock in
Practicing my finger game rn
No way you should see the Eiffel Tower!!
🧍🏻â€â™€ï¸
cannot tell if u joking or not

Nah I know Eiffel Tower is Greece
is anyone in pi kappa phi?

ill do that
might as well just couch hop atp
Uh what?
whatt
https://observer.case.edu/the-death-of-a-cwru-fraternity/
Oh I read phi kap
Too many phis and pis and kappas lmao
I was thinking about phi kappa theta in my mind 😭
I think they were down to 5 people at the end? With basically zero recruitment numbers
Fr
Covid was rough on a lot of Greek orgs
unfortunate
weâ€™ll be neighbors
me and @_distressed
What room?
anyone ever have a snoring roommate?
concerned about this too
noise cancellation headphones
Fall asleep first 👍
210
Weâ€™re 219
Earplugs
I highly recommended them for anyone who is noise sensitive when sleeping like myself, they help a ton
are people who are in the later timeslots at a disadvantage for dorm selection?
In theory no because there should be comparable available rooms for each slot
But who knows
I see 😭
It'll probably be about even
They're probably doing this to avoid the stress to their servers where they basically ddos themselves
oof okay that makes sense
hoping my roommate clutches up on the 20th
wait what if my roommate alr confirmed
Because theyâ€™re like the group leader so you would have to try for a new dorm and leave their group
I think my roommate chose me as a roommate when he did it so i was locked in to that room
Donâ€™t forget your headphones!
thanks, in my pocket
Thatâ€™s a solid room. Right next to the common space tho so depending on how your floor is it might get Loud from time to time (Tharun and I were in 218)
oh wait really?
is sherman 409 good
Welcome to Case
tyler pisser has evolved
for my yeat it was the tyler puker
BUT, @mykokorobrokoro any thoughts as a former Sherman resident?
oo i think 409 is a corner room!
sherman was pretty chill, we were the only girl floor
but chances are your ra will probs be better lol
Our RA did 0 events the entire year 😭
she made pancakes one night and we did a game night for like. an hour because the guys were hovering over us trying to force us out to watch football
Bruh 🤦â€â™‚ï¸
I also barely ever saw my RA
The common room of Raymond was full of football bros 24/7
I REMEMBER THIS INCIDENT
what do you guys think the best freshman dorm is
Depends -- in my time it was Cutler, but it sounds like Juniper (Taft, Taplin, Cutter, and Smith) were the best this past year
Cutler was the best in 2022 mainly for the people who lived there
So the dorms are actually pretty similar so like wherever u end up will be great - I was in taplin and I really liked it (juniper does have better kitchens and slightly bigger dorm rooms) but a big reason I liked was like Adam said - I really liked the people who lived there
football like football or america football
How are the single rooms at case for first year
american football
but also a ton of people watch the world cup
ohh ok
cant wait for euro cup
germans destroyed the scots ong
loft height for bed?

I lofted high
So my desk was under my bed and my room was much more compact
ok thanks adam
high loft gives around....4'8
you can store your drawers and fridge
... what
It meant I had more space
i meant thanks for the input
😭
we can always get a new roommate second year right?
You either choose your own housing group (aka with your friends) or get randomly assigned
so i can choose a new group basically?
what was tylerâ€™s reason? 😭
also any pros cons for upper lower floor dorms?
lol
ok my last question, meal plan; do i go unlimited or 17?
Thatâ€™s true but thatâ€™s why I asked about pricing, because if itâ€™s like $50 more then just do it probably
Did anyone here go 17 as a first year?
mid height
yeah what charlie said
for those reasons mid loft is superior
I just submitted as high 😭
You can change it later
Ahh
You can also submit a maintenance request to change your bed in the first two weeks of the semester
Within some business days
One of my fraternity brothers asked for a high loft bed in our house last semester and they stacked two bed frames on top of each other to do it 😭😭
They being the maintenance guys
What meal plan do you recommend if Iâ€™m commuting?
If you have access to free food, the cheapest one possible
There might be an exemption for commuters otherwise it's the 17 swipe one
Iâ€™m pretty sure there is one like with upperclassmen
Iâ€™m thinking of getting 5 or 7 swipes
Do you even need a meal plan if you're commuting?
The dining halls leutner and fribley only take swipes
Anywhere else you can pay afaik. Not sure about the den tbh
Ok so i think five would be better for me
Tbh it's probably cheaper to just buy food around campus than get a meal plan
But if your scholarship is paying for the meal plan . . . Go nuts
yeah
is that even possible? 💀
Maybe if you eat at a restaurant for every meal
That's like maybe 40 dollars a day
Eating at a restaurant for every meal is quite expensive
I remember this day
The Sherman to Clarke move day
it was objectively a lot of stuff... I overpacked pretty significantly
thankful I had like 10 friends to move me though
Any reason???
Or did this just happen out of the blue
i think he just found someone better ig haha
Roommate breakups hit the hardest 💔
haha yeah
Well, if they're flaking on you know they probably wouldn't have been a very good roomie anyway
I hope you find someone better or just get a decent random assignment
rascal house or hell's gets you to around 20-30 a day
Hellâ€™s?
Speaking from experience?
yes
😔
2 am drunk rascal house slice + hot wings combo>>>>
2am rascal house pretzel sticks
(Once again, I strongly advice against underage drinking)
They have pretzel sticks?
yes
huge ones
with cheese dip
Oooo
I've never actually walked into rascal house and ordered pizza
But I've eaten a lot of it through catering
is there wingstop there
No wingstop, but we have a bdubs
A list of restaurants on/around campus :

**Otani noodles- **high price small portion
**Phusion asian cafe-** taiwanese food, decent price
**Build the pho- **decent price, goated during the winter
**Indian flame- **a bit overpriced for their food
**Beyond juicery-** healthy stuff but kind of expensive
**Tacologist-** ok price for ok food
**Sittoo's-** lebanese food, not really worth it imo
**Rascal house-** mid pizza place but 11/10 when drunk (don't drink underage)
**Lee's seafood boil- **actually not a bad deal, food is mid 
**Hell's fried chicken-** average fried chicken joint

**Barrio Tacos- **mid
there's hella restaurants in coventry that are all very good, especially cilantro tacqueria
Chat can we pin this?
I personally disagree with some of these ratings (Indian Flame is pretty fire for example) but itâ€™s a good general guideline so sure
Pinned a message.
My fav Coventry restaurant is pacific east
bro did not just call barrio mid
Personally I'm not the biggest Barrio fan but I know a lot of people are
barrio good
whats ur beef with barrio
I got tacos there and they were pretty bland and lukewarm, and somehow the meat was dry despite the taco literally dripping water
I also think barrio is underwhelming
I am from Las Vegas and we actually have good Mexican food
so maybe my standards are just too high
cant wait for mid food
There are some bangers around campus
Why would you ever go to Barrio when you could go to Cilantro
my personal favorites are phusion cafe, indian flame, falafel cafe, and hell's fried chicken in the immediate campus area
I'll have to try cilantro, I never took the time to trek there
am big backed so i will try them all
i was fr confusing the two
lmao it happens
Yeah Cilantro is good
I got $500 worth of Cilantro for an event and it was fire
This is facts
I love Sittoo's
itâ€™s so good
Top 5 Places To Eat On Euclid (Adam Edition):
#5 Hell's
#4 Otani
#3 Build the Pho
#2 Sittoo's
#1 Indian Flame
Solid list
Iâ€™d put hells higher but I am also biased as a southerner with a soft spot for chicken and waffles
💀
you gotta try it it's on CSU campus
insanely large portions compared to indian flame
Sounds like I have to touch grass :/
and tastes reallly good
I will say their business lunch special is good
like $8 for a platter
Oh wow nice
barrio gave me raw chicken
💀
bombay chaat is really good
Pacific east is goated, their chicken katsu 😩😩🤌
There are also a lot of restaurants in Asia town that are nice lemme make another list
Omg yes and their curry 🤩
I combined all info that i have gathered so far
Feel free to give more input!
To add on pacific east has a large malaysian menu too
The best Italian restaurant is Mia Bella for sure
Their tomahawk ribeye 😩🤌
Ight ill add that on!!
Btw interesting fact, the guy who owns build the pho owns sweet spot too, if you get dessert at build the pho a sweet spot employeeâ€™ll bring it to you
thats not a popular take though 💀
Jolly has been ass
It was aight my freshman year
How do you know all this.. 😭
jolly has milkshakes that are pretty good, and their chicken tendies are solidly edible
the best part of jolly is the fact that its free
Yuhh
thats true the tenders are decent as are the milkshakes
Iâ€™m the informant for Cwru campus police 😎
do you know the mia bella owner (not) fun fact
The mafioso?
cw: rape
||charges of rape and kidnapping||
Oh yep, Little Italy is insanely fucked
Like actually insanely fucked up for such a small community
A second location in Coventry opened recently
No way thatâ€™s so comp
Also to add, Li Wah is like the only dim sum place around in Asia town you can get there by the RTA buses, foodâ€™s pretty good and not overly pricey
I go there every year for my bday 🥲
Wholesome
If you have a car seoul garden in Parma has really good Korean food

One of the best things about cwru is its incredibly funny building names
Whatâ€™s the most outlandish building name on campus?
Probably strosacker auditorium that gets called sackstroker a lot💀💀
I-LMAO
And our business building is named after the donor but since he donated the whole entire goddamn business building he gets to have his entire name so we got the Peter B. Lewis building aka PBL
Huge if true

it depends on where the diode is being used. The important thing is diffrent diodes have different IV curves and different diodes have different forward voltages. if he's building a distortion pedal where the diodes are being used as clipping diodes, then yes, which diode you use will matter. if they're being used for rectification or reverse polarity protection then no, it doesn't really matter
yes indeed i agree please i will help u find a way
For chicken and waffles hells is extraordinarily mid imo

Alex is diverting all the mosquitoes 🦟
y'all are gonna be moving in like amidst the heatwave so I'd come with some mosquito repellent
Nah Iâ€™ll just make sure Alex is nearby
But good tip
Good call
Oscar it has the last two years so I think luck is not on your side here
ladybugs are precious
Biochem should make a pesticide that only kill mosquitoes
I have a plan for this
We (re)introduce malaria to Ohio so now *everyone* is looking for a way to get rid of mosquitoes
Problem solved
Perfect
my plan 😁
frick them mosquitoes
im in italy rn
where the humidity is just right for mosquitos to breed, dine, and dash
Mosquitos have it out to get me I swear to god - I get bit constantly
im allergic to mosquitoes
ill get hives 3x the size of the original bite
Mosquito bite free since â€˜15😎
when i lived in naples they managed to circumvent the bugscreens and sometimes i would wake up with over 20 mosquito bites
how do you survive the summer? 🫣
problem solved
i live in the bay area 🤩
guys
im wine drunk
this is so
oww 😭
Wine drunk a different kind of drunk🤣
whats the difference btwn drunk and wine drunk
im new to this
There's no evidence that it's actually different, but a lot of people report feeling different when drunk from drinking wine
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Wine drunk makes me emotional, Regular drunk makes me feel confident.
what renter insurances r u guys using if ur using any
none
me when i forget theres slowmode on introductions

RAHHHH
Letâ€™s just steal a car
Group trip
jeddah on top

Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s at least one person at case whoâ€™s 21
i mean that is what theyre literally planning
i should be 21 by the time chicago comes thru
cwru f1 team raah
I mean other schools have one
u got a license?
Lets start an f1 team 😤😤😤
no
i have an indian license
ahhh
You can borrow my liscense
lol
yes both of us are indians
they wouldnt know
Exactly!
if they argue, pull the race card
hello im under the water
😭😭😭
i mean baja exists but its not exactly F1
Yeah facts 😔
we could have a f1 channel on here if there nuff people
gotchu
Or we could make another server
Channel is prob better
my dad (a lawyer but specializes in tax) got my mom out of a red light ticket by pulling the race card
that instilled doubt into officer's mind under oath so case got dismissed immediately lmao
man was thinking outside of the box
is your dad Saul Goodman by any chance
Thoughts on Tonyâ€™s?
it did, which is how the ticket got mailed to our house, but they could not prove it was actually my mom driving beyond reasonable doubt
💀
Thatâ€™s actually hilarious
judge dismissed
Lool
How much case cash is a good amount of case cash, also what should you put for additional lifestyle characteristics for room selection
i think the default is $150, that is enough
does unused case cash carry on to the next semester
Yes
nice
Case cash carrying over = more money for garlic noodles
exactly >:D
0
Wdym?
Case cash is worth the same as just having money lol
But if for example, your scholarship pays for some case cash or your parents do . . . Go for it
Ah got it
Donâ€™t forget to set case as your designated AP score receiver!!
When do the ap scores get released?
July 8th
oh god i'm not ready to see mine
something like 60% is a 5
yeah its crazy
I got a 3 on my AP Euro back in 2019
Anyone playing music here?
What kind
I almost did DCA
You from California?
Yep
Iâ€™ve always loved dci, Iâ€™ve just never been good enough to actually do it
Wait what's dca?
All-age
Now part of dci
All of u guys from Cali?
U?
Pennsylvania
A lil more than a drive
Probably not, but who knows
What do you play?
YO, IN PERSON???
yeah
ive got a friend marching with gold and two friends in bdc
Wait dunno if there's time to meet up, but wanna meet up 🤣
yeah sure im down
i hope theres time
Lol ye
Who do u know in bdc?
OMG YES 🤣🤣🤣
MARKERS FR 🤣🤣🤣
Oh yeah the capes
wow
Ye, but even without the capes, it's looking rlly cool
Iâ€™m usually not a big bd fam but the show might be super cool
*fan
No same
😬
and there might be a kid in colorguard? not sure
Aaaahhh got it
It's y I like bluecoats the most
Esp recently, it's been entertaining shows one after the other
🤣 dude, the admin at bdb literally said "we analyze how to get the most points"
It's all they care about
im so excited to watchthe mandarins
The Bluecoats show is gonna have something red, they kinda let slip the color of the drums
Eh, not as excited as last year
what do you play?
Bass trombone mainly
But contra for bdb
U?
Oh man Iâ€™d love to play contra
Lol not rlly
oh i see
It's 22 pounds being thrown around for 9 ish hours for 6 days a week
It's fun ofc
But also VERY tiring
for school i marched on trombone but im more of a sax and piano guy
it looks so cool tho
I played bari sax for marching band, I kinda sorta get the struggle 😂
Obviously not to the same level or period of time
If I were to march Iâ€™d probably try to learn baritone
U guys sound CRAZY fire tho
But ye, it's HEAVY
IK, IT RLLY IS
man is your back ok 😭
@ninjahsu are you planning on doing the case marching band?
NO 😀👍
Well it's alright
So ig it's ok
yikes
welp are you guys planning on doing any music stuff at case?
YES, OH GOD YES
I might do something eventually, but not at first
icic
lol what are you planning
But def wanna continue bass bone and tuba in concert
And then piano on the side for myself
U?
oh real
im trying to audition into music education on piano but we'll see how that works out
*glee club is cool*
There's a lot of cool music stuff
!!
im so excited to do barbershop with other people
Oh yeah it's lots of fun
itâ€™s a blast - I highly recommend it
I also like the lack of pressure in glee club
I am not interested in concert choir because it's just a bit more pressure than I prefer
GLEE. CLUB.
@cygnusxxii youâ€™re in Glee Club right
sure am!
Nice!!!
yeah i love glub. its more relaxed and generally more fun, but i do also appreciate the comparatively serious environment in concert choir
and concert choir has an alto section which is a big pro for me personally
are there any active martial arts clubs?
is there a place to browse club instagrams?
id like to know that too
Kendo is pretty active
I think there are a couple others but I don't know them off the top of my head
There are also clubs for taekwondo and kung fu I believe
is the taekwkndk club any good?
Campus groups is possibly the easiest way to find clubs
I have no idea
all good
I think the kung fu club is more active
😭
we can start it again, rebuild it from its ashes
ong
you used to do taekwondo?
or
currenrly do
Karate but I'm pretty familiar with taekwondo
mmm ic
I think itâ€™s be cool if they were like electronic and had lights that glitched throughout the show
Barbershop mentioned 😶
current students - is marching band at Case worth it? I'm from Indiana and did marching band and was drum major (so on and so forth, you get the gist) but i want to have time try new things and ensembles as well
@tazmania40 can probably answer pretty well
As someone from a pretty competitive ohio marching band, I enjoy it, but it's definitely a shift in both performance quantity and expectations.
It's a show band, so no competition pressure. There's a nice band culture and we put on ~3 decent shows a year (5-6 performances, so 2 performances per show)
As a music major, you'll get your gym credit through Eurythmics, but marching band would count as a secondary ensemble for you if you're interested. IMO try it and you can always drop in add/drop if you realize it's not your vibe.
If you want more info or have any other specific questions, let me know!
But faculty and associates tend to be older
Or on the other streets around campus
not just limited to case students but for anyone passing through university circle
i was following the project yield stuff for a little while and i remember them talkint about having no fatal collisions
tldr be vigilant when crossing euclid and mayfield and be ready to deal with distracted drivers or people running reds
^^
U good?
oh im totally fine
I am glad
if you do happen to get hit make sure you get the driverâ€™s insurance!!
Good advice
i being the genius i was just got up and kept going lol
what i do when they come at me is i keep walking, stare them down and try to memorize their plate while i wait for them to realize the error of their ways
does case differ from idiocy than nyc
if anyone can answer that
even if you have the crosswalk light drivers will absolutely still fly through turns!
Most people in Cleveland are about average for city drivers
yay!
😭 ever hydroplaned on a bike before
glad you lived to tell the tale
yeah!
impatient is the best way i describe cleveland drivers
so jersey drivers
summed up
Better than Jersey or mass drivers from what I've heard
@toojewforschool
They're about on par with Vegas drivers
Maybe comparable to like Philly or Pittsburgh drivers?
Hey watch it
ever heard of the jersey shuffle
No?
From one side to the other in one go
i had a friend who hydroplaned on a skateboard
How (are they alright?)
yeah shes fine
What an experience
so its a win i suppose
the physics behind hydroplaning are very funky
i've seen a few people try to model it
https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/46e959ed-fc9e-451b-9748-904d315bb3ed/content
do sophomore year dorms have AC?
i believe the new ones do
😭
are we allowed dehumidifiers?
:PES_Old:
you're not old, you're retro!
What does it say exactly?

yeah
i use touch id for authenitcation
ah i was told to not use the touch/face stuff cause its buggy
is there a way i can change it?
Thank you Mr. Bike Expert
Oh interesting
huh i did not know that
...yes
ever experienced california driving?
California implants are part of the reason my cost of living is going up 😭
When I was a kid my parents would point out to me how all the uncharacteristically shitty and reckless drivers had California plates
California #1 🏆 🇺🇸 🐻 🪙 🥑 🍞

For a second I thought they gave me more money but they only added the plus loan 😞
first thing we said when coming to cleveland: everyone drives so calm here 😭😭
What part of Cleveland did you go💀
Happy Juneteenth
ill be driving upstate, thankful for not living in jersey
the main city
Downtown?
yea
than get a loan
better route than the interest accrued
when did you receive the notice?
Like 2 days ago
i had to fill out this parent asset verification form cuz the fafsa and css had different criteria for assets lol
hopefully they donâ€™t give me less aid 😭
Nvm
:WAAAAAAA:
Something something transphobia 😭
Tbf since you said you get disability accommodations you should hopefully get a single room in any case
~~I think if u are in Hitchcock thatâ€™s gih?~~
Not exactly
Ah nvm
Cutler is the place where gender inclusive housing is, but it's not the whole dorm
Yea that makes sense
It's one (possibly two) quads that are designated as such
Gih is cedar mag
Yeah hope ur somewhere comfortable
Atleast that's what the website said when I looked
Yeah, Cutler specifically
They deny??
Yeah if there's too many people applying
Not enough spaces
Huh
Hopefully with the addition of the new sophomore dorms and stuff they're doing maybe space issues will be less of a concern
But like as Charlie said they would just label more or the dorms sections
I think they probably end up making that decision (of who gets the spaces) based on anyone who comes across as needing gih for their safety
I think in my freshman year there were sort of two gih quads
Ah yea
i thought they made us fill out the google form so they could make enough gih for everyone
Like there was the standard one, but the ra was non binary and I think one or two other trans/nb people lived in a second quad, but most of the people in that quad identified as women and I don't think applied for gih
Theoretically this is the case
But I do know a few people who have been denied from gih
Precisely 2 that I personally know
The two people I know who were denied from gih were (at the time) identifying as non-binary and had not undergone any medical or legal transition
oh boy
There are people I know who have been non-binary and non transitioning who have gotten into gih though
..
This does not bode well for me then huh
New red profile just dropped?? 🤯
I do honestly believe that they try to give gih to as many people as possible with the resources they're given by the university
I'm mostly speaking from what I know and what I've seen here, I'm not omnipotent. I hope that all of y'all who have applied for gih get placed into it and the other worries do not come to fruition
Rest of my profile is dark red and this is bright red
Probably going to change it again
wait i thought its the whole floor
No it's not
the more you know
https://i.imgur.com/wRsOIVB.png
trying to look at classes and stuff
i was looking at the difference between Connamacher's reviews and Ozguner's
but they're in two different semesters
Ah yeah, Daniel has been a TA under both
I had Connamacher for an upper-div CS course (CSDS 345) and loved him
should i only try to put 4 courses on there
if the seminar is just
going to show up by itself
making it 5 (I presume)
Yeah that makes sense
Did you get fall AIQS
oh right
You'll be okay
Especially because if it gets overwhelming, you can drop one
breadth thing
If my DE ones do transfer all of that should be covered by default i'd hope
https://i.imgur.com/FZOg3Gw.png
Interns making almost as much as the actual devs
not super unusual tbh
also a large chunk of that is just going to be making up for cost of living in san fran if they expect you to be on site
I think the poverty line in SF is >$100K
wild
I grew up on 18
O
I
I'm pretty sure I make as much as an intern as a new full time hire at my firm
.
😭
Some of the most random classes
"history of rock and roll"
Is it actually just a geography class?
```This course surveys the musical practices of the rock and roll era, broadly defined to include much popular music since the 1950s. Music majors are to enroll in MUHI 312. Offered as AFST 212 and MUGN 212.```
https://i.imgur.com/ZRxI2XN.png

so far its only italian 101
sages has interesting topics
my freshman one was caskets and corpses
I found history and philosophy of science to be easy, fun, and it knocks out a lot of ugers
think the big issue im having is limiting it to tuesday thursday
Got it - do u know how to filter by days and requirements in sis
yeah thats what im doing
just rough finding intro classes and the like
its how i found italian but thats been it basically
Look at the social sciences for Tuesday Thursday classes
They have more of them
Cognitive science, psychology, sociology, anthropology
All tend to have a lot of tr classes
ive heard rlly good things abt that one
yeah anthropology 102 is almost certinly offered tr and it counts for 2 uger perspectives
do you guys think a bike is a useful thing to have on campus?
If you enjoy riding a bike more than walking, it can be
Bring it
Also I am currently looking to buy a new computer for school. As a Mechanical engineering student do I9 that can run rendering software or will an I7 be fine
For engineering just make sure you have windows
i figured
Also get something with at least 16gb ram or that you can upgrade to 16
Running solidworks on 8gb ram is kind of ass
good to know
Howâ€™d it break
Hole in tire - I think?
And one of the screws was loose
as much ram as you can get
i5 is plenty, i7 helps. you want the fastest single-threaded performance you can get for engineering. if you're going a lot of CAE you're either doing it on baja's "cluster" of GPUs or case's supercomputer
sweet
obligatory you should join baja
yeah? ive been thinking abt it
we have fun, and cool cars, and cool people
and internship opportunities if that's the kind of thing you're into
does anyone know how work-study works?
i know itâ€™s a job around campus but what specifically and how
Iâ€™m pretty sure it just depends on whatâ€™s available
I got rejected from a few before I actually got a job
how much do jobs on campus pay
can u get paid thru research assistant
Eventually you can
In general $10-12
If you become a TA for a wealthy department you get paid around $15
Bc most on campus jobs are reception iirc
The best part abt it is if youâ€™re working at a gym youâ€™re literally getting paid to just sit there and do your hw
good to know! I want to go into music instrument manufacturing so it might not apply to my career field. Do you think it helps with understanding coursework at all? especially for ME
it just makes you a good engineer tbh
also making instruments is cool (thats how I got into EE) but it's always good to keep your options open
engineering is not something that can solely be taught in a classroom. the only good engineers are those who have practiced it a *ton*
ah gotcha
how often do you guys meet?
we're usually doing something most days
https://cwrumotorsports.com/
is he now?
*also when i say instrument i mean like musical instruments lol
what kinds of instruments?
yes baja is lame cool kids join consult your community at weatherhead and
might have to do this ngl 😹
Which departments are wealthy
lemme rephrase, departments wealthy enough to hire hella TAs, all TAs get paid $15 I'm p sure
Woah! Where was that?
Yoooo
That just confirmed it no way Iâ€™m not joining 🤩
How do yâ€™allâ€™s decide who drives?
we have tryouts where people drive a course and we see who is fastest
i've driven the past three years cars
This NYC weather is pretty nice
well rn i have an internship manufacturing oboes
that's cool
but honestly wherever i can get into their engineering department
thx
I got into EE by building synthesizers
oooo nice
oboes is interesting
so rn im in manufacturing but they said if i continue to intern there i could move into engineering later
ooooo cool
Formlabs
nice
Just saw someone say they got a stem internship
They're a junior in highschool
lmao welcome to the land of impostor syndrome
I probably should not open my mouth
wait till you start working
how is that imposter syndrome, more like STEM major inferiority complex
Honestly idrc what I get as far as internships/co ops go long as I get *something* and it pays like
but i'll take 17 :catstand:
Aim higher than that for a tech internship imo
makes sense but also it's what I've seen for lower end
Do think about the quality of the experience you get along with the money. Ideally and usually higher quality internships come with higher pay, but if you can afford to take a slightly less well paying internship it may be better for long-term goals depending on what that internship is
so true, experience is everything
Do the dorms have roof access
For legal purposes, no
Itâ€™s finally my turn to pick rooms tomorrow
nice view
the view of clarke 8th floor facing leutner is pretty sweet
Hereâ€™s a photo from a parking lot on adelbert
Howâ€™d it go?

Which building is that
Bingham
Dayum
Id be okay w that
Especially if housing is paid for
yeah
and they gave us a metro pass which is nice
yeah I would be much richer if I chose a normal job
but this is opening up so many doors for me so itâ€™s worth it
Yes but at the same time I'm going to be
So I want to get to a point I can just pay for it myself and also yk

U can make 3k easily in a summer

If my mom takes the plus loan my costs go to 0
OH i just saw this :uwu: 
requesting to add "Wen's Kitchen" and "Dagu Noodle" to the asian food section
wen's has the most authentic sichuan food i've ever eaten in a restaurant in my 13 years in cleveland (located in the same building as ha ahn)
and dagu is just huge portions of delicious noods and boba (they recently moved location to right across the street from li wah and i went yesterday~, super fancy)

Oh Lindsey you're a Clevelander?
Ohio 💀
💀
HELP whATTT
boba and those manho slices look so good
yes i moved here from cali when i was 5 💀
Where in California (important question)
the mango was delishhh
it was called "mango cheese" and i got excited :mochicheese:
stanford campus
Bay Area
yuh
Mid region of California tbh
agreed
the campus is like the only good part
I never lived around there (only East Bay for me, woohoo) but my dad did and he said it was gorgeous
they have cows :mochihehe:
and a hill
Hooray for cows
Cows are so cute
agreed
stinky but cute
Like ferrets
Or foxes
Or compsci students
Added 👍
slay :smirkhandman:
Aww, you think they're cute
Of course
They think they have souls it's adorable
:nyasSmack:
\:)
omg thank you 🥺
Iâ€™m just here for a couple days
Itâ€™s better today
Esp in hitchcock
Woah I was born in California and also moved to Ohio when I was 5
Where in Cali
State*
Other one is possible as well \:-)
twinsies :Friendsforever:
Palm Springs
Hey is anybody else in smith
Me and my roommate have only managed to find one other set of dudes in smith
Do you mean anyone else at all or any other dudes
Other dudes
Because at least my year, Smith had 2 girls' floors and 1 boys' floor so that could explain it
Yeah
All the other floors are girls and Iâ€™m curious
Iâ€™m just surprised that I havenâ€™t seen anybody else on our floor. We are in the class of 28 chat and the juniper dorms chat and only one other guy is on our floor
Keep in mind there's a good 1500 incoming freshman and about 30 guys who live in Smith
It's a number game
👋 but im a girl
what chat?
Oh mb, good luck
I got invited to one on instagram
If you add me I can add you
👍
Any Cutler house chats?
Is that the juniper one
Cutter is Juniper
Cutler is one of the other two
Cutler is Cedar-Mag
Oh wow yâ€™all will be here in less than two months
Kinda crazy ngl
I bet* it will seem real long until August 15
Or anything crazy like that nahh
Yeah no way
Bro this was exactly my mindset 😭
I'm not built that way
i see how it is
@idkwutmyusernameis2931 stop lurking and talk
Iâ€™m out rn but when I get home Iâ€™ll see if I can find them
Do you two know each other or something
Busy
I have the book for calc III since its the same one csu uses, unless the proficiency test site lies
We do
~~Skill issue???~~
No def is dw ik
which one is it
Oh that's right
Niceeeee
editions are a scam to make you buy more textbooks
I have a pdf copy of it too
Dude same
if a prof says "read this section in the textbook" I will probably not lol
but I do go to lecture and take notes so I usually do fine
I touched this textbook twice in 3 semesters
I do all my readings for social studies classes
:WAAAAAAA:
Not that difficult
perfect
it helps if you get involved with RHA
what's that?
reisdent hall association, student housing organization
gotcha
More people apply to be RAs than people who are accepted to be RAs. I would not rely on it as a guaranteed part of your plan, but the acceptance rate is not exceedingly low either
Here's some additional info on the topic I wrote previously: https://discord.com/channels/1198835515911327934/1198836016899969094/1231719714431172740
So I guess we'll have to see what happens
Hopefully gih will pull through for you
What the hell how do u not have the Meckes Bible
I got it as a loan from el bookstore
It cost me $20 only
So
When is move in day for you guys?
Move in day for freshman is mostly the same, but I think international students move in a day or two early
Returning students usually start coming back to campus during the freshman orientation week, aside from members of Greek life who help with freshman move in, who usually move in a day before the freshmen
Right on 🤙🏼
speaking from personal experience, my mom booked hotel room a day before move-in day, so she emailed housing if i could just move in the night before and they said yeah lmao
Lol, it might be more lax in the spring
The fall is a whole production
helping the class of 27 move in was brutal
hot asf
Dude it was FUN
Not that Iâ€™ve ever used said gift card but whatever
and got side eyed and bitched out by parents
Heat builds character
For what???
Yeah lmao I did like 8 hours and it was rough
or right when they started handing out ice cream
I was there until lunch
https://tenor.com/view/among-us-gif-20239200
That was the only time Leutner had good food
Does Leutner ever truly have good food?
homecoming/first week of the semester
I did two shifts on move in day because like
Might as well
Not like I'm doing anything else
Sleeping
And it was good that I did last year because so many people did morning only that afternoon was in rough shape
Needed all hands on deck lol
I canâ€™t wait to help with move in
same I can't wait to get mean mugged by parents again
During my first help of freshman move in if I accepted tips I would've made $100
do you have to be an OL to help w move in? ima probably be on campus and wouldn't mind lending a hand :abcinspector:
Itâ€™s people in Greek life who do
:bcfedup:
OLs do not get paid enough to help w move in too😭😭
If youâ€™re willing to help Iâ€™m sure weâ€™d take all the help we can get
anyone wanna take enamel and jewelry w me 🫶🏻🫶🏻
ooooo nice :catbugpastelpink:
Is that a class or a piercing trip
Hey, if yall are interest hereâ€™s a Taplin group chat: https://ig.me/j/AbaxyCZcJYoHDq-E/
Why limit yourself to one possibility
Two guys next to me in the airport are playing Minecraft
Most wholesome stuff Iâ€™ve seen all day
but i wanna take the class more
oh does anyone know how to get rid of a piercing keloid
Usually you need to talk to a dermatologist I think
and squishy
might just be a piercing bump
whereâ€™s the piercing at?
yoo freshman move in sign up form just dropped
helix
r there any nursings '27 or older here
or is there anyone that yall know of
I know a number of them
could any of them be willing to give me advice for first yr course planning
I think that in nursing your courses get scheduled for you
At least for first year
Unless they changed that
yeah how does course registration go?
cause like i heard you can add them to your cart in sis and just select with that
but then what if some are unavailable
our nursing classes are scheduled for us and we receive that early july, when registration comes we only have to sign up for a breadth course or elective
You do a permission request and do your best puppy dog eyes for the professor lol
You add the courses you want into your shopping cart, then select them and hit enroll right at the moment enrollment opens for you
Then you wait 1-20 minutes until it stops loading, you find out what classes you got into, and you do damage control
You want to go to a place w/ good WiFi when umcourse registration opens
Out of curiosity what classes do nursing majors take as freshmen
Like the ones that are scheduled for you
BROOOO i like made a simulation schedule
i have no space for chemistry principles this is devastating
I think for breadth I'm prob gonna do spanish and try for a spanish minor
Which one?
i want to do kinesiology for dance and sports performance, which requires intro to sport medicine (i have a lot of personal experience in sports med, and i used to dance, so i thought it would be really interesting), i was also thinking of a potential sports med minor
I will shill English classes for breadth. There are a ton of really great 200-300 level English classes
Dance classes in general seem super cool from what Iâ€™ve seen (I know a dance major)
Maybe just start with intro to sports medicine? Or a dance class. If that's your area of interest
I would generally not recommend hopping into a 300 class in the first semester
iâ€™ll probably just end up going psychology for this first semester if that even fits in my schedule
if you're thinking about the minor take the intro to sports med class imo
^ seconding this. It depends on the department (some 300s are more approachable than others), but talk to the profs and advisors before you take any 300 level class and TRUST THEM
thatâ€™s what my advisor said, wait until sophomore year to try it. i was looking into a dance class but im still not 100% recovered from an injury so not sure if i would be able to do it for first semester
I started taking 300 level courses in sophomore year and it was a pretty big difficulty jump
#course-planning

This is the fridge yâ€™all are getting
niceee
dannnng
Y'all are lucky
thats way bigger than i expected
How could you figure out when the nursing classes are scheduled, im struggling ngl
i used the curriculum example as reference
I see thatâ€™s smart
they have a list of available times in stellic
No way they actually did it
no way

best math professors at case?
Szarek, Meckes, Tran, Singer, Meckes, Orendain, Langer, and Meckes are all pretty good
Meckes is THE choice for linear algebra, Tran is good for calculus and diff eq, and other courses have their own bests
youâ€™re the goat adam
Smh Julia is the slayest
Zhao is also pretty good imo
I would say most of the math faculty at case are good
Let me put it this way
If you ditch, you do not skip Meckes linear algebra. It it more accurate to say that Meckes linear algebra skips you
@cawu is this accurate
All jokes aside, the linear algebra (307) profs are good, but Meckes literally wrote his own textbook and teaches it every semester so that should say something
christopher butler is amazing
😭
Perhaps
But i think i can manage with AB and BC again tbf
Light breeze
I just saw
You can also test out
Maybe I am thinking about AP Lang
thank the lord
Do you get credit or no?
or just skip?
I imagine you get the credit, but no gpa attached
ok ok thats good
so at least itâ€™ll count towards graduation
Ap lang credit is scuffed here lol. You have to take a 300 level English course and get a certain grade to get retroactive transfer credit for an AP lang 4 or 5
Should be fine
Why do people take English then if theyâ€™re not required
💀
This academic seminar thing is confusing
Because they enjoy it
Or for breadth
ahh I see
I suppose then
They'll pull your name out of a hat to give you a fall or spring writing seminar
Then, after course registration, you'll get to select a group of them that fit your schedule and you'll get one of them
Does AP Lang/Lit add on extra hours after you complete a 300 level english course ?
Basically
Word
If you have an ap lang/lit 4+ and get I think a B or higher in a 300 level English class, you get a 200 level English transfer credit (wow!)
Any good breadth recommendations?
What are you interested in?
Because the recommendations vary wildly depending on your rough areas of preference
What do you recommend?
Like I want to see other opinions first
I had fun taking religion and ecology as well as intro to greek history. Next semester I'm taking an anthropology course on Chinese culture and society
That's not a breadth course tho lol
Yes yes that I will for sure do
I was thinking about a chinese language course
That could be a good choice!
Yup
You should email the Chinese department to see what course would be appropriate in this case (CWRU reference?) because Iâ€™m sure they see this situation frequently
My mom's side of the family is Chinese but they live in Indonesia
Iâ€™ll do it soon
Yeah 😭
College language courses are also significantly harder than high school ones
Figured
Hence why it's like "oh boy you got a 5 on ap Chinese? Well here's Chinese 201"
Lol pretty true
I do know some people who are exceptions to that. Mostly Latin
Yeah itâ€™s crazy
dedication is insane
Mastering mandarin is one of my personal goals but it's not really at the forefront
That was me
Im ngl
Lmao it be like that
Abc grindset
I went to Chinese afterschool where my brothers and I were the only white people there and kids made fun of our eyes for being too round 😭
LOL
Prominent childhood memories from that place frfr
How to introduce your kids to racism 😭
Naw the stereotype be real LOL 💀💀💀
I'm wasian so I am like. The weird looking cousin on both sides of the family
In photos it's like "what is that guy doing here"
Wasians are special in the asian community
Anomalies that become great
My good family friends are Wasian and Americans think theyâ€™re Asian and Japanese people think theyâ€™re white
When I was a kid the aunties used to tell me to be a model 😭 now they just tell me I'm fat (sometimes as an insult sometimes as a compliment)
brahhhh
Lmao yeah this definitely happens, I get to be the token white guy and the token person of color
Me and @quinsential writing a lexer be like:
Anyways, it was nice chatting for the night
Good night Peter
Oh shoot I gotta go to bed 😭
Enjoy your night
Erm. I think that right now it is 1pm for you
How about a biscuit?
It is current GMT+2
It is 9:13 AM
Lol I guess I assumed you were farther east
Or west. Depending on your perspective
Lot of time
Not enough but some
Just gotta keep truckin
Remember how I asked in the Dungeon about time spent awake? Thatâ€™s because I set a new record yesterday!!! 🥰
30?
50?
10000
Like 22
Dude 50 hours would be crazy
Today my brother hit 28 or 29 I think
Ooooooof
Ah.
So now he's gotta double extra fix it
Thatâ€™s the opposite of fixing
Ooooof
Because we travelled through a 15 hour jump
Peace be upon ye Adam Hutchings
Rest be upon me hopefully
Amen
You lucky duck, good night Charlie
😴
😡
nuh uh mine clears yalls any day
my ap calc ab teacher was a real one

ppl who think calculus is fun are all masochists
i thought calc 1 (ab) was fun, calc 2 no (loved christopher butler tho)
calc 1 was great and i warmed up to calc 2. im anti calc 3 tho
i love proofs 🙂
Proofs are fun sometimes
thats real
Why anti calc 3? Calc 3 was my favorite of the bunch
i think its less the material and more how i learned it
Calc 3 was a simpler time in my life
I heard calc 3 is more fun than 1 and 2
much more interesting imo
although the calc 2 series stuff is very interesting for signal processing and controls
You should take MATH 308 with Juan Orendain next semester and change your mind
Or for real though if youâ€™re an EE take complex analysis
Our two signal processing classes are basically complex lite
Whatâ€™s the parent programming about for CWRU?
they tell the parents stuff about case lol
Ok so Iâ€™m gonna assume not really that important
https://tenor.com/view/wave-gif-23969287
👋
Yeah taylor was cool
ewww
Bro why
That stuff is the best
I love a good ratio test
i have blocked out series and cannot remember a thing and do not want to
💀
MathBot works again
It is a good day

If anyone here is a certified real one and King Gizzard enjoyer theyâ€™re having a concert at Jacobâ€™s pavilion (~25 mins from Case) on Aug 24
King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard??
Have no idea who the band is but I'll check out their music bc I am always down for a concert lmao
and they have a goated name
Maaaan
yessuh
they are dope my favorite album is flying microtonal bananas
Could take a whole group tbh bc itâ€™s when we are on campus
I mean who would dislike an album called flying microtonal bananas
ikr you'd be a psychopath not to
Fr fr
King gizzard is actually great for work flow, really puts one in the zone
that's a 1d schrodinger
Is that in calc 3/diff eq?
Is anyone here in Storrs?
they pump out albums like crazy id be surprised if anyone does
I know at least one person who does but they are not on this server
I keep getting followed by cwru people on Instagram
Cause I follow the 28 class page
But like I'm not following these people back 😭
me too, i usually check out the profile and their major and stuff then decide
or if they are in my dorm building
or I'll just dm them and chat a lil bit first
that's wild I just add whoever
The more the merrier
i add whoever
lmao
idc
Yeah ig if you wanna be selective with your following I also donâ€™t care you do you
tbh I rarely check my folllow requests
Thatâ€™s probably good it cannot be the best environment to nurture mental health idk
some felons are chill
its a way for me to remember some things
and get artistic inspiration
or make up inspiration
True
better than having numbers just to have it rot on ur phone forever
I think I definitely message more through insta than messages fosho
i add anyone with mutual followers or who goes to my school
i add no one because i hated social media and hid my account :crylaugh:
I add only people I personally know
i think its more common where i live
to use insta as main comm
I took the discord-pill
It's just much nicer for communication imo
most of my friends at case use discord
I feel like the other barrier for me is that sending random reels is a great way to spark a conversation or maintain a sense of connection
I do send people random reels sometimes, but we don't really talk through that usually
I have fallen in love with discord
I also sometimes save funny videos and send them to people on discord
I do that w/ my sibling
Yeah I reply the most reliably to discord messages
🫠
Yay permission granted 🤩
huh

leaning towards AsiaTown but also a few more, any recs?
1. cultural gardens
2. tower city
3. coventry
i signed up for asiatown lol
hows Gordon square?
i've actually never been that far west downtown XD
i just know they have theares and a lot of murals


YOOOO
This is the best news they've ever given me
love to see my wage go from $15 to $16
South Carolinas minimum wage is 7.25
I made 8.25 at McDonald's
I'll be doubling it 😭😭
dang thats not much, most food places here pay a good bit more than that
at least like 12
california minimum wage is 17....
i doubt this is for students
minimum wage before was 15 but wade and a lot of other places pay like 10-11
Oh well
Ohio's minimum is still higher than anything I ever made before
Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s staff
Because I was paid $11/hr for my campus job which is not $15
Ye

7.25???
I thought Ohio's minimum wage was 10 😭

Doesn't it release in a week? Just wait 😭
impatient ass
Lol yâ€™all are wild
Iâ€™m not 😔 are you
I checked too lmao
YEAH CASE IM AWAITING MY HOUSING TOO
supposedly ENGR is going up this year from 13.10, but we shall see.

One thing that always gets me
Is how *fast* they respond to emails
My god
I literally sent this 10 minutes ago
ronald loui emailed me after 1am multiple times
I sent an email at 1 or 2 am and got a response before 6 am by a prof once
I had a ta for a bio lab that would respond to messages sent at like 2 am. (I also had a ta for engr 131 that would respond to messages at 2 am. Thanks @tazmania40)

thinking of getting one of these for college
mandatory training
💀
https://i.imgur.com/PFy5Ofg.png
You gotta do them
Be prepared for many more lol
O-week has a few in person sessions and you have to do another hazing training for clubs and club sports
Greek life has extra stuff as well
And while that's fine for on campus I wonder how much people go to Cleveland
You can get to downtown Cleveland very easily from the health line or red line. 

You can even take the redline to Ohio City
Case students get free transit passes and it's like a 20 minute ride on the red line to downtown. 
And the red line runs with 15 minute frequency
Oh they're free
Red line is the train
Now I'm really confused on what they meant by $500 for transportation
Health line is BRT
Ohh
Thankfully those r my mom's expenses not mine :prayge:
You get an rta pass as part of your fees to the school
And that allows you to use the bus and train systems in Cleveland to your hearts content
Campus is pretty well connected in terms of busses
yeah i ubered to the airport once and thats bc a friends mom was paying and she offered that i could join
Do you cs people in here think I should use Linux in college rather than windows or does it not matter
Most CS people I know duel boot windows and Ubuntu. But they are also doing ROS stuff that needs Ubuntu.

I also know a couple CS people who have heavily customized Arch installs, but I think they are just doing that for fun
When I was little my caretaker messed around with raspberry Pi's and Linux with those so I saw it but
That was as far as I ever got with it
Windows is well rounded
Linux is faster
Not too big of a difference unless you like speed
Hey nerds you can kinda see ap scores on sis
😞
I do both 🙃
my ssh config is spaghetti
fear
it is only slightly slower than running altium native on my desktop
Huh. Nice!
it also cranks through NX, which is just solidworks but better
(and more expensive)
Does transferred means i got credit :0
I think so yes
in SIS under course history I think
wait there's like mandatory hazing as our training to enter a club or is it training to avoid hazing
Training to avoid hazing
that;s good to hear
Case and Ohio as a whole are very strict on hazing so itâ€™s almost nonexistent at Case
^^ohio is super duper strict. hazing involving drugs/alcohol is 3rd degree felony
Lmao, mandatory hazing for everyone would be crazy
Don't let yourself get hazed, no organization is worth it
frat initiation 💀
not all frats ofc
The hardest part of initiation is standing there while people talk and remembering your lines 😭
Greek life is definitely more chill on case campus vs a lot of other schools I've heard about
Yikes 😭 if that's true someone should report it
real
Lol
The line can get blurry in terms of what you might want to do and what people are pressuring you to do, especially as sometimes over time what started out as a fun practice can become a mandatory tradition
True
Incentive to become a brother :p
So usually a good fraternity or sorority will err on the side of caution in terms of avoiding those types of situations, even if it seems a little odd from the outside
You might see me show up you never know
Once we have our rush calendar Iâ€™ll probably ask permission to toss it in this server
Mean itâ€™s just the good thing to do
Like dishes does not take that long or something else
Iirc none of us can advertise any chapter specific Greek life things until the Sunday immediately before classes
As an ex-recruitment chair I should know these things lmao
Ah yep
Usually there will be a couple Greek life introduction events during orientation week
But rush/recruitment does not start until the first day of classes
Itâ€™s like when you try to fight over holding the door open
I was VERY not interested in Greek life my first sem so I did not know this. We stay learning in this discord server
Lol yeah, or "you hang up" "no I insist, you hang up" on a phone call
No u
Yep just goes on forever
I feel like some of that might just be getting to know each other everyone new at college nerves
Is Greek housing cheaper than regular uni housing
I did not even expect it to be remotely an option
Depends on the chapter, usually room and board is cheaper for a Greek org vs just through the university
Yeah I mean i always saw Greek life as a 'if there's a numerical benefit to doing it then why not" but otherwise had 0 interest
But yeah the general guideline is that we're allowed to talk about our experiences with Greek life and its presence on campus overall, but no advertising your particular chapter until rush starts
Depends, but usually it comes out slightly cheaper. And depending on chapter you might not be on university meal plan. I will always say tho, try not to let price be why you join a Greek org. Do it for the people, cause thatâ€™s how/where youâ€™ll spend your time and energy
The saving money aspect also is tied to living in your chapter house in most cases
Yeah, I think that the low end of yearly dues for Greek life is probably 800-900 dollars
Not all chapters make their dues/housing costs public
Yeah, depending on how you pay for college, the money for dues and for housing might come from different places
The financial considerations can get kind of confusing though
Also to the general point on Greek life:
- fraternity recruitment will take place during the first three weeks of each semester
- sororities will have a formal recruitment period that will take place in the spring, and incoming students will not be able to join a sorority until then
Apparently going to SIS letâ€™s you see what classes have been transferred
Course history
It may tell you if you're getting transfer credit- but not necessarily what the number score was
I can tell Iâ€™m cooked

for this I just get an error?
when I click the link
i can see them
like the scores?
not the scores
but they show that theyve been transferred
You would be able to see if an AP score applies to transfer. This would be the case only if the AP score matches the minimum required to transfer.
even the ones i took this yr (snr yr)
can you link the website
its on ur sis
sis > academics > grades & history > course history
if u need help finding where those r i can gladly send ss
I can only access last year scores. but also I might be completely cooked with non-transferable APs or 3s lol
got a 4 or higher on german yay
WOOOOO
Oh phew thanks guys
None of my de classes r there 😞
Would've been nice if I could squeeze out of the breadth requirements
All i got was psych
Is there any guarantee that theyâ€™ll accept or reject my dual enrollment credits before course registration opens?
unless you have a surplus
i have no dual enrollment credit because of this
It is what it is
for me it was a mix of
Wouldnâ€™t recommend hitchhiking unless youâ€™re with a buddy or two
personal experience?
Naw
Yes
We do some mid-semester stuff but the majority of our recruits are from the beginning of the semester

guys is fall break only 2 days
Yes
Wait till you find out how long thxgiving is😂
How long is it 🫥
Also 2 days
😂😂😂😂
So everyone spends the whole time flying (unless ur from Ohio or smthg)
People tend to leave Wednesday and some classes will cancel Wednesday but yeah itâ€™s 2 days off plus the weekend
Iâ€™m pretty sure every fraternity rushes fall and spring, Iâ€™m talking about rushing after the initial round of bids have been given
At least theta chi has not done that. If we feel it's necessary there may be a way to have an exception and do it, but it's not common practice
sororities who dont fill their slots in formal rush will usually also have informal in the spring
We usually hold a few more events throughout the semester and sometimes give out a bid later on, but if we give out a late bid the person usually has to be okay with being part of the class of the next semester, so it doesn't happen that often. There are pretty strict requirements for us as to the minimum length of time between becoming an associate member and an initiate
Glee club usually does a fall break trip that I'm part of instead of going home, and for Thanksgiving break I stayed with one of my fraternity brothers in freshman year and with my significant others family in sophomore year
I could not imagine a more reinvigorating and meaningful way to spend your thanksgiving break than that
gotcha, that all makes sense
My pro tip is to know people who live closer to campus that will invite you to stay at their house 😎
I may be contacting my connections at some point
yeah something like that
is it common in case to be coerced into alcohol/drugs?
relative to other top 50 schools
this is to upperclassmen
There are definitely plenty of people who drink or smoke weed, but I haven't heard any stories of people being pressured to partake
Some people will definitely offer, but no one gets offended if you say no
oh ok good
a hs alum got his drink spiked
I have not heard any of these stories at case
🙏🙏
Yeah Case is pretty chill
am not interested on ruining my life w anything
Pretty much same for me
yep yep
Other than jolly karaoke but that's mostly for the karaoke
I'm sure there's some people who would think you're no fun for being sober, but those people aren't good people to hang out with anyway
THERES KARAOKE?
sign me tf up wait
The jolly scholar does karaoke nights every Thursday
I've had friends offer to sit at the bar to get water for me before at karaoke, very epic.
Yeah I ask for water at the bar at karaoke
They just give it to you
ye
Their book of songs is huge
what is zombieoke
On the second-to-last day of HvZ a bunch of folks often go to jolly karaoke to munch on brainz.
I go during zombieoke (the hvz thing) and after glee club performances
Yeah lmao my chapter live streams our initiation
It's not that exciting
But you can watch it
spiking can happen although it is pretty rare, just don't drink stuff from strangers and you're straight
HUH
You can watch it on our Instagram if you have nothing better to do lol
We are non-secret, so our chapters and rituals and stuff are open
oh wait you're DU I forgot
Yeah
thought you were tx for a second 💀
Lol nah I just am friends with a lot of them
It's kinda funny that I spend more time at the theta chi house vs like phi psi despite the fact we share a wall
💀
You will probably be okay
Chem 111 has a lot of work that's just drilling your understanding of chem with things like aleks
It's an intro level class that covers a decent amount of material, but intro classes are usually pretty understanding that not everyone had the same high school background and try to get people on equal footing
It may be to your benefit to look at some Khan academy or something for some basic chem
Is phy 122 dependent on phy 121. Like does it expect you to know certain things because you already took phy 121?
121 is mechanical i think
122 is electro
I would assume two totally different
Ik they're different topics but I'm not sure if they are  dependent since it's a pre req
if you know how to integrate I think youâ€™ll be fine
yeah ive been using khan as well
to preview chem
Kind of?
Enroll in calc 1
😭
💀
I had a guy who did that to get into my calc 3 class in freshman year
ok so you recommend I put calc 1 into my cart first?
Yes
iâ€™d rather retake calc 2 tbh
Okay then just worry about passing the calc 1 proficiency exam during o-week
It's a big lecture
will our advisors tell us about the proficiency exams?
like the days when it happens?
or will it just be offered
ok im asking a redundant question 😭
iâ€™ll assume they tell us
I'm not entirely sure how signing up for one works, but I remember it being on my orientation week schedule
do you know how long they take?
ok ok that simplifies it
They're testing your cumulative knowledge on the subject to see if you're ready for the next level
do they have FRQs or just mcqs?
@tazmania40
They might have a sample test on the website but I'm not sure
I think that's posted on the website
Like if you just search proficiency exams at cwru im pretty sure it'll take you to the website where you can register
I just saw
So when we enroll in one class, does the SIS system automatically get rid of all the other classes for that one classâ€™s time slot?
so it forces you to build around that one class?
Err, not exactly
yeah thatâ€™s what I mean
so if I chose a class lets say 12 - 2 PM
all other classes for 12-2PM wouldnt be available
do you have to manually check your schedule?
You will still be able to add other 12-2pm classes to your shopping cart and see them in stellic or the course enrollment screen
Pretty much yeah
or does it stop you?
No
ok thatâ€™s good
so there is a safety feature then
You will not be able to enroll in a course that you do not have the prerequisites for or that overlaps with another class, unless you get a special permission request
You can however enroll in two classes that have no time in between them
I see
So you'll have to check for that manually, especially with labs that don't adhere to the regular class schedules
Labs and recitations are usually the main causes of messiness though
Just use stellic
The visual aid is nice to seeing if things are overlapping
Is stellic apart of SIS?
or separate app?
Yes, if you look at courses and enrollment it'll be under course scheduler or a similar name
It technically takes you outside of sis but it's not exactly a separate app
Here's a stellic guide
https://case.edu/registrar/registration-classes/degree-planning
We used to have a different tool but stellic is pretty nice too
And do you know the difference between just lecture and recitatiom?
Lectures cover new material with the professor
Sometimes recitations have quizzes, depends on the class

A lot of intro level courses will have 3 lectures a week and a once a week recitation to help you master the material
Yes
There are no courses that are only a recitation
why is there just a lecture option?
For calc two you will pick the combination of a lecture and a recitation that you enroll into
TWO???
ohhhh
The lectures are all the same, but the recitations are scheduled differently
recitation is only 1 day a week
icic
Yes
hmmmm
this is a bit interesting
It'll be like a regular lecture three times a week, then a recitation with a TA that you can choose the time that works best
does this not fk up the schedules?
😭
Usually when you're taking that standard stem freshman schedule you mostly have mwf lectures so recitations and labs get free reign on Tuesday and Thursdays
why are there so many sections for calc 2?
icic
Because it's a big class and recitation sections are small
There might be 500 people in a lecture but only 30-50 in each recitation
Most classes that have recitations also are that way because they are very large lectures
so everyone will attend mond wednes friday
Yes
it will always be 11:30 to 12:20
for everyone in calc 2
for first semester
That's because there are quizzes, and they're all the same
So if the recitations were spread out some people would be at an unfair advantage or disadvantage
yes for recitations
You have it backwards
oops
youâ€™re right
8:30 is the lecture, 11:30 is the recitation
man 😭
so I should just pick any 122 class then if thatâ€™s the case?
Yep
I mean, they'll be different TAs, but there's no way to know which ones will be which ahead of time
So yes just draw a straw out of a hat or something
just lecture
There is

Off semester in this case means taking a class when most people are not taking the class btw. Such as calc 2 in the fall or chem 111 in the spring
The additional meeting is a recitation
ahhh
but there is only 1 option 💀
9:30 cmonnnn
yeah itâ€™s wacky
Usually a class that is 4 credits is such because it has a lecture plus a recitation or a lab
Calc 2 shows the recitations and the lecture as the sub class and calc 1 shows the lecture and the recitations as the subclass
Yeah it can be a little confusing
especially for physics???
Yes
Oh no, did you have to write reports? 😭
like 10 pages
Maybe I am tweaking
Lots of procedures and usually you want to start your lab analysis during the lab time so you can use the lab computers and ask the ta questions
Yeah
chem had to do 10 pages in hs 💀
Same problem I had with English like I know *how* to use the words I'm using and I know they fit but if you ask me to define the words you lost me completely
You only have to write maybe 2 or 3 full lab reports during the semester, some labs will only have worksheets or a partial lab report
And physics labs meet every other week
Then you have a week to do the report
On a scale of difficulty what is Case physics compared to AP Physics?
Ap physics 1/2 or C
1 and C
C is tedious tbh
just computations
121 uses calculus, so it's very different to physics 1 (that's the equivalent of physics 115 at case)
i cannot understand it for the life of me
But I think it's easier in some ways and harder in others
Physics C is 121 I think
Yes it's technically equivalent
I personally thought 121 was really hard and 122 was pretty easy, but that's actually a very unpopular opinion
Most people think 121 is easier
121 has a really large curve for grading usually, so you can pass the class with a C if you manage a 35% in most years
💀
Then like a 60% for a B and an 80% for an A
yeah itâ€™s about right
But keep in mind that this curve has to exist to make the average score in the class a B
45-50 is a 5
The physics tests can be quite challenging though, imo they were very tricky conceptually
curved to about 70
75
80/20?
or is weight irrelevant?
classes out of 1000 points?
thatâ€™s actually lenient
I could be a bit off on these
But it was somewhere along those lines
Those both seem really good imo
somehow i got credit for phys mech
so hyped
Are there any classes where like your whole grade hinges on the final?
How do you define "whole grade" but sometimes yeah
is a non-morning schedule possible for first years or not?
What do you consider mornings
8-9
Best you can hope for is probably like a 10:30 start, and that's only if you skip calc 2
I would like to start my classes around 10-11
My earliest start my first semester was around then I believe
But I tested out of calc 2
anything before 10 is me being back on a hs schedule 💀
unfortunate
Wait fr my hs started at 7:25 am
yeah we started at 7:55
This was intro to modern physics and like an 80% was curved to an A, so it turned out alright lmao
My high school started at 7am lmao
Now I struggle to wake up for 9:30 classes
do you guys have a block of classes?
or is it speckled throughout the day?
You can make your schedule have blocks or not
It's up to you, especially after you get past chem/physics/calc hell
4-5?
15-17 credits
i know 6 is excessive
it says on the freshmen rec thing
that 12 is min and 19 is max
14-17 is rec
u have to take a min of 12 credits
All in, take the max credits, no regrets
so at least 4 classes
yea
15 credits a semester is what puts you on track to graduate in 4 years
well depends
some classes r 1 credit
some r 0
one of my classes is 3.75...
its so weird
😭
just manage ur time
HUH??
this is insane
It is now
30 credits???
he managed to pass them all????
nah my counselor said 19 is max
I'm pretty sure he skipped a lot of those classes
For freshman yes
But he still graduated with a pretty good GPA I think
After freshman year you have certain gpa thresholds to get overloads
I think he graduated like 6 years ago or smth
oh yea
For your first semester, but you can get permission to overload in later semesters if you exceed a certain GPA
ohh i see
i mean
what else is there to do there
@roguish_raven whats the most youâ€™ve taken in a semester?
oh thats important
completed
u have two weeks to drop and add classes too so
well depending on the class length
w for wow
I like having fun lol
connectionzzzzzz
for employment or whatever
all these class discussions are making me stressed
lol
go take a break
😔
wait off topic
whats yalls wpm
mine is
85
120 sum
WHAT
Mine is somewhere in the 60-80 wpm range
i mean dawg
ur cs
cs has
no life
If that's your personal dream, go ahead and follow it. But it's not good for you 😭
https://monkeytype.com/
go
You'll be fine. Seriously
cuz a lot of the time u will set urself to failure
it helps me that i have a hs alum in the same program as me
I did 6 hs classes and 10 credits at csu on top of it last semester, i loved it and hated it at the same time. The stress was probably not good for me like you said though
she said transition is pretty smooth for everyone

yea
on comp
Most people I know keep a 3.0+ gpa and have time for other commitments like a musical ensemble, a sports team, greek life, a more involved club, etc.
Chances are if you got into this school, you will be okay
okok

who knows
u might actually enjoy having a life lol
I thought you said 85 jeez
i just tested
Mobile typing is goofy lol
I'll try laptop later
wait i wanna try mobile
I personally do a lot of things at Case, but many of my friends think I stress myself out too much lol
im doing this 💀

Cs get degrees 😮â€💨
ah?
15-17 classes woah
Credits not classes lmao
15 classes and they're all one credit 😎
That sounds pretty fun
do you recommend aiming for high gpas?
like close to 4?
or is 3.6/3.7 sufficient?
Wdym
I would say aim for a 3.5
That's a good goal
But 3.0 is also okay, especially for engineering or cs
well also internships etc
and like experience
3.5 gpa is good enough in most majors to be competitive for jobs, internships, and grad school
3.0 is probably sufficient for engineering lol
is gpa from hs to college unweighted usually similar
What do you mean
Like the numbers?
At case A = 4.0, B = 3.0 and so on
so like i had a 4.0 in hs but am doing engineering with a pretty high credit load so i dont wanna be too harsh on myself
Then the weight each grade has on your gpa depends on what credits it was worth
ah okay
Especially at case lol
We are not known for grade inflation
If you're getting mostly As and Bs, you're doing well here :)
sweet
Nice
Maybe one friend
I was actually one of the longer holdouts lol
I kept a 4.0 for three semesters
And now I'm free
do you guys give A+'s?
No +s or -s
ah
A low B is worth the same as a high B
I think the law school might do + and -, but that's not relevant to any of you
so it goes by 10%s
Depends on the professor
I've had a good amount of professors who will give an A for an 88% or so
thatâ€™s nice of em
normally is 89.5+ for an A
And also hella curved classes that give out an A for 80% and a B for 60%
dang
But there's also professors who are very strict and wouldn't even round a 89.9
whatttt
😭
Professors put their grading policies in the syllabus, so make sure to read it
I take notes on paper
are majority of math/physics/chem classes curved?
I'm not sure
It depends on the professor
Iâ€™ve heard good things about stone and chisel
Typewriters too
More modern
Too modern*
notebooks it is
I recommend skinning a sheep and stretching it's skin to make parchment and then using linseed oil or a similar substance to make your own ink. Then of course find a good bird to take a good quill feather from
It's all the rage
None of these are explicitly changing the grade boundaries, but they might make it easier to get a higher grade
I'm not pulling them out of my ass
you can also use rice paper probably
Replacing a low midterm with your final score is the only reason i got an A in calc 1 and 2, i love that policy
I prefer notes I can eat
Yum. Calculus
oh im pretty sure theres also pens w edible ink
in theory u can write notes u can eat
Yeah, that was the policy in my DiffEq class iirc
True . . . Could also use sphaghettios
If anyone is curious, these were policies in linear algebra and scientific computing with prof Dobrosotskaya, DiffEq with prof zhao, number theory and geometry with prof singer, and something that prof zhao let us do in DiffEq one time when everyone bombed a quiz
In Julia's linear algebra she actually dropped the entire lower midterm score though 🥺 (a lot of people failed the first midterm, I think the median score was a 60%)
And that's. Pretty rough
That is such a nice thing to do
Julia Dobrosotskaya is sooo nice
She is my advisor and I love her
She can be a pretty tough professor, but she tries to make things as straightforward as possible and wants everyone to succeed
High level math courses are great breadth classes
Lol
If you are not looking for a character building experience, look elsewhere
Character building is my favorite
It's not easy stuff that's going to hand success to you on a silver platter. But if you put the work in, you will leave these classes a stronger and more dedicated student with a more useful skillset for the future
I just remember it and communicate it in the oral tradition smh
could u theoretically use fruit and veggies to write ur notes
Understandable, but I prefer ritualistic dance to express local history
@toojewforschool look what you've done

Oopsy I prefer writing a one act play for every lecture
But like
Atleast in the not so distant future
Discover be on some bs
Tell her itâ€™s good for you to build your credit
Yeah I'm considering just
Doing it myself once I get on campus
You should actually let your parents spend money on it
Let them handle the credit and payments
Yeah if you're 18 you can do whatever you want
While you use your debit they can build your credit for you
if thatâ€™s another reason you can convince them
I don't rly plan on using it at all besides for Uber small purchases
Like groceries if I ever buy groceries
Now that I think about it
got that weekend plum market egg sandwich to get me through :frogeheart:
Cause I was thinking about it and was like "wait am I going to have to learn how to cook for the weekends"
Id probably end up setting my dorm on fire
So
That's good for case
I think I know how to make chicken nuggets
If it's heat up food I can do it but if it requires a recipe yeah probably not
I'm probably gonna be home during breaks so that's fine
how long is freshmen orientation
1 week
Move in Sunday, orientation Monday-Friday pretty much. Maybe one more thing on Saturday? And then you just get to start class with everyone else
What type of stuff do you even do
oh is modern always like that
I have no idea, but that's what it was for me. It was with Monreal
Walk around campus, meet your 4 year advisor, go to mandatory seminars for things like sexual assault prevention training, learn about different organizations on campus, meet some of your peers and make some friends, and some CWRU traditions
That's all the stuff I remember
It's decently fun
More carefree than the rest of the semester at least lol
Yeah, I highly recommend going to all the stuff you can, itâ€™s a great way to meet new people and become acclimated to college
yeah still with monreal next sem. his rmp is pretty bad--would you say thats accurate or nah
I think people are being too harsh on rmp
I thought he was nice and he was a pretty entertaining/clear professor. The homeworks were challenging, but they weren't ridiculous, there was just usually one or two problems I needed some help to figure out an approach for
ah yeah that wouldnt help
thats good to hear though thanks
we had like one regular midterm and then one that i swear only jake knew how to do, and he said it was closer to a diffeq exam than a physics one
So the bar for success is not that high 😭
wow okay
Well my point was that they aren't like covaults exams, so you'll be fine lol
Idk chances are you're even more physics inclined than I am (I withdrew from classical mechanics) so you'll probably be more fine than me
And if you're not you have lots of friends who took 221 last year lmao
so true!!!
it tempts me sometimes
Lmao I was surprised by how many senior engineering majors take 221
is there a reason for that or are they just curious
It's required for aerospace engineering majors and it's a tech elective for about half of the others
At least that's how I imagine it
I believe its required for us mechE's too
Might be part of the new bulletin
Could be
it was either take that, stats or an intro bio class for polymers/materials. I chose the one I thought I'd do the best in lol
Praying they email me about housing today
Hopefully they do though
You can camp out in cutler 401 otherwise
Nice
Mostly digital, but depends on professor. Definitely more digital than high school
Like having a folder would be useful, but a binder for handouts is not necessary
i was suspicious that might happen to me lol
I like having folders for my classes
individual folders or like one accordion style one
ah okay
I like having a folder for each class- but I usually have a couple classes where I'll use it a lot and a couple where I barely use it at all
I'll plan for multiple folders then
Also, if you end up not using or barely using a folder, you can keep it for next semester
good point
I do that with my notebooks
everything cim music theory is paper based
also make sure to get a notebook of manuscript paper that has perforations so you can tear out pages for dictations
you have time to get these things when you get to case though
Thank you! I'll add that to the list
ik but if i get it now my parents will probably cover it lol
makes sense
what instrument?
alto sax primarily
~~have you considered marching band?~~
depending on what other instruments you play you should look at some of the other ensembles
i am a shill for the hpp (historical performance practice) ensembles because u get to play on historical instrument replicas
you are
im planning on it
for cad
yeah ive picked up on that thankfully
woo!
also play french horn, clarinet, and a little guitar
if u have a binder, manuscript paper,  a computer, and some writing utinsils you should be good
I used one of those big folders with hella dividers in them
Very ez to organize
like a binder with dividers or an actual folder
122 does
oh skyler beat me
me too
actual folder
with a zipper and allat
like an accordion folder?

like this
sweet
very convenient
yeah do what works best for you
I almost pulled up to management 201 with a typewriter once
Highkey he wouldâ€™ve gotten a good laugh out of that
My girlfriend TAs 201 lol
I have been to jolly with that man
gilmore would respect anyone who would lug a typewriter to class
Lol
yeah im rly hoping i get literally anything
within the first 6 months

(kidding, but seriously this a recurring thing in their field)
hey @bnkoeppen how much should i be worrying about the music theory placement test?
looking at the cwru page on handshake cwru really likes rockwell
i mean not too much
they're nearby and a bunch of cwru grads
Yeah but tis kinda funny how on the "great for internships" page of the career center
It solely lists Rockwell
lol

i know maj and min scales and stuff my sight singing is just not there
idk but if you know how to read music and your scales you should probably be fine
a decent amount of people are in 101i anyways even at cim
ah dang
im hoping to avoid 101i with my crazy schedule
when do ap scores come out again
is it midnight today (pst)
Sometime on July 8th
You'll know because all of the people your age will start blowing up social media
And you'll get an email
(theyre out)
@eekhannah ayoooooo
hello
myhealthconnect
can you show me what youâ€™re looking at? obvi without personal info
of course! i figured out the privacy notice so only the medical release is giving issues now 🙂 i'll send screenshots in a sec
LOL no worries
ok so this is what comes up when i click on the minor medical release form update button
funky
this pops up when i click for details
what tab is this under
glad it's not just me who's confused on this  😭
medical clearances
the consent forms tab just says my name and "No consent forms to display"
and the downloadable forms tab gives me a medical record request form, a ROI, and two rabies declination statements
hmm i guess it makes the most sense to just email and see if they link it to me but thanks anyway!!
yes that would be a good idea
yeah thanks again, don't worry about it 😭 i'm sure i'll figure it out
https://i.imgur.com/segNsf4.png
atleast nothing that comes to mind when asked so vague a question as "describe software skills"
"prospective position" ANYTHING?
Do you know how to code or program in a language? Can you use 3d modelling software? How about Microsoft office? Google suite?
Fr

CELEBRATE???
Judging by the overall theme and stuff it's clearly positive but celebrate was not the right word here I don't think
https://i.imgur.com/SH3UnnS.png
billion dollar uni btw
https://i.imgur.com/JnZZf2Q.png
....
i noticed that lol
lmao
Really high tier stuff
Also I hope everyone who got ap results today did well! :)
why
Research labs
wait until you get on campus is my advice
send 8-10 emails per fleet of emails
it took about 20 emails for me to land a paid position, but a decent number of people were also willing to offer me an unpaid one
itâ€™s not something to worry about right now, wait until youâ€™re on campus at least
plenty of people i know didnâ€™t start doing research until their sophomore or junior years, and i wouldnâ€™t even try to start first semester. maybe send emails to start second semester but take first semester to adjust and figure out what you like first
bc youâ€™ll sound a lot more appealing to PIs if you know what youâ€™re talking about and what youâ€™re interested in
depends on the pi
in my experience most PIs that i have been in contact with do not pay undergrads, but my current lab position is paid. but it also varies by department
a good hack (for the cleveland clinic only, so for health sciences people) is to see if undergrads are listed on the lab website. if theyâ€™re listed on the lab website, the PI pays their undergrads and so if you want a paid position, look for a (cleveland clinic) lab where the undergrads are listed
for case labs you do just have to ask them
do source!!
you have to find a lab first
and if you have a PI that pays you can get paid with both
and also yeah i think the chances of being paid over the summer are higher
what exactly is source
https://case.edu/studentlife/ugresearch/find-programs-and-funding/undergraduate-research-office-funded-programs
Additionally some PIs will find non-SOURCE funding for undergrads but that varies wildly by department and by PI.
Ex: my PI is paying me for the month of August I have me in the lab and to help him with some new grad students
good to know
like 50% of applicants get it
Anyone recommend bringing vacuum, or broom+mop for dorms?
Vacuum is nice
are there any difference between getting AIQS in spring and fall?
It determines what semester you take your aiqs class in
Basically just if you need to plan for one during fall or spring course registration
okay thanks
Best cranial nerve mnemonic?
if you live in clarke you have carpet
so just a vacuum
Cedar mag also has carpet I think
Maybe I'm going crazy but I'm pretty sure Cutler did
Okay Cutler definitely goes
*does
It's thin carpet, but definitely carpet
maybe just get a swiffer/vacuum once you get to case and see whether your room is carpeter or not tbh
yeah i think the community offices have them
itâ€™s nice to have a handheld vacuum tho
definitely donâ€™t buy a full size one
It happens to all of them eventually, so I'm told
New server gets created for the new class and i assume everyone just moves to that one
i was about to say the same
i have a discord servers for my friend groups 🙏🙏
Same
Lmao
Bros graduated
At least most of them
A decent amount of people stay at case for an extra semester or two due to factors like co-op, major changes, gap semesters, or integrated masters
I know people who've done that for all of those separate reasons
not graduating in 4 years is fairly common in general
CWRU had 69% 4 year graduation rate and 84% 5 year rate
Which means about 15% of people graduate after 4 but by 5 years
Anyone here a transfer student?
like what
only one i know of is sidechat
but thats apple exclusive :joedisgust:
Lots of discord servers but there's also GroupMe
bingo
what are you referring to
Groupme
not that the two are exclusive
merit
does fafsa cover a fifth year?
and do grants stop after the fourth?
6 yrs
A lot of 5th year graduations are produced by taking a semester off for a co-op or as a break from university, and those semesters are not paid for
Many people who graduate in 4.5 or 5 years will still only have 8 semesters worth of classes
so we can save our eligibility by taking a semester off / co-op etc?
what yrs do people normally take their breaks? iâ€™m assuming 3rd or 4th year?
Usually junior year for co-ops
I see I see
thoughts on prof RenÃ©e Sentilles
please tell me there not required
Definitely not
good
But that implies I'll actually get one
i feel like they can only be a good thing
There are plenty of valid reasons to not be interested in doing a co-op
One of my fraternity brothers had to take one class at case while he was co-op to be able to graduate in 8 full time semesters
yeahh especially with all of the complexity going on with my majors
Yeah, I think music is kind of front loaded though
With theory and history
the very very rough four-year plan I made was super front heavy
Music is front loaded but engineering is just loaded
I think what helped Ben (music/cs) was that music is front loaded and cs is back loaded
There are certain classes you will just have to take in your first semesters to finish both meche and music
yeah
My Hope is I might be able to take music history classes as a junior or senior instead but we'll see
The problem is that they're prerequisites for other music classes
Like the upper electives iirc
ah shoot really?
Well, if you're interested in electives that have to do with music history
Ben would know more about this
You should look at the list of music courses to see their pre-reqs
hmm okay
I'll see what i can do
might make a spreadsheet in combination with stellic to get it really solid
Good luck Lydia
i'm trying to make a course schedule via stellic but I think it's shoving a lot of my ap credits as classes that I should take in fall 2024, is thre a way to remove this or mark it as complete?
Just remove them
hey @tazmania40 do you guys do away stuff for marching band or just home games?
sweet okay
King Koeppen saving music/stem majors 🙏
srsly dude youre saving my but
also on the full time grind so i get it
yeahh people are probably tired of all of the specific questions haha
this is mostly because i am doing it the dumb way by getting a BS in compsci
what would the not dumb way be?
BA compsci with BA music
way less requirements
ah yeah
currently i think im doing a BS in ME  and a BA in music
The Koeppen Method
yeahh
there is so much wind in cleveland rn
im watching the lamp post outside my window sway
Denver stays winning smh
beryl is hitting here i think
i was pointing and laughing at my newly texan boyfriend sunday, now i am the clown
Aw no itâ€™s cute
Iâ€™m about to be long distance and ppl r so negative ab it like calm down
If it works it works if ot doesnâ€™t itâ€™s okay
yeah.. the amount of people that were like "what are you going to do when he moves to texas" ?? live my life?
THATS WHAT IM SAYYYINGGG
weve been together since the beginning of my sophomore year and his junior year (of college) so lol
Thatâ€™s so cute
Did he also go to cwru
yeah
He must be a good man
u know it
in my head heâ€™s coming back to cwru next semesterâ€¦
Assuming Iâ€™m thinking of the right person, he had better come back to visit
i think youâ€™re thinking of the right person
you share a name
Good
He and I sang at Jolly Karaoke together
Good times
i know
so it would be weird to ask for time off now
Yeah that checks out
but heâ€™ll at least be here for my graduationâ€¦ i think. i hope
WHAT.
Why
are you aware of his employer
||Thereâ€™s no chance you were watching me embarrass myself singing up there???||
no i was not there but there is a video somewhere in my email
or doing my physics lab
wait whats he doing for those of us unaware of his employer
Oh thatâ€™s right I remember that email
no one say it publicly
iâ€™ll dm
he's a very cool guy
youâ€™ve received a dm
i think so too
😭
weâ€™ve been together for soooo long
but it makes sense now that i've interacted with both of you more
see itâ€™s so funny
to see people who know us separately get so confused
it was very unsettling initially because I know you both from very different contexts
i hear that from people a lot
my little knew us both from different contexts and suddenly they knew him from two places and that was silly
when did you learn we were dating 😭
weirdly I think through a certain fraternity brother of mine offhandedly mentioning it?
~~trying not to dox but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't care~~
he said, and i quote â€œI think Iâ€™ll be able to put up with it for a couple yearsâ€
east coast beast coast
That makes sense, 
I mean its got good name recognition, if he can put up with a year or so there it will probably open doors to many other places
so true
Nuh uh
yuh huh
Are you from the East Coast? If not, you do not have experience to say so, therefore invalid. If so, you are biased and therefore invalid.
Checkmate 😎
Guys why fight over the east and west coast when we have the best coast here: the north coast, cleveland is such a great city to live in (iâ€™ve been trapped here for 18 years and canâ€™t wait to leave after the next 4 are over)
As this glass that so helpful came with my apartment points out really Midwest is best.
~~why did you choose to stay then~~
Full ride
ah
tbh i do love cleveland
I also love cleveland a lot
and tbh may actually end up here for grad school
Move to California (you know you want nice weather after living in Ohio)
unless UC Davis gives me an amazing PhD offer I can't refuse /ref
i just wanna live in a new city tbh
spent 4 years here. wanna branch out make new connections
i wouldnâ€™t mind staying here i would just prefer a new experience bc thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about
I mean i do like it here, it will always have a place in my heart, but i also know i'd go crazy if I stay here forever
join us
you should move to providence
i think providence is underrated
itâ€™s like boston but cheaper, more car friendly, less crowded, and with better food
I would like to be somewhere with good universities for grad school / academia purposes
🟫
yes 🟫
Well best of luck
pls let me in so i can keep my good credit score 🙏🙏
iâ€™m so stressed rn bro
Oh nice
So real 😔
The Clayton Experience
My favorite university! Square Emoji
The Emoji movie shouldâ€™ve made that joke
Have the poop emoji guy say â€œAh yes, I graduated number two of my class at Square Emoji Universityâ€ and show the brown square. Itâ€™s a triple entendre joke
They should hire you to make the emoji movie 2
there's a nonzero chance I basically do what Clayton did lol
typically recommended for neuroscience majors to start by second semester of junior year
You could join that one psychologist associated with the school in the hall of cwru-people-who-shaped-childrens-movies hall of fame
Solid point
Iâ€™m telling you I could make the Emoji Movie much better
I believe in ya
yes but foith could achieve greatness
make a true masterpiece
absolutely
cant wait lol
Gonna pump out the script and show greatness 😎
bc i emailed a few ppl butr no replies
so im like how dod everyone else get it
ur literally fine
dw
Bleessss
i was in a different lab in the fall semester
itâ€™s so easy to research imposter syndrome at cwru bc everyone does research but you have to remember that it isnâ€™t this way at other universities
because iâ€™ve had to justify my knowledge and experience to every PI iâ€™ve spoken to
yes, but that is compared to a senior
the prime time to get research is sophomore or junior year
because itâ€™s a waste of time
covault tends to be the first lab a lot of physics ppl are in so maybe hes more open to underclassmen/freshmen than most
im sure it varies by pi
yeah fr
and by department
oh im sure
its the biggest major in cas?
bigger than like bio?
technically
because biology is split into ba and bs
so itâ€™s two separate majors
ah
if you combined them biology is larger
also had no idea that most bio ppl are bas
learnign a lot in this convo
or like 150 ba
talk to zeke about this its fucked up
Why's it fucked up?
I know people who were
HOW
like fall semester?
That is heard of but rare
I know a couple people who got research as a freshman, but most people I know did not
And premed stuff, but this is just an impression of mine
The people I know who got research as a freshman were mostly in smaller departments
ok yes makes snese
Lmaooooo yeah
LMAO how do you know if it;s scuffed
she more or less told me so
The norms in different departments for research are very different
tbh i wasnâ€™t sure she took undergrads at all but she was super nice when she met with me which was cool, but it seemed like she sorta threw something random together that seemed plausibly at an undergrad level
thanks to my summer work iâ€™m very familiar with what it feels like when someone gives you a research project with insufficient support and youâ€™ll be flailing, and i was getting that sense
Lmao I've been doing the first three, it's a grindset. We'll see how adding research fares next semester (if I can ever get into it)
Hopefully bruh
Im premed.. should I be emailing bio professors asking for research 😬
Try talking to them in person
Honestly, wait until you get to campus lol
Yes most professors are not looking for new lab undergrads over the summer
bless thank you
Relationships sink so much time lmao 😭
And neuroscience? Dawg 💀
ahhhh i see i see
while taking physics 2 💀
so real
he was doing his capstone too 😭 so we were fighting for time together
Lmao same
And now he has to get a real job 😭
bc it had to do with the eclipse
so he had a very involved capstone project
Ohh yeah eclipse grindset for radio people
time management is key
One of these is not like the others
oh just a shitty mentor going on 3 years now but i get payed so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
yes but he is a time commitment none the less
yeah i agree
You fool
Good luck, that sounds rough
But also by reading Zhuangzi
Also even so my statement then becomes that romance is a distraction from living life
I disagree
Well I'd hope so, I'm not speaking earnestly
and iâ€™m just a social media chair for my club
\:-(
Î£Î¨?
yeah lol
Oof, unfortunate
Sps
Lmao, Greek life is definitely a big time commitment for me
But it's fun
Sigma Psi is no more, rough stuff
Yeah I know, I was asking which sorority
who said that not me
tri sigma is definitely going to do better without us around
Said what? Huh? Who?
love my tri sigmas
Ha.
i deleted a message
I am kidding
Lots of bids to the same people?
Only a little, I mostly enjoy it
yes
we had the same demographic
I would hope so
most of their formal class was with us on day 4 of formal
What if Î˜Î¥
Yeah I can see how formal leads to more bid-crossover
Lmao, hopefully not gonna happen
Maybe you two could have merged into Î£Î£Î£Î¨
LOL
technically members of sig psi are eligible to rush next sem
bc we were non panhel
Theta Chi and Delta Upsilon have a little bit of demographic crossover, but honestly not as much as some people think we do. I would say we get an average of 1-2 cross bids per year
Interesting, I wonder how many people actually will
why?
i thought about it but i have so much on my plate next semester
Yeah, but then we donâ€™t have to deal with our international
iâ€™m p sure cwru banned new local chapters from forming
so
Yeah very understandable
bruh
So beta nu may not be happening lol
Not that it was likely to anyway
Yeah lol, just bully your international into being cooler
this slowly happens with literally every intl greek org
Or they implement something like 72 hour rush or the like
Lmao yeah, every year they drift closer to being inoffensive nerds like us
Survival of the safest
If anything the next thing CWRU will do is introduce month long rush 😭
I think we're one of the only schools to have a 3 week rush
I don't think anyone would enjoy month long rush lol
yeah but especially because it runs into some people's first midterms at that point
Yeah lol
It stretches small chapters pretty thin as it is
Because I know some are doing this
At case? Or somewhere else
Or are you talking about the zbt instant initiation thing
Yes that
Either way itâ€™s dum dum
I believe it happens almost immediately after bid day
💀
I hear itâ€™s partly to avoid hazing
But then you have â€œnew membersâ€ (pledges) in a multi-tier brother system who get hazed anyway
When I met guys from other DU chapters in Jamaica a lot of them have very large chapters and very short rush periods, and some even give out bids the first day they meet someone. They said that a lot of it comes down to the immediate vibes and energy they get from someone upon meeting them, and that they get a good idea of how to read people's fit with the chapter very quickly
Man you know it's so easy to just not haze people
4.7 cu ft is enough for two people together eho have meal plans
theyâ€™re massive we been seeing them
you will regret bringing it if you do. consider that everything you move inâ€¦ you must move out
Yes but
Also
baddie you have a dining hall
there are late night options
😭
no
theyâ€™re on the meal plan
Fr
Ah alright
I wonder if I should be concerned
😭
Freshman 15 incoming
den is overrated tbh
i went like 4 times all year
What a nice day here
113 what the hell
https://i.imgur.com/umGRjSH.png
closest we get to that is 99
same
somehow
I gained weight
I got the freshman 0.2
put some siracha in that jawn it hits
yeah me too
Den was good but at a certain point you just realize all of their stuff's somehow drowning in grease
even the sandwiches
with all of my heart
in an ideal world i eat breakfast
in terms of waking up
i mean it depends on how you handle mornings tbh
but if you naturally wake up early and have no desire to sleep later etc then youre prob fine
if thereâ€™s another option i would personally pick something else
if itâ€™s not itâ€™s not too big of a deal
going to bed earlier
Lol same
When I went home for the summer after freshman year I was so excited to eat good food again I prolly overdid it a little, but I don't really care
turkey blt was fire
I always got either that or the den burger and the chicken tenders
itâ€™s also growing up
like yes ofc i weigh more at 21 than i did when i was 16
i am an adult
Puberty pt. 2
yes
Puberty does not end when you finish high school
so true
Hopefully mine will continue until I can look my age 😭
People still mistake me for a high schooler all the time
I literally looked like I was nine years old until I was fifteen
â˜¹
yes
bro
Lmao
As a whole
LMAO
One of my friends told me how he was at the pool with his cousins and they told him he had to be "14 or take a swim test" to be able to swim in the pool
He showed them his id proving he was 20 and the lifeguard was like "you expect me to believe this fake?"
yeah
like people usually mistook me for 2 years younger than i am
when i was 19 people thought i was 17
True. I'm also more unusually short than you are
I think
I don't remember your height besides that you're shorter than me
iâ€™m 3 inches below average for an adult woman
5â€™1
I am 5 inches below average for an adult (American) man at 5'4
I'm sometimes the shortest person in the room but not that often
Guys around 5'4 are uncommon but I do know several
Only took 6 weeks but finally got my transfer credits
Huge
Wait since when is calc 3 four credits
Boss move
Was it 4 credits at CSU?
Yes
They're probably giving you the credits you earned there based on the time in took in that case
I would say unlikely to be a clerical error
Either way, just happy to have the credit for the class
So true! DiffEq time
You should take abstract algebra next semester >:)
Mostly kidding
I think you could also take intro to analysis. Real trial by fire for the math major lmao
Unless you see a rare elective that you're really interested in
Real analysis is all proofs though
Linear algebra is better because itâ€™s a smoother introduction to proofs
Discrete or linear are good 300 levels to ease into it, abstract or real are not as good
Yeah im doing diff eq this semester and probably linear next semester
If you're into cryptography it could be a good choice
I had fun in number theory at least lol
Avalon is a hater number theory is ezpz
oh wait math major nvm
Ive considered it but not this semester atleast, im looking forward to diff eq
if you take number theory then discrete will be snoozefest for a lot of it
Number theory is offered every fall I think, probably easier to get into as at least a sophomore
you do some number theory stuff, some graph theory, some combinatorics, etc
Interesting
So taking both would just be redundant in a way?
Number theory goes into a lot of topics that are pretty important for getting a good grounding in cryptography and idk if discrete is the same way
Does discrete do elliptic curves, chinese remainer theorem, and modulo arithmetic?
> Topics introduced are mathematical reasoning, Boolean connectives, deduction, mathematical induction, sets, functions and relations, algorithms, graphs, combinatorial reasoning
from the syllabus
It is and its already full so Iâ€™ll consider it for sophomore year
(Do not do this)
Do that? Bet
Lmao. Also add in math 324 and 330
"... do this ..." - Adam Hutchings
To round out the experience
the important part is knowing graph stuff and how to write a proof at all for algorithms
which is why its a prereq
Quick, is 3,411,073 prime mod 17?
3411073 iff 341109 iff 34116 iff 3415 so no
Wait, PRIME mod 17?! Shoot
I did not take number theory
I read it as divisible mod 17 nvm
Yeah I know lol I'm just messing with you
Another fun part of number theory is figuring out how many divisors a number has
And crypto spring 2025 maybe 🙏
And the only ones we had in the same semester were DiffEq and physics 1 and 2
Outside of calc 3
Hopefully it'll work out
What are those ones?
(Topology and algebraic topology respectively)
But topology might be fun
Ew stats -stats hater
Yes
Why
It's useful
Tbh I have no idea if I think stats will be fun or not
I need to learn some R
I think classes like number theory, geometry, and crypto are fun, but idk if that's really a cohesive preference
^
Avalon definitely has very unique opinions on good courses
its at the same time as ai
It is overfull
Iâ€™m so excited for info theory ngl
Plus everything else with only one section
The illusion of free will
Oof yeah that's a rough timeslot to be locked out of
i managed to get in thankfully
or the ever crowded 10:35-11:25 mwf or whatever it is
At least for geology like every class is offered every other year so none of them can conflict with each other lol
Also a much smaller department
i was always on the fence about it so i never had it in my name, last semester i decided to just go with it and drop it if i felt like later lmao
Oh neat see you in 308 with Juan then
It's very ta dependent
Kind of yeah
i think 3 or 4 classes i need to take before i graduate are scheduled this way in the fall
If you want to get into stat 312 as an underclassmen you have to use a workaround called "get a senior to hold the class for you and then drop it at the same time you try to add it"
But honestly, just wait. It's not that deep
this is what i did to get song as a first semester junior
Tbh
yeah
Yeah lmao it's brutal out here
Hopefully I'll be able to get a decent prof for it in the spring but who knows lmao
i love that woman
ah i was gonna ask how are the good profs but is it good prof singular and its song?
iâ€™ve heard mixed reviews
song is a good prof and easy is the difference
got it
who should i avoid
uhh
mondal
rate my professor is very true for the stat 312 professors
good to know ty
and also the professor determines how much R you use
like nandy uses way more than song
ah
I think 312 teaches R to some extent? But I'm not sure
itâ€™s a cross listing
the professors do not adjust how they teach you if youâ€™re 312 or 312R
is nandy more r focused?
Bro the new dorms look so nice
https://case.edu/housing/facilities/second-year-buildings/noyes-house
They added photos
Finally wood floors bro I hated the gross tiles
permanently raging about proper bathroom sinks after i had these all year
😭😭😭
theyre the right height for like a fourth grader
Thatâ€™s crazy
storrs grindset 🤩
although in all fairness the sinks are my only real complaint about the dorm
My complaint was the floor
the window is nice tho
nice natural light
Yes I love floor to ceiling windows
So pretty
And I have 2 windows so Iâ€™m excited
it was so nice
The combined shower toilet stall is definitely a choice, but other then that it looks really good

Oh my god
this is only in the fourth floor corner rooms of greek houses on top of the hill
so there are like 16 of these rooms that exist total
I asked housing if they could send me a picture of my dorm bc I have an ADA one so idfk what itâ€™s gonna look like based off the photos on the website
So hopefully they show me
I have a kitchen so I wanna see what itâ€™s like
it was so good for napping in the sun
I hope the shower is better than the one I had last year
I loveeee that
I hope my kitchen has a dishwasher
i love my dishwasher so much this summer
Same
with no dishwasher
me when i had a 3/10 chance of getting stj over village and i got stj
Iâ€™m figuring with housing bc they put me in the most expensive housing option possible
FINALLY
Like literally I am the only one with one this expensive
I KNOW WHERE IM GOING TO LIVE
$7650 a semester 😭😭😭
ew
my housing is free âœ¨âœ¨
(iâ€™m an RA)
dam
Ya I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s an option for me
my housing is free too kind of maybe technically
im paying $0 until i graduate
:trollface:
LMFAO
For just this semester
thought that would b me and then my parentsâ€™ financial situation drastically changed
(in the eyes of the university)
I have no idea how my financial aid is gonna look
Like they only care about the view that gives them the most money
lowkey
when it's snowy in December
when it gets dark at like 5 pm
Case is depressing asf but also like it's such a vibe
Like thank you financial aid office
Lol wait till you hear about Greek life's beef with housing
Vern's fault
would you all say cutler is good
All him
if you know
No
But all the dorms r kinda shit so itâ€™s fine
^
none of the freshman dorms are gonna be actually good
Did you get your gih?
I found it perfectly cromulent
That is to say, it was fine
No big complaints. Besides the creaky elevator
It's pretty old and tends to make you feel nervous at first
But it's actually fine
so
i imagine so
I think 417 is in the gih suite iirc
Yeah thatâ€™s crazy
they 0 care though
Yeah
I appealed 4x
The 4th time they gave me a $4600 university loan
so my parents income in 2022 is artificially 20k higher
and is overall 35k higher than their 2023 income
so letâ€™s hope 🙏🙏 when i send them 2023 theyâ€™ll be like ok more money
I have no clue how itâ€™ll effect finals
Finaid
and estimated income for 2024 is even lower than that
They changed fafsa lol
They changed the FAFSA to exclude that? That's fucked up
Yes
Like r u fr 😭😭
They expect my parents to pay $55k for me and $65k for my sibling
Like ??????
But who fucking knows
i thikn we're gonna be neighbors
4th floor Cutler was fun when I lived there
We put up a bunch of pride flags with rick astleys face on them
Among other things
Like itâ€™s 2am on a Tuesday night pls walk 20 steps to the common room
That's pretty weird lol
Or at least thatâ€™s why I think they would be in the hallway
does this mean my housing is $10,670 every year
so hypothetically do you tape the face to the flag or was it a custom one
Tape
Freshman housing is basically the cheapest
I'll see if I can get one from a different friend from Cutler 4
that is truly unfortunate, but I think I can get idea
wait how do you find who your roommate is
it says it in myhousing
for me
It might be in the housing portal? I don't remember
like
which part
Log into the housing portal, click on my assignment and then click on one of the two semester and scroll down
Contact info should be there too
mmmm
i think
click on "my assignments"
then select the term
yeah
and it will say roommate under it
https://i.imgur.com/azcUVuy.png
theres no roommate section
financial stuff
cus the award i accepted had like 10,812
Iâ€™m ngl itâ€™s better to have one now than to get used to not having a roommate and them randomly putting a roommate in ur room
Bc they will do that
i mean i am used to having roommates
its just preferable not to
cus ive done college programs like 3 times where i had to have roommates
Yeah itâ€™s veryyyy unlikely unless u specifically get a single room
Bc spring admits r a thing
ah okok
did you guys get free mini fridges
upperclassmen i mean
It's a new thing I think
Hah
No
For some reason the no took too long to send
Can I has mini fridge? 👉 👈
Actually
Unironically yeah, sure
Yeah if it's just for freshmen
LET'S GO
I'll keep mine stored up
And bring it next year
Unless I drop out somehow
If you plan to take the amount of classes required for the bs anyway you might as well
It can also qualify you for other scholarships
Some people feel that the bs gives them a stronger foundation and better grounding in skills
Skillset is more important than degree title when it comes to getting a job, but some jobs will see a BA as less impressive than a BS
Well theyâ€™re separate majors
Two BS degrees is going to be a lot of classes, even with a reasonable level of overlap
Is it possible to do both BS? Yes. But I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really sure you want to
Besides some extra electives and analysis
Lmao
My upperclassmen years will be more geology heavy lol
Question
Graduate on time
# ***__OR__***!
Funny math class is totally the better option
Hold on I have to find a relevant SIS page
Every 4 years???
Like find a group of people who are willing to commit to taking it
To justify running the class before you graduate
Also what might be hilarious would be me needing to take intro bio and gen chem lab in senior year
chat is water wet
Only if it's with other water
Well, looks like it's speeding up
7 1/2 year gap, then 4 year gap, then 3 ...
At this rate by 2040 it'll be offered every day
Welllll
David Singer is teaching it
And wait if it's offered next semester can't you just take it then?
I love Singer
â€œThe question "Is water wet?" can be answered from different perspectives:

Common Usage Perspective: In everyday language, "wet" describes something that has water on its surface. Since water is inherently present on itself, by this common usage, water can be considered wet.

Scientific Perspective: Scientifically, "wet" describes the state of being covered or saturated with a liquid. Water itself is a liquid and does not become covered with itself in the same way other materials do. So, from a scientific standpoint, water is not wet; it makes other things wet.

The debate hinges on the definition of "wet," but generally, in common language, people would say water is wetâ€ -chat(gpt)
Thanks AlexGPT
Yeah that's what I meant lol
\:-))))))))
Actually yeah why would you have to delay graduation for it
I just needed to select a funny math class 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
WAIT
I know a funnier one
In general I would prioritize on time graduation over many other things
At least in terms of not paying for a 9th semester of coursework
Because. Expensive
Wait actually I think graph theory had a time of over a decade between offerings 😔
Or do a masters
The problem you run into with attempting early graduation is hitting the requirement of 120 credits to graduate
Unless you come in with like 30 credits
Wouldnt be insane
If you're going into industry then getting a BS/MS is cool
Do they do BA/MS, just curious
However, grad schools often expect applicants with a master's to have correspondingly more coursework/research experience
I think they do
I know there's igs for ba/ma
I feel like i read it somewhere that you can ba/ms or bs/ma
cwru actually isnt currently accepting applications for any graduate astronomy program! fun fact
Ah nice they've now changed it such that bs can go to ma and ba can go to Ms
whats the difference between an ma and an ms
Masters of art and masters of science
Usually different subjects
ah that makes sense
You could try going to whoever's teaching it in person before the semester starts and asking them if they would let you in (especially because you're a math major)
Do you want to share the email?
Also, I promise that even if you don't take 227 you'll be fine
(Also @michael_cjr I checked and Juan Orendain is one of the professors offering Calc III, he is *so* nice and I give it a legit 80% chance he will say yes if you go ask him in person, his office is in the basement of the math building)

This is from my request in SIS
I honestly would, but I'm nowhere near campus right now - is he decent with emails, or should I wait until Discovery week?
Did you meet the requirements outlined in this email some people got? https://discord.com/channels/1198835515911327934/1198836076274528367/1261129633307295825
He is also probably nowhere near campus lmao
Yeah, I got a 5 on calc BC
Because that's what's now outlined as a clear qualifier
Wait for a response then lol
It may take some time
Theyâ€™ll respond in time. Itâ€™s their summer too tho so give them grace
Yep, thanks all for talking me down from the ledge
Also, chances are it is not that serious. There is no guarantee that 227 will be an amazingly better class vs 223
Yeah. No job is going to look at you in 6 years like, "and on your transcript it says you took the non-enhanced version of calculus three, can you explain that?"
LMAO Charlie and I sent the same idea of a message within a second of each other
Mathematical minds think alike
Been friends too long
Ah damnit, better drop out now
Yeah I mean it's basically joever
Only because you were both trained in 227 and not 223 smh
!!!
Lmao
Community college might be a better option for me
Honestly, just go to trade school at this point
We'll always need plumbers
Plumbers make bank
Also, for the record, my experience in 224 was better than Adam's in 228 iirc
Imagine manual labor, but it's doing integrals and making approximations
The only number you need is the amount of caulk in pounds
Perhaps
Clocking in at the wolfram alpha mines
At least your professor knew the material
Thatâ€™s true
Manual labor but it's just chains of trig sub
Buuuuut I hear he is also a jerk
Who did you have Jake?
The factory plotting graphs on desmos, by hand
I got Gurarieâ€™d
Oh yeah @cawu can you tell us about Gurarie
@mw8900 where from Jersey?
north jerz
wbu
Yeah im happy gurarie isnt the diff eq prof this semester
Also ask rc rn yrnt cause he was there too
But rc rn yrnt is not in this server \:-(
Yeah. Meckes saved me the next sem when I took his class lmao
Invite 🥺
Same
County?
morris
Passaic
I used to go to the Crumbl in morris plains until a closer one opened
thats like 30 mins away from me i think lol
Do you fence or nah?
nope lol
Thats how I know the morris schools
idrk any schools outside my county tbh
Haha silly guy
Whats CWRU?
what is case western
Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit!!!
Ooooo that sounds fun
What trade are you learning?
im actually here rn!
Then we have to refine them, do some substitutions, and then integrate them and ship them off with their plus Cs

I'm personally looking for more qbits in these hills so that I can crack rsa crypto, gotta mine millions of these things
Coughing derivatives

Did you know that I know every digit in pi
Here:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and of course 0
WOAH
I'm stealing that btw
thatâ€™s crazy
The matrices are the monsters of legend rumored to roam the mines deepest levels
Oh you sweet summer child
The matrices are only the third level of the mines
Actually, even deeper, there are the mythical *Tensors*
You have not gotten down to the level of differential forms and L^2 spaces
Not to speak of abelian groups or *schemes*
This is why Iâ€™ll stick to my nursing stats 101 and call it a day
You're not ready for elliptic curves and kepler poinsot solids
Where philosophy majors learn their secrets
The philosophy mines are just full of new questions to ask
The caves of algebraic topology
Trembling even thinking about it
Running already
That definitely sounds like an eldrich horror
Okay I think we need an uncanny Mr. Incredible meme
On it
LETâ€™S GO
Or an iceberg meme
I remember I made an Indo-European linguistics iceberg meme that legitimately would take me hours to explain
I love iceberg memes and seeing even one thing I know like three levels down
I think that's the nerdiest thing I've ever read

You'll soon be reaching new depths
And I take that as a high compliment
The indo-european language family is kinda awesome ngl
My first language is proto-indo-european

Pythagorean theorem at the top layer

Field extensions, differential forms, groups/rings/fields, fundamental group, homotopy, chain complexes, (co)homologies, manifolds, categories, finite simple groups, stacks, schemes, semirings, magmas, nonmeasurable sets, fuzzy logic/sets, ideals, contour integrals, dual spaces, calculus of variations, measure theory
dude i do the same thing iâ€™m gonna be goated by next valentineâ€™s day lmao
That's a start at least
Lots of algebra and a smattering of other things
Are you taking abstract or something, or are you just going to hear "finite simple group" a lot
no i will not be taking abstract
Euclidean geometry also on top layer. Chinese remainder theorem, Fermat's little theorem, and Euler's formula can go on like the second or third layer
does the four color theorem go on there somewhere
And quadratic formula on top layer
Hyperbolic and spherical geometry can live on the second or third layer as well
2nd layer
Spherical 2nd, hyperbolic 3rd?
What do you think
Idk what people tend to learn first
So yeah
I said that because spherical geometry is "more intuitive"
Literally same mind
The Adam/Charlie hivemind is too real
Schlegel diagrams should be on the third layer
people with good intuitions fascinate me
One sec

yeah my physics intuition runs out about halfway through mech so uh
once again glad i didnâ€™t take 124
a, d
True, however I think you might be at a loss as to the true meaning of this image
Alright that's it I'm deleting this server
phys 124 is only offered in the spring if thatâ€™s the one you mean
booo column vectors

oh meant 123

Alright this is where I'm at so far
I might be overestimating all of these in terms of how high in the iceberg they are
Feel free to move some of these down by 2 or three layers
I have heard of 8
Also for the record 1729 is a sum of 2 cubes thing, eg. Taxicab numbers from ramanujan
Sum of three cubes is just related
So about half. And you're a math major too . . . I definitely overestimated these in terms of iceberg layers LMAO
I believe my masterpiece is complete
Michael mark my words
In two years I will ping you to revisit this message
And you can gaze upon thy iceberg from the heavens

@toojewforschool

I take 1 look at the cwru subreddit and every single post is a schedule check
Its funny to look at

Was going to craft an obsurd schedule and post it on the reddit but i guess not
If i fix sis for them can i just get my cs degree
Alex
I believe in some capacity, projects which â€œfix SISâ€ are banned from CS senior projects
Because everyone did them
Actually? Lmao
😔
CS senior capstones be like: so we made an app
banned an easy stratâ˜¹ï¸
Astronomy senior capstone: so we made a telescope
Chemistry senior capstone: so we made an isotope
Oh I thought it was because it was embarrassing for the university or everyone did it or both
sis is oracle peoplesoft
as shitty as it is they technically maintain it
and do what they can to keep them in
itâ€™s sso thatâ€™s down
not just sis
This fits most majors but ik CS should have a separate section to note your own projects so make sure you add it if ur CS
Thanks Oscar
Boss move
Dang dude
Bro Iâ€™ve deadass seen a resume that has like 4 colors, a crazy font and is laid out like a restaurant menu and it was on display on their LinkedIn 😭😭
Have you seen the guy that has the MLP resume? But heâ€™s a CS legend?
For reference
I mean who would hire mr bronie
He gave a Ted talk and everything
But seriously congrats bro
Congrats on what dawg
lol i need a CV
For CV you just gotta have a base template and just swap things like company names
Whoever came up w a cv deserves to have both sides of their pillows be hot on the driest and hottest of summer nights
for CV you need a lot of other stuff
CV is basically just like freestyling
CV is dumb
i kinda like it better
its for a different purpose
Nepotism 🔛🔝🗣ï¸
Oh yeah and business CV is different than science CVs
academia vibes (im dipping out of academia as soon as i finish my phd)
phd is wild
stem phd is free and you get paid to do it
The grind
Yeah thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m doing phd not med school
yeah
that and i like science
but tbh i would rather be on the other side
i wanna do drug development
2024 has been the best year of my life
Develop drugs???

Very cool very based, definitely take advice from a kid not even in college
yes but like pharmaceuticals

Tâ€™is what tâ€™is
Thugging it out 🤙🏼
Fr
There are several section of 227 so you can check on SIS
Search for the class there and it will show who is teaching
there's dobrosotskaya, orendain, and zhao
@roguish_raven has had Dobrosotskaya and Zhao, and I've had Orendain
ah okay
ty for the insight :))
the monetization of educational materials is disgusting
It worked for me logging into SIS
ok 😰
hope it's back up by the 16th
I think that Dobrosotskaya, Zhao, and Orendain are all good choices for calc 3
tysm! this was VERY comprehensive
i think i'll have math 227 as a good backup option then in case 223 gets filled
Is it like
Because if he doesn't say anything to me I 100% do not plan on saying anything to him until I see him 💀
I think you should at least say hi

me neither

Quod erat demonstrandum
do philosophy majors debate with people over abstract things
Yes \:)
Tis how I have my fun when I'm not bothering Hutchings
is that like "I rest my case"
do you show up to class, prof says "You're not on time, you are late" and you contest "well professor what is time?"
No bc that's a commonly held construct and one of out social contracts is a shared sense of how time works
is hutchings also a philosophy major
No Hutchings is Adam
ohh
I just call him by his last name
Occasionally
what is your favourite branch of philosophy
Right now probably aesthetics
so do you have like a definition of general beauty or general aestheticness
sounds very existential
I think Kant's aesthetics are pretty solid as a baseline, but I also think that industrialism has changed how we think about judgement concepts (as per Benjamin), so I still have more reading to do to find where I stand
It can be, but there's a lot that's relatively applied as well
Sorta dipping into psychoanalysis
now that's quite intriguing
I'm only slightly familiar with kant, but your idea of having to read more before you develop your nuanced stance seems quite mature and learned
It's just kinda the way it goes most of the time. I learned real quick when I got into philosophy that cementing which thinkers and ideas you agree with and choosing to stick with that too early can lead you down some weird rabbit holes and dampen your ability to explore other perspectives
It's also I think a kind of humility, wherein you recognize that you're a kind of eternal student, who always has more to draw upon and consider
Being too rigid in your thinking is a problem for trying to learn in general tbh
It's good to critically analyze all of the things you believe and why you believe them, whether it's philosophy or not
Yeah of course
Which is also why I think philosophy kinda connects all academic spheres
I'd say don't push yourself down into the I know nothing sector too hard, you can be proud of your accomplishments *while* acknowledging what you have to grow into
It's simultaneously harder and easier than you think it will be
do pre major advisors help w that, how do they
By the time you're going into your sophomore or junior year you're going to say, "damn, that stuff I struggled with in freshman year looks so easy now." And that means you're growing :)
huh
They probably can if you talk to them about your interests, and you can also just take a bunch of classes in different departments and see what you like
sounds more like relief but I see that yeah
I was planning on asking my advisor if taking two intro courses outside of the major i applied as would be okay
Other than nursing and music, which are a bit different
It has its moments
I've mentally changed my major plan through 5 different things. But I've had 3 different majors on paper
and on top of all that we have freshman forgiveness?
Yep
Ah beloved freshman forgiveness
woag
Add/drop's always fun too
Yep
thats another w
Add/drop period means that for the first two weeks of each semester, you can add or withdraw from classes with no penalty or record
With a couple exceptions (namely half semester courses which only have a weeklong add drop)
I think I've used add drop every semester
Or at least almost every semester
I just used freshman forgive lol
Stayed in too long both times
too good to be true
It's better to get a W than to ruin your mental health or damage your gpa
I suppose but I do research thoroughly what I get myself into anyways
Add/drop also means that your classes will fluxuate to some degree or another during the first part of a semester, which is always funny
that makes sense
I'm too disorganized for that lol
Oh I do too, but sometimes things surprise you
yeah that's for sure
but I trust what you guys have to say to be mostly true
No but I'm doing my best to keep that true
would you have to email the prof or can u just dip like that
You can just withdraw lol
Or drop
Same difference
Easy button on sis
Or well, a few buttons
no paperwork?
Depends on what you're doing and how it fits into your schedule
I'm just getting baffled every minute
I mean, I met with my advisor before I actually withdrew from a class, but that was my choice
I'm gonna just think about it next sem
smart choice
I'm mostly overqualified for my PE so I'm just taking it now for the meme essentially
I'm halfway done with my pe requirement nonetheless though, I'm not that concerned
It'll be easier and more fun than anything else I think
the people in PE make it fun
so like if ur tardy they just mark you down, sounds crazy
that;s harsh woah
ohh
what about like history
Like I said, it depends on who's running it
They're probably on the stricter side
Every professor has a different policy
Huge piece of advice for freshmen: Read The Syllabus
Since humanities courses are smaller, they tend to have more enforced attendance policies from what I can tell
If you're the person who emails your professor with something that is on the syllabus, they will be cross with you
Lmao understandable
Yeah
hopefully they're explicit about it in like the syllabus or smth
is renee sentilles strict?
Usually they are
noted
I mean. Yeah pretty much. Professors in college have way more freedom in designing courses than high school teachers have
I will really keep this in mind
ofc
Basically, two classes of the same name can be basically unrecognizable from each other because of differences in teaching style
You can have very different experiences within the same department and the same course level
that;s plain unfortunate
Not all 100 level classes are created equal
Lol, it has its ups and downs
yeah shoutout to sam for telling me about darth bader
I think it's nice to some extent because you can try to take classes that work better with your interests and learning style
would humanities profs be super biased to their own viewpoints?
Not usually, but keep in mind that these are really high-educated people so they tend to be quite morally and socially conscious
could you elaborate
Like
Exactly!!
sounds like a nice rule people forget too often
that's actually nice to hear
The professors that teach intro classes regularly are pretty used to it lol
I just don't see how I can call a renowned professor by their first name
Oh yeah uh just to forewarn slightly about that (tangentially), the conventions different humanities professors expect with regards to titles varies wildly, such that my major advisor and favorite professor goes by Jeremy but most of my other professors swear by Dr.
It's quite easy honestly lol
Some professors don't accept anything other than "Dr./Prof. Last Name" but others actually get annoyed if you keep calling them by their last name
using titles will be easy ngl, would a say Dr get angry if you called them professor?
Like Chris Butler only desires to be called Chris, if you try to call him "Professor Butler" he'll just say "that's my wife, I'm Chris"
A lot of humanities professors take your thoughts, research, and writing seriously, and you'll probably get referred to as a colleague at some point in an email
Nah not usually
huh interesting
Professor is a valid title for your professor unless told otherwise lol
I use Herr for my German professor for obvious reasons, and I think the Japanese professors go by san or sama
okay I'm gonna be fine then
does he have an army of TAs like how do you do that
lol
Yes
Army of TAs
makes sense
more like a fleet for nearly a thousand kids
The Butlerian Armada
wait a second nobody in college is a kid woah
Bro knows his plus signs
Some people start college at 16 or 17
oh yeah so mostly
Also even if they're all legal adults some people act like children sooo
did they skip a year?
One of them graduated early and the other skipped like 2nd grade or something I think
am I naive to assume maturity
cool
But yes
Yes
my best friend turns 18 in sept, yeah now I see why
that is
oh please I appreciate bluntess
well I'm gonna change my perception then
I mean same but some people have like emotions or whatever
lmao
There's also just all the silly and harmless shenanigans that come with living 30 seconds away from your best friends
is peer pressure as big of a deal as its potrayed?
Like an apartment
ahh
Not really at Case tbh
I mean, I'm not really the person to speak on this tbh, my neurodivergence makes me kinda immune
nice to hear
Yeah it's chill
Tbh I've had more peer pressure to play among us than I have to do drugs or drink or anything
(that's also bc you're in du but i digress)
Nah
Case actually is pretty strict about hazing bc of title 9 shit in the past
I should play that sometime soon
I heard about like some sexual assault stuff from teh 2010s or smth
Yeah
Before my time but you hear stories yk
I like that
osu is like wilderness
from what i've heard
I've not seen much of it lol
(lore?)
(Old glee club tradition, got phased out this year)
(interesting)
thanks for the tip that kinda reminded me I should do the anti hazing module
The people who prevented the death of glee club in 2014 made up a "secret saying" that we would use to close off rehearsal and had a special reveal each semester
wow and it just got phased out
I doubt a 200 year old uni would have a goofy tradition of humiliating new students
Whether it was hazing or not, or just started to trend a bit in that direction, the club is deciding to move away from it
I'm sure much older unis do to be honest
well I'm glad that's not the case
One of my fraternity brothers went to a boarding school where they unironically branded people 😭
(does that count as a pun)
*rimshot*
bro what
like fencing?
Yeah
He has some crazy stories about what they did at his high school
Nobody coming out of theta chi with a cool sabre scar
sounds like they made the geneva convention into a checklist
He says they were rubber
But it's the principle of the thing
nearly made me jump at chainsaws
I personally think it's uncool to chase around freshmen with things that appear to be chainsaws
sounds unpleasant
That's why I chase them with the scariest thing known to man . . . A yellow headband during HvZ
what is HvZ
Campus wide nerf war/tag game
😯
It's more complicated than that but that's the cliffs notes
Nein
I did use a site like that today actually, since the book I'm reading has an insanely complicated and obtuse chapter in it
Humans vs zombies where you get to live to be the scrappy survivors against impossible odds or become a zombie hunting down their dwindling number
It's fun
I'm also biased
sounds like a ton of fun
Zombies wear yellow headbands, which was the point of my statement
Happens every semester, if you're interested in playing just keep an eye out for when we start tabling
when is like "club rush"
You can join clubs whenever you want for the most part
I got some dense books and some books that imo changed my life
thats dope
But a lot of clubs are actively recruiting pretty early in the semester
Just go to the activity fair and walk around. Get on a bunch of mailing lists for free stickers then decide what you actually want to stick with later
Certain clubs (mainly athletic) build up your skills and knowledge over time so coming in the middle of the semester's sorta awkward
True, some clubs are more social and are cool with just dropping in
Others want you to build up a skill over the semester to perform or compete
hmm makes sense
would you say joining like 3 is too much
for your first sem
Not necessarily
Depends what they are
You'd need to actively balance your schedule more and it depends on how work-heavy your classes are but sure
I did three this past semester
hmm I see
In my first semester I joined a fraternity, was on rocket team, went to a craft circle every week, and joined glee club
is the first week of classes like light and easy or do they just dive right in
Depends lol
that's admirable
I got a 5 page intro essay the first week for one of my phil classes
Charlie's a king like that
was that your welcome to college moment
Nah it was spring semester
oh I see
It was my welcome to 300-level classes
I can see that
those numbers just sound intimidating
Yeah well
You get used to it
what was your welcome to college moment
Umm
Probably the expectation of reading a combined 80 pages a week
that's fun
Last semester I had glee club, my fraternity + exec board, played HvZ and got onto the core team, played DnD, went to craft circle, had a mentor through a stem club, joined an honor society, and had a job
Oh I also did play DnD my first semester
Charlie btw do you know anything about how sportsapalooza works
In what sense?
how, like how, seems like you maxed out time management
that's nice
Well not all of those were "all the time" commitments
My time management is not that good, I just keep doing things lol
You can just find people do play with you too
was dnd with ur friends or like through that club
The club holds weekly oneshot nights
Ah well
I did run a dnd club at my school
Actually the way I got to know Charlie was running an online campaign the summer before I got to case
Yo same!
my friends
ayy
that is a cool way to get to know eachother
what is he like as a DM
Yee
Oh I was the DM
oh what did you run
I love maritime settings the only adventure book I bought was ghosts of saltmarsh but only got to run 3 sessions
that sounds like a world with deep lore
It's a good aesthetic
I gtg rn and finish some hw but it was really fun talking to you and charlie
see you guys
See ya gn
Tabletop empire plays board games not DnD, check out the RPG club
Lmao me returning after an hour of inscryption (just got the game on sale)
Anyway my first DND campaign at case was through rpg club and my second was through some friends
me and my dried ginger
RIGHT

U good bro?
Time to get out the plague doctor fit
Nursing majors when someone on their dorm floor has the black plague:
(Consensual) bloodletting time fr
\:-(
My humours are imbalanced today
That's pretty funny in one particular way and not another
Kinda more like a strategic slice
Depends on the method but gotta hit a vein
if you use a large enough cutting device you can guarantee a vein to be hit
okay follow up question what's the largest radius circle that could be punctured in a straight line through a human body without hitting a vein
any choice of location is valid
Too many days
Probably a pretty big one directly through the skull
You wouldn't hit a vein
Fr
REAL
So real
I will be reading much more when back at home
too few
get your quintessences up

is that the railroad feller
Why let the brick and mortar chains of traditional education hold you back
Learn now

I aspire to have even a fraction of this man's power
good
With this by my side I could learn for centuries
My dream bookshelf
what textbooks do 308 and 321 use?
Entertainment set for a lifetime +
I assume it depends on the professor
my dad is like this for medical textbooks
Copy for convenience

there is a room full of german books in guilford basement
true
Whereâ€™s that?
guilford house is where i might as well live
right by tink
the yellow house looking one, if you remember it
CAMPUS MAP
Ehhh this would be better as an image wouldn't it
One sec
CWRU CAMPUS MAP
yeah for the womens college
yep for the women's college
🤝
sophie's too fast
lmao
Wait wtf
🤝
That was such low quality
Please hold
And now Jake lives there
im in the walls
Smart move
I mean
(i sit at the tables on the first floor and stare at books that I don't quite understand)
Where *else* would you be?
Okay FINALLY is the quality on this one good

im gonna be nolifing guilford even harder next year bc no way am i going top of the hill to my dorm more often than necessary
YAY
Sophie v (astr/phys/engl '27)?
adam if i had the time i would
one day im gonna walk in and say "sup jake" and youll have no idea who i am
You kind of get used to the stairs but you also kind of don't
Yo I should do that too
Pretty baller idea ngl
We should all do this
Pinned a message.
yeah makes sense

adam hutchings jumpscares are always welcome
We should all go say hi to Jake irl
thats what he looks like irl
oh you know derek lol
Dang I KNEW it
I'll be helping with freshman movein so if anyone wants to say hi just @ me
Would be really cool if it did
Just make one
Bro first I need to know who Iâ€™m looking for
Actually solution
alright I need you to picture a little guy. Now go smaller. Even smaller now. Now give him a beard and glasses and bam that's me
You know what? Bet
A gnome?
i'll send a selfie during move-in or smth lmao
i was picturing the same thing
Say hi Jake to every upper class men on move in
Jake are you helping with move in
yes!
Iâ€™m a genius
Yo same!!!
Hopefully I'll see some of y'all then
I just hope I get assigned the morning shift and not the afternoon shift
A lot of us will be here for freshman move in lol, including but not limited to probably Jake, Adam, Ben, me, Josh, Tyler, and Oscar
fish will hopefully be there too cause he's a RA
Do I email Keesha Sellars
Maybe I do
ik the physics freshman meetup has a lot of upperclassmen also so i feel like thats not a problem
Or Chris
This is actually a fire idea
I think I will draft an email and send it by some of y'all for review
so ready for another email to MAMS-all
"Please take HDP"
I so would if I could
SAME
hey gang spring sem 380?
Lmao how to spot me in real life:
First look around. Then look down. Further. A little further. Then look for glasses and very . . . Large hair or possibly a baseball cap. If this is paired with a shirt that has the name of a band you've never heard of then it's probably me
that one shirt with a mountain on it also
quintessential charlie shirt i think
What's POPPIN
Lmao true
I will probably wear a dr pepper shirt on move in day so my obsession is known
Sometimes I'm in the mood to wear a lot of brown shirts, but at other times I wear a lot of green shirts when I'm not wearing band tees
Biggest swag
Spot me in real life: look directly forward and incline your head very very slightly upward. Spot worn Kaiser Permanente blue sunglasses during the summer or blue jacket and blue beanie during winter, and that's me
Green shirts are OP
Or a green robotics shirt or a black hoodie with green writing on it
TRUE!
I have been defaulting to plain tshirts recently but if you are in an art museum and you see a shirt that indicates I eat oil paintings when security guards aren't looking that's probably me
I got one (1) pair of free sunglasses last summer and I see no reason to ditch them
Common Adam T-shirts: high school robotics team, Case or Theta Chi merch, random geometric-y designs, nice plaid shirts sometimes for literally no reason
my friends spot me through that like im some zoo animal
NOOOO
Will be a real grindset moment
those numbers are Too Big
now we're talking
It's just induction
was math 1 so good they made a sequel
it sure was
What do they call the new freshman CS thing
Is it a "meetup" or an "information session" or what
I do not remember
what is 408?
Cryptography
Cryptology
ooh who teaches it
Singer
meet & greet, i think
I always just think crypto lol I'm not actually sure if it's graphy or logy
or "explore [major/department]"
Actually Adam do you know the answer to this? Can a class count for both sages and arts and sciences breadth if it's a uger communication intensive course?
i think yall can switch to uger instead of sages, but im not sure about blending them
might be worth emailing your advisor
Well we're allowed to take uger communication intensive courses to replace sages for sure
I'm just not sure if they can also double count for our breadth requirements as they are also departmental classes
Fascinating
Also feel free to laugh at this but it seems my biggest scheduling challenge for graduating on time is going to be finding a time to take bio 214
And chem113
Good luck
Iâ€™m off to work, see yall later
Enjoy employment
Please pick classes ahead of time
Iâ€™ve been seeing others talking about â€œvalidateâ€ or something 😭
You can add them to your shopping cart
ahhh
You can search for classes and â€œadd to shopping cartâ€ instead of â€œenrollâ€
Then you can go to cwru.stellic.com and see your potential schedules
Thatâ€™s not signing up, it is making sure you can potentially take them
ok thanks
(From my understanding)
Lmao we're more of a squadron
@reddishlightning should I stick with 4 classes if Iâ€™m also taking academic seminar in the fall?
so 4 + seminar
Yea probably
Yes
word
Seminar is a class and u should treat it like one
If you think you can take 7 classes at once, good for you and thatâ€™s fine to do, but ease yourself up to that
then perhaps 7
Hutchingsmoding
Okay maybe but I also eased my way up to that
My first semester I took 4
hot take
you guys > advisors
i have heard some weird things about advisors, but also i know that for you guys they have to deal with advising for any possible situation on top of their other duties
vs us being on summer break and knowing about our own majors quite well
but i could never give good advice to a econ major on scheduling and such
Four year advisors are near useless, major and pre-major advisors have been quite helpful for me
for me personally, all of my advisors have been useless, the website is my goto 😭
My four year advisor straight up ignored one of my emails and then sent me an email about an entirely different topic a week later
The 4 years are good for resources around campus and accommodations if you need them from what Iâ€™ve seen. And it totally depends on the advisor too
Also just a heads up for everyone contacting case/professors/anything school related, nobody will respond to any email you send if itâ€™s not from your case email
And who are YOURS
I have Dr. Connamacher for CS and Dr. Meckes for math and both of them have been great
I have koenigsberger for English and he is the best
Kurt â¤ï¸
but yeah they could certainly do better and be more available
I'm biased towards major and pre-major advisors bc those two for me are also my two favorite professors at the university
ive heard ozguner is a good prof, i just dont think hes a very good advisor
and they were about course registration 😭
hey well shoutout to Joel, Sam, and Tyler for coming in clutch
wait what 😭
i feel like she should give u guys priority for now atleast???
Just pay it forward when youâ€™re an upperclassman
Anyone know how I should choose my seminar or is it automatic?
No, you pick after registration
ive heard 105 is slightly slower paced than 111
if youre applied math you should take 111
You think iâ€™ll survive 111 with minimal khan academy? 😭
Does the class start with basics?
yeah, but it ramps up pretty fast
Or the professor assumes you know said chem info
u should be fine tbh, like i said i knew pretty much 0 chem and i was fine
just make sure to keep up with the content taught and actually go to class(theres clicker points which is basically just points for attendance)
Would you rather take chem with premeds or engineers
Keep in mind that 105 + 106 gives you a year of gen chem, while 111 and 145 gives you a semester of gen chem pushed into one class and a semester of introductory material science
you should take it in the fall so I can be your TA :sunglass_cowboy:
Lmao I've taken 115 and 210 and I'm taking 110 next semester. Tbh they are fun if you find environmental science interesting
"Time to grade some assignments!"
"Let's see here... Adam Hut- ZERO! Alright, next student!"
me with phys122
I'm doing this with intro bio and gen chem lab
It's up to you Alex
Taking engr 145 in the fall will probably be the easiest of your options to complete that requirement
Hey, I graded for Skyler and graded fairly
and if you take 145 in the fall you can get me as your TA
Thats a good definition
Yes Tyler but I'm a Californian and we know how you feel about *those* people
I think you should also add the criteria "300 level or higher class that has "elementary" or "introduction" in the name without being a major requirement"
Okay true
And "subject matter of the class is best known by a joke by the wider population"
For shore
Introduction to algebraic geometry too
The fewer words in the title, the scarier
"Introduction to Differential Equations for Engineers?" fine
"Rings II?" RUN.
Lmaooo true
Gonna make a non exhaustive list of silly little math classes real quick
303, elementary number theory
309, sets, logic, and categories
327, convexity and optimization 
361, introduction to topology 
363, knot theory 
364, geometry 1
365, introduction to algebraic geometry
394, introduction to information theory
408, introduction to cryptology 
441, mathematical modelling
462, algebraic topology 
465, differential geometry
467, differentiable manifolds 
491, probability 1
492, probability 2
It was so funny when 3 math and CS majors all started typing at the same time
We are taking over slowly
Sure I'll add it
i was just gonna complain about knot theory only being offered even spring 😔
Senior spring will be your chance
Senior spring will be my chance for 462
ASTR 101 and 103 work but I emailed Chris to make sure. Itâ€™s nice to have an email from math@case.edu backing you up
Good to know
Just curious why itâ€™s not on the page then
Wow I need to take all of these
Pretty sure the page says "or other approved series from another science" or something to that effect

hey tyler we're on a totally unrelated note we're on very good terms right?
Oh. I think it used to say what I remember
https://mathstats.case.edu/bachelor-of-science-in-mathematics/
Anyway your advisor should be able to manually replace certain requirements with equivalent things if you so choose
just enroll into one of those for now, and then email ur advisor and ask them if u can do something else ig
REAL
Im taking chem 111 because i have to for cs
Love that
Give me a Ph.D
oh wait nvm i thought u were the other guy lol
u could do 105-106 for cs too
No, that's Eric Kaler

"Can I get an honorary doctorate because uhhhhhhhhhhh"
Me applying for a PhD: please please please please please
So real
wait how many upperclassmen here are TAs
TAs are often on a semesterly basis
I know Tyler has been a TA
I will be at some point
Tyler, Joel
Ben K
can freshman be TAs?
I want to pay my respects and join the Chris Butler squadron
That's being an SI
SI?
Supplemental instructor
sÃ­?
Nah I think Chris does have TAs
I know there are grad TAs but yeah havenâ€™t seen a UG one
okay good to know
i think he hires them yearly
He hires them mid semester
TA's are paid?
Yes
ohh
some are volunteer
They could pay me so little to help Mark Meckes
10 bucks an hour for grading sounds amazing
You bet I emailed him to ask
i may ta in the spring
How does one join the butler squadron
weâ€™ll see if my schedule works
I will TA in the spring
I'd like to have you guys as my TA
I'll sign up
whats ur major

biochem but like I might change
it has a lab section
that;s so blunt woah
two lab sections
Driscoll labs are like 30:1
TAs are for the lab
and the class is going from 20 to 48
Honestly same
so itâ€™ll be 1:12
Okay thatâ€™s reasonable
Meet Adam
Well I mean, what else am I going to say? Not like
"Dear Professor Butler,
Hey man, what's up yo? It's chill for me too, dawg. Anyway, ..."
same thing
no I meant his response
phd students are graduate students LOL
ig
I had a PhD student but masters students can also TA Iâ€™m pretty sure
It's usually PhDs though
Like what
Grad is grad. The minute you get a bachelors you become Labor
Because usually a part of the PhD contract is to work to earn your funding lol
yes
So a lot of the TA jobs are automatically reserved for PhDs
wait do MD students also TA if your major is in the SOM
i second physics 122
bro i meant phd students, but theyâ€™re literally called GTAs (graduate teaching assistants)
Youâ€™re gonna have to expand that last acronym for me
phd students are graduate students
i think discrete has ug tas
I do not know
hannah do med students ever ta
that's okay
Too many grad students to have UGTAs everywhere
on occasion they do
But I'm sure some do
but itâ€™s usually volunteer i think
woahhh
Gotta fund those PhDs somehow

bro iâ€™m just gonna ta for fun in the spring. my applications will be submitted by then
Iâ€™m still fighting the Illness but hopefully will improve over the next few days
Thank u for asking
rooting for your immune system
I teach middle schoolers my immune system ought to be STRONG by now smh
lmao
We are pure mathematicians Adam. Efficiency is for the applied folk
GTAs can be so fun
My TA was so chill for Driscoll lab 1 I hope I get a decent one for e&m
at least they're straight forward 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
My TAs for both Driscoll labs were chill as hell
Sometimes I see my first semester physics TA at jolly karaoke 😭
Unfashionably cool
Unfathomably
Okay good it was a typo, I thought you were hating
And I was like "that's so unlike Jake, he's not a hater"
Thank u
iâ€™m a hater
True
wow
the animosity
<3
It's okay to be a hater sometimes
I can try and be a hater for some things. Like I wrote a banger article about the football team
iâ€™ll be at freshman move in
Yes
alas
wow we might see you guys
Writing for the Athenian forces one to become a hater for all the fun reasons
Join the Athenian!
weâ€™ll find out!
It was titled "*You're Welcome?* No Thanks"
wait you guys are TAs AND RAs?
About the album you're welcome by a day to remember
I thought RA's were just disciplinarian people
Oh boy
iâ€™m just here for the free housing (this is a joke)
RAs have a lot of responsibility throughout the year for their residents
lol okay
RAs are mostly there to let some people sleep maybe sometimes when the other people in their dorm decide 3am on a Wednesday is a great time to bang on doors and also they give life advice and sometimes donuts (experience from my RA freshman year)
yeah so real
Theyâ€™re only opps if you really like setting off fire alarms tbh
just remember to put water when u microwave ur ramen 😭
Good rule for most of life Iâ€™ve found
it is what it is
now we know who they pyro of the class is hi
Oh yeah heads up. Your fire alarm WILL go off
wait I remember you guys said something about an incident about the fire alarm going off
itâ€™s usually not an actual fire
fun fact sprinklers do NOT stop going off when the fire is out
and will flood the entire building
Our fire alarm bugged out night 1 when we were sleeping at like 11:30 so that was fun. They traced it to our room and it was a faulty alarm. Then a few drills and a lot of microwave popcorn were the main culprits
Thatâ€™s lovely
the way id just sleep through it
I know so many people who slept through fire alarms
i did when it was my room
sounds like good
i woke up to people knocking on the doors
Me neither
and not the fire alarm itself
In the house? Or dorm
what dorm did you get
😭😭😭
Cutter
ah
What room
Dorm
what room
404
wait i forgor
upperclass rooms DO have sprinklers. this is mine.
i think @toojewforschool has that room
my ex bf lived there haha
this is so funny to me i need to stop
no itâ€™s funny trauma
@jschlanket if you keep your window open the garbage truck will wake you up at 5am
Noted
free alarm
Not a good time for the free alarm
Maybe i will add some value to the rooms legacy
for reference the garbage truck wakes me up in the village at like 6:30 precisely usually
my room faced the garbage cans, it was so fun!
Thats better than 5 though
i slept there like one time
in the garbage cans?
no
in that room
ohh
earlier i was looking at jimmy carters wikipedia page and he has like 50 of them
heyyy tyler, you're the TA for engr 145 this fall right
Entire DOCTORATES?! Not just degrees?
Wow
I'm one of 6 afaik
HONORARY doctorates
I just looked and remembered wow
😔
he only did one term he can do it!!
heâ€™s a little young for my liking but heâ€™ll do!
the people love jimmy carter
cool yeah I'm probably taking it this fall hopefully so I'll possibly be at your mercy
ok i lied he has 24
he's a cool guy
yeah heâ€™ll be 100 on october 1
which is my anniversary! so fun
it's gonna be a new prof with Wnek so it's gonna be interesting
I heard nice things about Wnek
he's my dept chair and my advisor
and I like him
but I'm also very biased
ah I see
I was told tests were open note too
we shall see
oh I did not know that
ayo did u get moved to fall !?
If anything i think that makes him more qualified
heâ€™s been in it for over a year
heâ€™s a survivor
heâ€™s an absolute icon
what other president has a peanut shaped statue
heâ€™s the only president i like
jimmy carter. thatâ€™s my president
fr? i think i had like 2 or something - one a drill one a burnt toast
i mean i was barely ever in my form first sem and i guess people had it under control by second
the cookies were good though
that is all that is important in life - if the cookies are good /j
i swear the freshman alarms are just way more sensitive
I think we only had one false alarm last semester and it was from a really big party that the other fraternity we share a building with threw
The amount of fire alarms is most likely going to mild compared to the daily fire alarms of my old dorm
(Hopefully)
I have many a great photo of peoples shenanigans when we had to trudge to the gym at 2 am
Old dorm?
Yes
what frat
just out of curiosity
phi psi
Yep, phi psi and DU share a building
weâ€™re going to live so far next year :(
True
There are a few other Northside fraternities but I know what you mean
If not for glee club it'd be even harder for me to find time to hang out with OX
You will come over to watch movies in the alumni room though
During O-week
🥺
Am I invited?
Hell('s?) yeah
Splendid
driving up the friday i think so if thereâ€™s stuff going on the weekend before classes lmk
A joint DU/OX movie night would be awesome ... if we had a big enough space to do that ever
Actually hold on ...
Mixer idea
\:-)
Where would we fit everyone though
strosacker 💀
No shot
The alumni room but very close together
Leutner
iâ€™m so happy to be free of leutner next year
Leutner basement for a mixer lmaooo
Do we have to wait the whole 10 minutes to find out if a class filled up or is it immediate?
crazy

It takes me 3 seconds to get everything enrolled
That good (I think?)
But yeah gotta train

I gotta go faster at 2.5
its today?
YES
dude 9am
💀
thought it was tmr
nahh
Today
Good u checked
thank god i woke up
lmfao
Do you have ur classes
IFKRR
yupp
Is there any steps after hitting enroll?
divine intervention right there
I mean Drushel does advise the film societyâ€¦
Can you have the boxes already checked and just hit enroll to save time?
Yes. And you should
Okay cool just wanted to check
good luck everyone
so glad i have power rn
nothern IO, IL, and IN folks i hope y'all do too
gl yall
hey for classes that i need to get authorization for (muen, muth) should i remove them from my cart or not check the boxes or just proceed as normal with them
Ok so in order to be fast
Iâ€™ll reveal the technique after
I have to win 😭😭

im j sitting here waiting for 9 on the dot
I just have to beat 7 people
you can check the boxes before pressing the button
before 9 i meant
I have everything checked
Ready with timers
what should i do?
on my mac, so it has the seconds
counting down
Ah nice
i usually check, validate, scroll through to check (if i have other stuff in my shopping cart that i donâ€™t want to register for)
i need to beat three 😭
i know people that will do both and hit register on both but i think that is very unnecessary
True
Seeing the seconds go by on the site triples my anxiety
the one mistake you should not make is hitting register before 9
first time i registered when you hit enroll it gave you another prompt
do you have a confirm button?
but I think there is a confirm button on mobile?
Are you guys pressing enroll rn??
LOCK TF IN
TWENTY MINUTES
yeah it gives errors for all the classes, I'm just testing it to know what to expect lol
why am I so stressed for this guys
it's just classes D:
fr
Okay good
Chat what is validating
And when do you hit validate
before 9:00
itâ€™s to check if your classes are good to register
I'm literally just watching a show lol
what is validating
Checking if you can take the class
....
just any time before itâ€™s time to register but not more than 5 min before
yes
Like no time clashes and you have met the prereq
making sure none of your courses overlap or prereq
so select all boxes
ok how do ivalidate
top right
yea
there should be a button
that says validate
okay thanks
can i do it now or more closer to the time
now
you can
kk
just get it out of the way
If there is an error, prioritize classes and come up with an order
if im in AIQS for fall i select my topic after registration right
I gotta beat 11 ppl
How do yk how many people?
One of my classes has one open slot
Surviving off of my hotspot rn
omg i have to beat 2 people 💀
I gotta beat god knows how many people to get that class
thanks
U guys said
After you hit enroll
And it loads
Keep it at RHE loading screne
Right
was it this stressful ur year
yes
itâ€™s this stressful every time
So I slept in jeans
😜😜
Ur so brave for that
I have 0 clothes
Based
That sounds like a challenge to me
10 minutes lock in
whats the difference between these two?
different sections
of the recitation
what does that mean
^
This is why you go delta
and you usually take a quiz
Expensive
ohhh i see
so i should just go for the one with more open seats right
yeah
Ok thatâ€™s what I did
okay sounds good
but you also have to consider that others are also going for the one with more seats
keep the other one in your cart
man im gonna love calc 2 at 8 in the morning
I am hyped
oh yeah so basically
have fun
three days of the week too 😭
LOCK TF IN
TWI MORE MINUTES
LETS GOOOOO
itâ€™s not such a big deal for the fall semester tbh
2 MINUTES
itâ€™s harder to wake up in the spring
lets get this dub
COME ON
LETS GOOO
my heart is racing
These countdowns are making this so much more stressful 😭😭
LOCK IN
45 SECONDS
COME ONNNN
30 SECONDS
Godspeed soldiers

That was quick
GOT UT

Oh wow

lets gooooooo
Congrats to the lucky few
RAAAHHH
clicked exactly on NINEEEEEE
GOOODDD
NOOOO
The site crashed, god dammit
AND ON A BETTER NOTE SPIRIRT FOUND MY LUGGAGE
😭😭😭😭
AT YHE SAME TIME
i thinkdubs
Godspeed and good luck to those waiting
Right
3/4 classes
Yep. Back to bed you go. Youâ€™ll get to do it again for next sem 🤩
We take the win lol
time for the circle
Wait now i canâ€™t log into sis 😭
4/4
We done
one class
https://i.imgur.com/u868pEa.png
when is the time 😭
Are you fall?
spring
It was like mid-december for me
says deadline is the 18th thats weird lmao
wat
itâ€™s done based on your schedule
so itâ€™s not going to be until you have your schedule for spring
ahhh
Yeah thats why I suppose
Spring AIQS peopleâ€” donâ€™t do anything. Fall AIQS peopleâ€” maybe do things in a while once the servers have stopped shitting themselves and youâ€™ve received a nice email that itâ€™s open for you to select AIQS stuff
WHAT DO I DO
OH MY DAYS

https://i.imgur.com/LIGKQTz.png
Send an overflow request
me with my engineering lab
😭😭
gonna have to figure out these times
gonna have to sprint or something
permission request
How
there should be a button that says submit permission request
Which?
how did all of physics fill up.
It just sends me back to the home page
Theyll have to open more
did u get into one or not?
I did
they rlly have to
lucky
Does it let you enroll in the lecture atleast or are you not in anything?
i gotta submit a perm request
the planner like
it added all the classes i enrolled in over the classes i had planned so now they're just on top of eachother
gotta remove the planned ones now
Oh my days
What do I do now
Thatâ€™s when my aiqs is too
I only have 13 credits
Any extra credits I can take
find a random intro class
Any recommend
intro to the stars?
Wait
What about core required classes
Does that satisfy a requirement?
well he said extra credits thats all i was thinking about
i assume astronomy falls under stem so it might not satisfy a breadth req
quick sidetrack but no actual way your name is red
this is crazy to me
its a preferred name
i aspire to be like you
nvm
Yeah I thought so but it sounded interesting and I wanted to try it
i might take it next semester though
we shall see
I think my schedule is pretty alright
Ok so my credits will add up to 21 for the first semester
With 5 classes
how do you view this page?
Print your schedule button
thanks
this literally always happens fwiw
you have to select fall 2024 in drop down and then print
I think it only works on pc
so
Yeah
Does any upperclassmen know what TR means for seminar selection?
Meets on Tuesday and Thursday presumably
i see
@reddishlightning is it just tues and thurs?
or additional discussions
Its just whatever it says
1:00-2:15-2:15-3:05
With no gap between classes? no
@cawu
Wait, 1:00-2:15? From my experience typically 1:00-2:15 classes are TR and 2:15-3:05 classes are MWF, are you sure they're the same day?
ok I see now
Why are all the sports stuff no credit
Itâ€™s all 0
Should I. Take 2 of them
Like a nutrition class hits for understanding global perspective
do you know what the best topics are in terms of work load?
some of these topics are a bit cringe
taylor swift????? 😭
Every topic will be a similar workload, but the types of readings could differ. Choose something interesting to you, and also mention the profs here cause we might know how good they are
for selection
So
😭

PSY 498, "Psychology of Taylor Swift"
the hype surrounding taylor swift
And according to the website
It's a full class
So
Erm
Yeah if it makes people happy, why not
No
It worked for me somehow
Where are you going to try to access it?
ive been going through my roadmap and reloading both my roadmap and the aiqs website several times
it just says this
â€¦
Huh
i think i'll email my advisor
Like either IT or the people in charge of AIQS
Is your aiqs in the spring?
mine is in the fall
In addition to the advisor
Oh then yeah definitely email
thats a good idea thank you!
Stupid question but did you mark course registration as completed?
yeah i did (hi jacob)
it shows up as received in my roadmap
Huh okay thatâ€™s weird
33 days
they said its because i chose a foundations seminar instead of topical
Lucky you
I mean at least theyâ€™ll be over quickly??
😭
Good luck with that
How lenient would you guys say connamacher is if you ask him to take the final earlier?
until you have a gpa, the maximum credits youre allowed to take is 19, so id look into dropping a class to get below that total
@ everyone trying to get into fall aiqs: it was a couple days after course registration for me
just check back periodically
wait what

some profs write the final like 1 or 2 days before
Yeah but thereâ€™s a chance that if I ask ahead of time theyâ€™ll have mercy
maybe at least one of them
https://i.imgur.com/0Ls83BV.png
8am final sounds brutal
but then its done
One of them is
It's impossible to escape having them a few times before graduation
I had two of those this year
May 3, 2024 was a wild and exhilarating day in finals lore for me personally
I know, just happy not yet
Whenever I have an 8am final I have to set like 7 alarms and 5 contingency plans to make sure I wake up lmao
id be concerned
but like
poli sci i'll live probably
Not all of them
But usually I finish somewhere around 2-2.5 hours
Most fun activity as they all say
I usually double and triple check but then I just leave
I remember when we took the 227 final and we were all sitting outside chatting while Adam you had misinterpreted a question and were completely reworking it iirc
I thought "hm, Adam is usually much better than me at calc 3. Maybe I messed something up by finishing earlier"
Oh yeah lol
Bro was cooking
"hey wait, these equations don't even graph a boundary"
ohhh i thought it was just 3 on the same day
That's all I'm hearing
0 gpa speed run
nm style
(if you were referring to the prof, ofc alex always cooks as an academic weapon)
internally i was tweaking
i also did a real dumb thing with the sphere question i remember
i think we should try to accomplish that
Real picture of me with my academic weapon (I open carried my piece to my final (I misinterpreted what academic weapon meant (I failed the final (and the class))))
at the very least music theory 1-4 each have 4 finals so pretty high chance for overlap
i have two finals next semester i think
the life of a senior
one on the 17th and one on the 18th
but theyâ€™re both in the best time slot
Okay so @jschlanket @idkwutmyusernameis2931 you two both know each other clearly, are you mirror images or evil twins as the spelling of your names implies
yes, I am temu alex
HE STOLE MY NAME AND TWISTED THE LETTERS AROUND
I slept with his friend
(we were in a diversity overnight and were roommates)
no I stole it from my cwru email
axl1145@case.edu
I was like huh, I need a new name, what if I add an e in there
Axle

I'm rolling
We can settle our name dispute in dodgeball
you know it
12-3 âœ¨âœ¨

ikr or skonzo
Now thats a great name
Woah that's kind of cool

Have you guys seen the family where they only name their kids names with the letters A L E X
Imagine having four numbers after your name instead of just three
Alex, Axel, Lex, ... ???
Three numbers? I just have two
WHOA
X Ã† A-Xii stays winning

.. interesting
creative
maybe I am secretly their second child
I definitely look 12
prodigy???
Connor only had one number. I think he's the only one I know who was that rare tho
One of my favorite activities is showing people a picture of myself from when I was 14 and having them guess my age
The median answer is 10
glasses
my freshman year RAâ€™s name was axel
and then they quit being an RA (because of me)
thatâ€™s a joke
allegedly
Dont try and slander the best major
real
you mean NURSING
Nursing is just an anti-math cult
ur actually raw donâ€™t worry â¤ï¸
yes but I'm learning to SAVE LIVES
what are you doing?
talking about IMAGINARY numbers

:)
That's what we're doing
yes I do need to know how to dose medicine
Imagine having glasses (the doctor yesterday said I have 20/15 vision)
my art teacher in middle schoolâ€™s legal first name is 7
Holy based
no I have glasses too
I used to have a friend named Steven who preferred going by Seven as a nickname
Anti-T agenda
lol
i had perfect vision until age 13
This has real "I'm Charlie, but you can call me Charles for short" energy
How many fingers am I holding up â˜ï¸
7?
YES!!!
dang heâ€™s good
valedictorian material
you are cured
LETS GO
now take them off and try to pour a bowl of cereal
â€¦ no
I think you should try to do cardio games glasses-less just for an extra challenge
I will if you will
bet
My dodgeball skills will be amazing
the real question is cereal first or milk first
true
true preformance enhancement
Help me finish this venn diagram
Does Rachel wear glasses?
And Eric for glasses
You're not short
Compared to some people I am

Come on there are dozens of freshmen here
What exactly counts as a based major?
In this case, any non-math major counts
Would you like to be a part of this venn diagram?
5â€™7
Alright I do not qualify as being short nvm
Why not lol
My â€œlittleâ€ brother in Theta Chi is 6â€™5â€ so I am LITTLE around him
What name would you prefer?
My little brothers in DU are 5'8 and 5'3ish
Test subject 1?
In that case I dub thee porcupine
are you sure you arent the little??? (i do know thats not how greek life works)
Very original! lol
Everyone who joins my frat gets to choose a â€œbig brotherâ€ who is sort of a guide for their time joining
gotcha

Those are the exceptions lol
Yeah the big brother/little brother tends to work like a mentorship thing
And there's some gift giving involved usually
We just have a lot of people who are rather tall
It just makes me look shorter
dw I may make u look tall
How tall are you?
||5'2||
I'm barely taller than you lol
I uh know how to discord yea
I saw the forward slashes and then just the nothing

I'll take that under advisement
new side quest?
What about just a couple vertebrae
That would have the fun side effect of paralysis
or urinary incontinence
Fine, a couple ribs
You could also give me a backpack full of math books so I stoop under the weight
or no diaphram contractions
also get buff
Wouldn't that just make your waist smaller?
Not if you compress down after removing them
gotta get that âŒ› shape
Sounds ethical
None of this is ethical
project for my bioethics aiqs
compression fractures have to be my favorite
does this count as consent
true, not something to joke abt

tall brother gang 🫥
Oh my actual brother is also tall but I was referring to my fraternity brothers
what are counters if not something to climb on
so thatâ€™s fun
But it always feels embarrassing to grab a ladder to get a mug for a tea lmao
simple solution
Nah it is kind of confusing lol don't worry
steal all their femurs
probably not in a campus
It's messed up lmao
Being short is only embarrassing/an inconvenience if you're the shortest one there
Sometimes people and their siblings do go to case
Charlie what generator did you use for the triple Venn
we are a special breed
I screenshotted a picture of an empty venn diagram and then used imgflip
okay but short is good for flight nursing
these are the dorm cabinets too
and thats what ACTUALLY matters
iâ€™m like. no one is THIS tall
5â€™8â€ is technically average
Yeah they must expect you to use a ladder
gotta practice your spiderverse skills
- guy who's 5'8
I bet we can get this one filled up in short order
Lol yeah
Tell me who you want me to put

Wait who's a non math yes cs major in glub
Once upon a time I would have said Daniel
Maybe they're just a myth
average is 5'9, 5'8 is below average
fun fact: uniqlo models their men's medium shirts on 6'2 models
hello that is insane
wdym everyone is 6'2
Not me, I'm '26
I read your nickname as saying youâ€™re 26 years old 💀
I am fosho (- 1 foot)
That was a typo, I'm 260
this message made me realize iâ€™m closer to 26 than 16
I'm closer to 11 than 26 lol

@mounjee  what kinda hiking are you getting up to this summer??
I just got back from a trip in Spain, so I've been going to the various parks there. My favorite was Cercedilla, a nice little mountain town with good hikes
Idk what I'm gonna do now that I'm back on the west coast but I'll figure something out
when theres a will, theres a way
thats so neat man
They make it very easy
The train from Madrid to Cercedilla was included with the Metro card
nice, love good public transport
Yess
My favorite Cleveland public transport:

Thanks for coming to (2) my Ted Talk
Have you been round to Cuyahoga nat'l park yet?
water (ice) slide
Tbh i forget its even here -a local
There is a divot in the road by the main crossing on campus
Water pools there
free shower
nice
My favorite part is when your walking and someone moves closer to the water to purposely try and splash you
it was me
I had to crack open the Cuyahoga county municipal code at 11 PM
1500 page PDF
Sounds like a good read
adelbert river
Do people really do that???
Not sure if its just a downtown thing or uptown too
Itâ€™s a PDF I can just splice it back together
bc i in fact had to cross adelbert
@mounjee the background got messed up somehow
Yeah you may have to redo it on PERSONAL COMPUTER

Interesting
Does students eat during lectures?
Are we allowed is the question?
Dang so maybe I shouldnâ€™t squeeze my classes into a block
Yeah
Thereâ€™s enough time to grab food in 15?
There was for me
Do you have to be pinpoint on time to class?
If itâ€™s a small class, you should be
Chem and japanese makes sense
i had her for the first 4 weeks of 223 last spring and shes great

i'm in the daily! wah :mochishh:
first that magazine they sent now this
they grow up so fast 😭
I feel like the fact that youâ€™re in TIME MAGAZINE is slightly more impressive
if it isn't disruptive its fine esp in a large lecture or if the prof is cool with it
last semester in music theory multiple people would eat lunch in class
224 with Liz last fall was a good time
Can you prescribe me Ozempic Dr. Wang
Claspy good for AIQS?

Current Case students, help me expand this list:
TOP 2 CASE STUDENT CONVERSATION TOPICS:
- I applied here for college
- My high school was so messed up
â€œi got rejected from my top choiceâ€
I've said it before and I'll say it again:
Case might not have been your first choice,
but once you're here,
make it.
Top choices and dream schools don't matter when you're here with everyone else lol
"Nice weather we've been having!"
i applied ed to case lol
Name, hometown, major, dorm.
No such thing as too much
Lies
corporal 😭
yall have taught me too well ill be sitting in diffeq and the prof will say something about the general solution and ill instictively salute
YES!
You have Owen to thank for that
Fed
i am fed! i had a nice pasta dinner
Mmm pasta
"Im transferring to Columbia next semester"
Remember when we went to that place in Lil' Italy
yes
The waiter topped off my Sprite glass with some water from the pitcher 😭
😭
â€œ[insert insult about Eric Kaler here]â€
If you follow cwru accounts it could've been that way
Could just ask them how
You get access to your roomate's demographics and address and other public info in the housing website
With that its pretty easy to find everything about a person (something something mr robot..)
Bro hacked
related to my real life identity whatsoever
i assume its because of me following cwru
are you following people connected to your actual identity
yeah thats probably it
the internet is such a beautiful place. our hubris will be our own undoing
How many colleges does the average case student apply to prior to undergrad?
i think i applied to like 10
But Iâ€™ve heard from case applicants specifically as high as 40
One of my brother's friends applied to 70
â€¦
I applied to like 8
Dude they should get a medal or something
I think it would do the world good to have a cap on the number of places
Higher acceptance rates all around, less money being spent on applications, less wasted time for AOs, etc
True but then people game the system which makes it less fair
Which is society sometimes but if you are going to impose an artificial limit on people
That they did not quite get to opt into for something that could determine a lot of a persons future
And it is not a universal law
It does kinda make sense though at the same time
I only applied to 7 but i withdrew one of them so technically 6
having to critically think about why you apply to schools or choose them opposed to a more is more approach yea
i applied to 3
i probs shouldve applied for more to see if i couldve gotten a full ride but oh well
i applied to 10
how even
common app caps at 20
and 50 separate applications to fill out sounds like hell
Wow yall are applied to so many I just applied to 2
I was gonna apply to all the UC's till I saw that it was $70 EACH
jeez
I mean it was one in state school that I knew I'd get into and case so
Ohio 💀
Its own kinda achievement, flex even
Youâ€™ve heard of OSU, now try UNM

nah its over, better hope community college takes you
i applied to 14 but only bc i had a common app fee waiver
coalition
and if i had put more thought into my college list i could have gotten that down more
cwru was lowkey one of them but i love it here so âœ¨âœ¨
Where do you like for grad
i really really really like tufts
but tbh with grad school itâ€™s just like. wherever will take me
(but i really like tufts)
Nah thatâ€™s the smart play, actually getting a job
"My name is Hannah and I'd love to work at What Happens When I Poke The Brain Here Co."?
So, what happens to the brain if we give it this chemical?
yeah p much
"I'd love to take your Entry-Level Can I Snort THIS Much LSD And Still Be Alive position!"
Sounds like organic chemistry to me
i LOVE organic chemistry
I got a college chem textbook at a book sale when I was 8 and read through the entire thing in a weekend
I was a nerd back then

Bro was on another level
8??
Remember Adam is the nerd of nerds
He is the final boss, being called a nerd by him is the highest honor of nerdom
probably coalition app
medchem medchem medchem!!
tyler i literally already said that 🙄
Too much lore to catch up on
okay i see you speaking over women ||/j||
your honor I did not mean to speak over women, please forgive me :pleaseiamjustalittleguy:
I applied to 9 I think
Alright Tyler time to change your name to Tyler | '26 Polymers Software&Engineering
I applied to 6?
they were my top choice for undergrad lol
Epic
So I got a lot of rejections lol
yeah me too
bc i think uva did that to me and waitlisted me
No
Guys.... I might be part of the problem 😔😔
I applied to 22
Bro
That's too many
In my defense
I had waivers for all of them
Itâ€™s official, I revoke it no take backs
But if you had to write supplemental essays for all of them I pity you
Kinda respect the grind?
I recycled! Sorta? Look the fear of not getting into anywhere kicked in then I started spamming applications
Also I needed a lot of aid
I second this
College apps had me second guessing how to spell my name
(I kept looking at my passport)
Therefore axel is going straight into the new grad rn workplace
2023 was so brutal
Very very year fosho
Glad u cld move on from situationship
Situationships when 👎👎👎
Oh wow, you must've suffered
Not the best year of my life but definitely not bad
Plus highschool drama just sounds so much better as a senior
My high school was low drama
Senior year was pretty chill all told
Like half of my grade's teachers quit/got fired
It was VERY chaotic lol
Wait â€¦ what.
:0
sounds like my former school too lol
but it also almost burned down bc of a wildfire
Come take AXEL 323: Introduction to UWC Lore
Lucky😔
This same teacher also would teach calorie counting
ewww
love being done with ib 🦅
How to start a conversation AND trauma bond at case: "maaan I hated the IB"
That's not even everything this teacher was absolutely crazy
I watched one video essay on this but it is interesting how it kinda diverts people to the view of movement and self-care as something fun to a chore/punishment
I can imagine smh
ew history
the one subject
i think thats a broader cultural thing as much as just school gym
exactly (can u please send that video essay if u can find)
Once told us not to eat yogurt bc it had too much sugar
Finished mine at 2am cuz i kept finding bugs while doing the video for it
gym and reading
Huh?? My bus teacher used to give yogurt as prizes to the fastest student
lemme look
I submitted mine an hour before IB's deadline. Can you tell I was my teacher's fav student.
real
same
Your teacher's were evil😭😭
Mine were just funny
Not funny haha funny weird
Not all of them just this specific one all the others were great
That's crazy
i got yelled at to â€œstop talkingâ€ when i sneezed in 7th grade english
sounds about right
I would be too😭😭
Did she also make a lot of "back in my day" comments
i swear pe teachers are either way out of shape and cannot run or push their crunchy granola eating disorders onto children
Yes so many of those omg
The more general conversation / trauma bonding is "man my high school was SO messed up ..."
Yup sounds pretty accurate lol
I think America take PE wayyyy to seriously
Our PE teacher would have us run laps ... and follow along in a golf cart
We were given a bunch of balls and told not to break anything or each other
It's ok it let's us trauma bond later in life 😄
My high school itself was pretty good, but being a high schooler surrounded by other high schoolers is an ordeal
https://tenor.com/view/paul-blart-mall-cop-kevin-james-gif-4287430
As compared to where
â€¦.. my gym teacher was just a creep who should have gotten fired years ago
My humble little country lol
I think my childhood best friends mom also mentioned something like this once
Yeah gymnasium can determine your entire future in Germany
Seriously what is up with gym teachers and being creeps
It comes with the position
It was literally the norm
Capital G Gymnasium is the name of a kind of high school, I mean Sport
I know
Lol
I was making a dumb joke
was too good for us
https://tenor.com/view/tngc-eden-georainbolt-gif-26321707
I've actually never met my pe teacher
The lowercase works better for the irony
That's crazy
adam reveal?? (what am I looking at)
No this is Rainbolt
.......
He's the person who can see like a picture of a place and figure out exactly where it is
Geoguessr guy
Geoguesser guy
Geoguessr guy
oh the bagel guy
one day, I am just uncultured
Well, I'll be at this little school in Cleveland in about a month if any of you are going to be there too
Nah why tf would I go to Ohio
dude no way me too
niche place not sure if Ive heard of it
You need to send a photo* so people can recognize you
*one of them, specifically
Whoops
yeah why would you
It would be funny if my pre-move-in face reveal was one of the two Analog Horror Adam pictures
I mean
Haha Iâ€™ve seen Adam in personâ€¦â€¦.
TRUE!
bro is flexing on us
The way I see Adam is as a guy with brown hair who would probably grow a ginger beard
another bot
I hold the secrets you all hunger for
As if I could grow any beard 💀
Maybe in a few years
Probably has to do with me being kind of face blind
I mean it's closest to red that's not red
Last year I made a hobby of figuring out who these people were and telling other people they had red hair
You are one of them Adam
You know, "yeah this person has red hair actually" and then "wait fr?" and then the person in question says "NO!!!"
Yeah, it's like people who don't have red hair but could probably have red haired children yk
People insist that I have red hair. I used to have red hair but it all turned brown and now only some of it is red
So ig I have red hair
ever
You are to me
I totally believe this
Interesting
Adam if you ever have little red haired children I will say "I told you so"
Only two freshmen on this server have ever met me in real life
my sister dyes her hair red but she is in fact a brunette
i donâ€™t think weâ€™ve ever met in real life
I can kind of see the undertone
I refrain from threating you or your cats ||for now||
I think the only senior on this server I've met in real life is Zach ChemE
Good youâ€™re associating with math more than physics, love to see it
my sister had blue eyes as a baby
then they changed
Both of my younger brothers had super super super blond hair as kids and now have light brown hair, but I've always just had brown hair
youâ€™ve met by boyfriend so like itâ€™s fine youâ€™ve basically met me (weâ€™re actually very different)
I saw you in that photo you posted the other day
😭
That's a Tyler moment
When I told one of my friends me and my bf were dating I had to repeat it like 3 times for him to process it lol
I mean the only use for chemistry I can think of is cooking meth
You probably will
https://tenor.com/view/pon-gif-15097379091171620462
-actual picture
Lol, meeting me is not equivalent to meeting my boyfriend in any manner of speaking
Adam looks like he enjoys Minecraft
i actually love hearing about people who know us separately finding out weâ€™re dating.  itâ€™s very rare these days
you will definitely have menacing red lightning striking down around you
Noted
Yeouch
You know it's true in your heart
Ofc not but saying I "look like" I do is an implicit burn
Guys is it time for the 2 week minecraft phase but its the entirety of this server
Was it true
yk the chat is cooking when you get the .... serveral people are typing
i was dressed in clothes for my interview
like business casual
so probably
Yes ik lol
Tbh with the way I dress I combine high school boy chic with guy who calls you a poser
I definitely don't enjoy Minecraft. Anyway rate this house I made last month
R/oddlyspecific
house out of 10
9/10 because i like bricks
Based
r/foundthemobileuser
Very sturdy house better than what rich people on insta are doing to old houses
Iâ€™d give it a â€œprobably would sell for above average price in my areaâ€
7/10 the roof is throwing me off
2 million in Toronto
loaded
What about it
Thatâ€™s the joy of it
Okay at least this is an improvement when I was 14 my houses would be stone brick rectangles
this kind of reminds me of when i played on a townie server in minecraft and my town got a new mayor that stole my house
i was 13
Well if you look at it really well and ignore one of the beams then it looks like a face with a graduation cap
(I might just be weird)
I used to try to scam people in the chat of Factions servers
So ... I had to go have a chitchat with the VP
Highlight of ninth grade
believe it or not I have never actually played Minecraft
~~several people are typing~~
Minecraft is so funny to me bc my elementary school had a Minecraft club
"If you type your password the game will censor it"
Itâ€™s only fun if youâ€™re playing with other people
Real
we're gonna change that, suggesting a DU minecraft night recruitment event right now
Sigma Nu had that once
wait then we can't
we gotta respect the copyright of sigma nu's recruitment events ||/s||
Does anyone have any current or recent two-week Minecraft worlds
I will rate your houses
I just like digging holes and making things underground
I play too much skyblock to do that
I only steal villagers houses then dig down....
I do have the 4 stage Redstone S/R latch minecart catcher which I am very proud of though
It's a fun way to find new creatures
I definitely don't have a problem with playing minecraft
Same
I have but its been a solid 4 years
reject humanity, embrace hobbit
Itâ€™s the best way to do it
Holy smokes dude
Toby did you use any tools to help or did you place all of this manually
I have throught about doing a scale model of the quad in minecraft

Itâ€™s a hoax by the liberal media
we shall see if that actually happens though
It will be inaccurate unless the game adds a slush block
we can do it during summer?
True
we also gotta add the scale model construction site for yost's demolition
HvZ simulator
Not anyone you know
That's so petty lmao
This reminds me of that one 2b2t FitMC video about the obsidian wall
I was very petty in 10th grade
how.
How did you get that much obsidian
engineers explain
I aspire to be like that
💀💀💀
Holy hell
was it worth it
I think i destroyed 5 pillars
It's a mix. 
The world has existed since 2014 or so. 
I got it on a server with world edit about 4 years ago which I use the fill tool that has made it way faster to put in floors, ceilings, and windows and significantly increased my rate of building.
I had nothing better to do in 10th grade so yes
Iâ€™m trying to get stuff done today but Iâ€™m too invested in this chat
pet cat? touch grass? sleep?
we are in the same dilemma
Didnt have any cats at the time, the other two no comment
It appears this message killed the chat
single handedly
Depends, on what you may ask? Yes.
What have I done
It fumkin wimdy
Depends on what it is
But its summer.... that's what you do during the summer
It has rained in the months of June, July, and August 3 times here in the past 12 years
We have a good wet/dry season
I mean true
Alright I'll give you a zinger

wind can get annoying but i absolutely love the snow
currently not locked in

A&P nerd
Your move
Oooooo i love this one
Is that biology?? Idek what that is
yes how blood clots
It is fine, as a chronic warm weather liver Cleveland is a nice switcheroo
You split it into x and y and then solve it like a double integral, right?
but I cannot tell you anything more because I am valuing discord more atm
Something like that
Krishna who I believe you've talked to, saw an integral and solved it before another friend of mine had even finished reading it
I think it was something like

on the other: the illusion of human connection through a screen
Krishna is just built different
It is exciting!!!
Shhhhh human connection is human connection
Agreed
Take what you can
I meeean I could run into some of yall on campus in t minus 32? days
Yes, @michael_cjr you will inherit some massive powers
so isnt just an investment in my future?
Exactly ur just making friends now so that when school starts u already know people :DD
but also then more later study for a&p
No no itâ€™s the physics building
Mathematicians stare blankly when they see any â€œnumberâ€ higher than 2
You can study with ur new friends!
Itâ€™s a crime
trueee I like the way yall are thinking
so valid
Yeah we're literally in the same a&p class
Hah!
Love island... reality shows just hit different
there fr are 2 conversations goin on
I think about no one is lol
Wow ur teacher is a snitch. Our teacher just called us cattle and gave us the silent treatment.
CATTLE??
I got a 6 on ib so a win is a win
simple solution: moo back
lets gooo??
Darn it. This would have been so much funnier
Or am I thinking of someone else
what this server has taught me
Yup.
Ik ik😭😭
real
I already finished the hysterics
I have more phy to do too

if you want to do cool compsci things you can also take category theory
Wow that is me
true
love digital footprint
😭😭
I was indeed tripping

comp sci majors can u confirm?
happens to the best of us
You and me both (I do not look where I am walking)
This account just followed me
Ur being recruited
darn it
Nice! ( I can't walk straight and always bump into things)
his 1000 something pages?
was it more rural than case?
I fear you may be a danger to society
thats what Im hearing
Yea of course
Its a good book okay
nah he has like 1 or 2 (I think)
🤨
I actually have two of this book if you want one
1044
Sir, respectfully, that's crazy
And you read this willingly??
I think Iâ€™ll do a giveaway of this book during orientation week
meaning you are done??
or the extra
I mean i have a pdf of the book if i ever need to look back but i mean i did learn/read almost the whole book
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY WITH YOUR "SWITCH" OR WHATEVER
wait math majors
If you had to choose
why the full government name for tso
next question
whatâ€™s next, are you going to call the greenie the greenlink?
What do u not use full government names randomly for fun?
Ending my life
idek
yea probably should have not asked such a doomsday question
i bet youâ€™re going to say lootner
true
I love how I do not know what either greenie or lootner is
When I was in high school I memorized a bunch of people's students ids so I could use them like names
I have this one friend that all my friends just call by her full name all the time 10/10 would recommend
fun pastime
ok Charles
CWRU spoilers (no context)
cwru spoilers (no context)
Channach
cwru (pronounced crew) spoilers
Im a simple man I know teletubbies house and nursing building
I did that to one of my friends too. Even threw in her grandfather's name lol

guys iâ€™m so excited to have my little leutner o week treat bc im an RA
NURSING BUILDING MENTIONED 💯💯💯
I refuse to ever call it crew
Crew or case
Whenever I say CWRU in chat imagine I'm pronouncing it crew
itâ€™s so much more efficient than saying C W R U
Crew?? personally I say C. W. R. U.
i also used to do this
C W R U GO SPARTANS GO
this is so silly because this is exactly how i was when i was your age
For some reason I always ignore the w when reading cwru. I just think C R U
Hannah (like one year older): when I was your age
grus cousin
But I can say case

th-wing
no one can beat my dad touring the campus
ok so lore
he called ting twink
I actually laughed out load when I read this lol
there was a senior my freshman year of hs that went by his full name solely because when he signed up for his first audition he thought he needed to put his middle name too and he got the lead so thats all anyone knew him as

and iâ€™m just too lazy to remove it
Wait thatâ€™s supposed to be â€œyesâ€ and not yet 😭
Oh well
Sounds fun
oh yeah? how do you say it then?
i swore this up and down and by august i was saying crew
not uagust
september
itâ€™s a canon event
so true
guys help some fucker in this shared office is playing his music out loud
it sounds like a hotel
"case western reserve" sounds like a bank tho
Oh good heavens. I shant believe it. Hannah? A year. . . . And a half older than me???
SING ALONG OUT OF TUNE AS LOUD AS YOU CAN
Lucky for you my parents call is caze west
We need a best western at case western
PLAY UR OWN MUSIC BACK LOUDER
Caze West is great
challenge him to a dance battle
Incoming freshmen, impress current students in your first week by learning the alma matter
Winner gets music rights
Now sing it with me: shine on forever, case western reserve
the waht
Loyal and true are we
It's definitely unique unlike best western copycat
Your brave sons and daughters
call it the aux battle
Your knowledge we use
To make our mark on history
iâ€™m over 3 years older than most of the freshmen
Our school days weâ€™ll cherish
But what if I'm not a son or daughter
Forevermore
A lifetime of friends from the start
Your brave sons, daughters, and secret thirds
found the loophole
Are you guys trolling?
Shine on forever, case western reserve
Youâ€™ll be
they should offically change it to that
Or is this something that's actually been written down
Forever in our hearts
HECK YEAH IM A SECRET 3RD
We have to sing it at every concert
It is real
the best gender
This is the real school song
Guys be real with me
Is cwru a cult
Glee Club might be
Nah, every school has a song like this
CWRU is not
As someone who's been in way more cults than the average person case is not a cult
Itâ€™s the best cult
nah thats nursing
Like actual universities??
You have to be joking
instead of hvz
actually no in addition
this is an official proposition
Yes
Pretty much every university has their own little song
Given how almost every new freshman in this server is either CS is nursing I thought it would be that
uhhh kinda tells u which is better
yes
Nursing would win easy
and theyâ€™re not creative about it
theyâ€™re generally all called the alma mater
Cs majors should be able to join
The one which is more exclusive
🥰
Real
yes each other major can choose a side
Wow I thought you guys were joking
No we're deadass
That's very interesting
I'll find a video of us singing it
Most people don't actually know the alma mater, but me and Adam do because we sing it for glee club concerts
The alumni like it and then give us money
We also know the case institute of technology alma mater
lemme talk to the higher ups
And the CWRU fight song
It should imo
fight song?
hail to the college whose colors we wear
When they give pe credit for ultimate Frisbee
With hearts sincere alma mater
Noooooo
Hail to thee, Case alma mater
Oopsy
thy sons in song loud thy praises declare (not even daughters here smh)
Now it's the one I said
Here
we love thy stern walls with ivy oergrown
We love thy long halls where times mark is shown
thy mem'ries dearer than all else we owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn
This is the alma mater being sung
HAIL TO THE CASE ALMA MATER
Ur not tricking me into getting a virus are you👀👀
Oh ... I did not know that
theres gotta be oneon the youtube
Hoo rah kai rah
yeah
you could probably also share just the video instead of the whole folder
s
c
live in vc? (guys I promise I can spell)
bet
I mean with me, Adam, Sophie, and Eric we actually have all 4 parts
The latency might be fucked though
that's what makes it beautiful
Give me a minute to finish my yogurt
true but there are many inoffensive offices down the hall
Wait are you guys singing it rn?
no
waiting for charlie?
We can't actually sing lol
Have you ever heard happy birthday on Zoom
D:
Give me a minute then we'll try lmao
7ï¸âƒ£
@reddishlightning are you coming back
I have a meeting 😔
D:
was so good
Beautiful job everyone
Adam voice reveal will come later
For those of you who did not hear it before
yo tyler???
dun dun dun
Absolutely amazing
Im shedding a tear rn
Im loving the private concert
Absolutely phenomenal!
Ikr I feel so special rn
FOITH???
a bathroom concert
The most private type
stunned
blinded
YOOOOO
Dub
made their day
MY PRONOUNS ARE CWRU-USA
🦅🦅🦅
we salute the flag (we were actually given)
💯🦅💯🗣🦅🇺🇸

Lmao glad you appreciated
I liked our private concert better
you can spot some of us in there!
your challenge is to figure out who's who
Private concert ftw
Always
Bet
This sounds like a good challenge
wherer
show me
D:
Good guesses but yes, incorrect
Meeting is over now
You will find out who I am in T=32 days
Can I make a guess?
Ofc?
No porcupinecuddler, you specifically cannot make a guess
Nah looks like red is Quinn and yellow is andrew
Keep in mind though I do have at least one doppelganger in the photo
Right I think Charlie is the one in the second to last column and second row
Debatably two
||pretty sure you got me lol||
LET'S GO
Glasses and the fact I can barely see you
Nooooooo
Pls reconsider nursing is cooler
Stay winning Porcupine Cuddler
I plead forgiveness
Yeah and who can draw blood?
Short people for the win!
Lmao
The guy kind of blocking me is actually the same height as me
The amount of my head you see is about the height of the riser
We will settle this on the court
The dodgeball court?
For settling disputes I'm a fan of the classic sock duel
Also good
Sock duel???
Each person gets two rolled up socks and the goal is to hit the other person with a sock before they hit you
Look out porcupine if a sock comes flying at you during move in
Dobey dodgeball
A video might exist somewhere but I don't have it
Be thankful
Yeah they sang 2 songs then everyone left
Woah.
Sounds super legit
I also gave a brief glimpse of my face in VC
But yeah shine on and Mary Lou with no lead was interesting

As with Porcupine Iâ€™ll DM you results
Of the guessing game?
i realize yall have nothing to go on for me lol
hmm
im blond
no adam. you cannot.
Sophie is also a big fan of space
That may or may not be helpful in determining their face
true although im not sure how useful that is
Can I provide another Sophie hint?
go for it
Sophie is German
true ive been told i look like it
i certainly am very white

And eventually be correct
What fun is that
True
Guess a blonde person who looks German and like they like space
no but that might be the other blond sophie in the group (yes im being fr)
Thereâ€™s 2?
yes
I once said â€œGetting face reveals of people either look the exact same as youâ€™d imagine, or look wildly different. No in betweenâ€. You are as Iâ€™d imagine


Anyways is this eric lol
close! that's a daniel
that is very important for identifying me

This you?
Lmao, guess I'm not shattering minds with my face
If not then I'll just take the  L
Eric I think you might not actually be visible in the photo they sent
yea
So they're not gonna get it 🥺
Halloween
haha i know where sophie is

Thatâ€™s crazy
Emotionally you look like you wear glasses
Sophie is not 6'5
sophie and i are twins in another timeline
It's a value neutral statement
My doppelgangers in that photo are David and maybe Alex if you squint
Alex is the guy standing right in front of me
We're mostly just the same height with similar hair colors
David and I get mistaken for each other all the time
Is this eric?
Wait shoot

How many Davids are there????

@cygnusxxii
Just the one, he's my doppelganger
Oh wait he said Daniel last time. Mb mb
No just stole ur screenshot
Yâ€™all will meet all of us in a month have some patience
Is he not in the photo or just hard to see?
thatâ€™s cj she is a whole adult and not me
Patience? Whats that
This is fun 😔
True but I will happily remain in the shadows
Can you find Eric in this picture (itâ€™s just a picture of Eric)
I mean I saw a dude blending into the background
Guess I'll just have to call it quits lol
Spoiler: Adam is in the walls
like he was at the concert right
i have given you very little information so you get to go on vibes
no i found myself in the video
just not in those photos
got it
In none of the photos we sent?
no, my face is not visible in any of them
valid
You remain anonymous
I also give up
You win eric...
28 server meetup come fall
True
When do you arrive
the friday or saturday before classes
not sure
I arrive before the freshmen do
Campus will be so empty
When do you arrive?
August 16
Twins
I could try and stalk and jumpscare you
International move in?
Yes Alex, that is absolutely a thing that one could theoretically do
I think they called it 'envision weekend'
Oh yeah cool
Bc thereâ€™s that and then I think students from abroad move in on the 16th as well
I mean im that too
Nice lol
Or is ur room like not available or something
Which is weird but I live in the us so not international
Yup
Womp womp
Rookie move
By the way I imagine bringing stuff is hard internationally, but I came with three suitcases and a backpack and that was all my stuff for college
Well fortunately I will not be having as much stuff
So move in should be fairly quick
Well itâ€™s like clothes and toiletries and electronics and a pencil case
Some people bring SO much stuff
Your room will not be usable if itâ€™s 80% full
True true
To store? Iâ€™m not sure
Minimalist dorm it is
You have a very neighborly face
What is a neighborly face
oh maybe i misunderstood
You're in Ohio??? 💀
Well I'm not there
But on the other hand ...
Ohio 💀
iâ€™m on campus this summer
i am in fact Here at case
Capitalizing here but not Case lol
emphasis on Here
you shouldâ€™ve just been on campus this summer smh
I was on campus for 3 days
so many people are here this summer ngl
i have so many friends
when
June 23 - June 26
Yeah ik ik. I'm technically not international but I also am so I qualify for both I guess lol
when r they gonna drop finaid
I am so nervous
Gotta make the most of it
Thank you?
I mean I kind of know why
But this is ridiculous
Itâ€™s so stressful itâ€™s literally almost a month until we r back
itâ€™s âœ¨rollingâœ¨
I gotta know how much I'm paying 🥺
The randomly generated emoji combination pngs are one of my favorite tbings
That of a nice neighbor you have who has a weirdly complicated history with Singapore and Niger but you donâ€™t mind it

I like ohio
inland state 💀
shoutout to lake erie for letting me pretend its not all the way inland
https://youtu.be/oZzgAjjuqZM?si=okQGEX5266L3QdB9
This is an important cultural relic
maxed out guitar center credit card vibes right here
lmaoo
mine was more than the SAI
about twice as much as the SAI 😃
does not like that i get out of classes at 3:05 on fridays
shuttle bus me
though personally id prefer to just fly tbh
its like $60 more expensive for a pretty large time cut
oh and for like thanksgiving or whatever
since we only get 3(?) days off for that
only thursday and friday
so two
for a total of 4. the same as fall break
yeah
it would literally just be me being home for a couple of dr appointments she scheduled for the same day
New name unlocked for cutler
Youâ€™ve heard of cutler???
Now get ready for culter
We have all your cults

People jokingly called the community of people that lived there â€œCultlerâ€ my year
Ah okay history repeats itself
I mean they should just officially rename it atp
Then boom culter is reborn
SHINE ON FOREVER
@michael_cjr I donâ€™t know if this is the sort of â€œlinguistics nerdâ€ stuff you were thinking of, but for some time I would simply refuse to use the letter â€œaâ€ when typing or texting ever
Thatâ€™s hardcore
Arabic is such a cool language in general
Not in // but in []
I just know that it has cool ways of creating nouns
Like how book is â€œkitabâ€ and library is â€œmaktabaâ€
They both have the â€œtabâ€ meaning book
Itâ€™s more cursed than that
The part that means â€œto readâ€ is k-t-b and the vowels between them change the meaning
Oh yeah no youâ€™re right
Yeah we had a "the cult" group chat lol
c.f. *s-l-m* "to submit" with Mu**sl**i**m** and I**sl**a**m**
General Population 🫡
But they will learn of my weirdness sooner than later
I need to come up with a funny name for Taplin
True
Ain't no way you're living in Tarlie Taplin
Any Raymond fans/haters in the chat
I was cool living anywhere other than Clarke
Lol same
I was so glad they gave me Smith after I failed to get a room during room selection
This is going well
We might have a the cult II
Tbh I drifted apart from most of them
I so wished I had lived in Cutler
Oh well go big or go home amiright
You were there often enough to be an honorary resident lol
😔
Iâ€™m forcing at least my floor to have game nights every week
I was a based Cutler 4 resident
What kind of games?
Board games, random stuff
Mario Kart
Wait what dorm are you in and can random extras join
Taplin 4th floor, and sure
Mario kart you say
Dude imagine 😭
My RA did not care, and I lived on the football floor
So the common room was always filled with people being rowdy!
I walked down there at 11 AM on a Saturday, and burger ingredients were strewn on the floor
I have no clue what the makeup of my floor is gonna be
Everything but meat and bun, including fries
I was on a very party floor
Me and u both I love Mario kart count me in
Board games you say 👀
If your floor mates are haters there's lots of people on campus who enjoy board games lol
Yeah everyone is invited to Taplin Mario Kart tournaments
^^^^^^^
Fuck yeah (<- this person has not played Mario kart in years)
I always fall off the track
Iâ€™m pretty decent
And the fisherman yellow guy looks at me like I'm pathetic
Losers bracket between you and me Jake
I have them
Sweet
Drunken chanting and singing!!!
New Jake lore just dropped???
Did Adam Hutchings (a) *like* this, or (b) *not like* this?
Ooh good guess though Charlie
Has anyone played ticket to ride 👀
Choose a friend!
There was a cohort of gentlemen on my floor who, instead of laughing when they found something funny in their drunken state, elected to bang on whatever door was closest to them. I was next to the common room
Hayley phoned in faster than you, and *wins today's contest*!
No what has axel gotten himself into now?
Yippee 😄
Adam do you have a picture of the opium den
Me too
Uhhh maybe?
You will this fall
Theta Chi "board game" nights are known to go multiple houes past their official ending time
And we have a room which has one or two board games in it
I might have a picture
Uhh can I get a 50/50 on this one
You have no choice in the matter
A few. Perhaps
Not as rusty as i thought for my first race in 2 months
Roll for initiative
My fraternity also enjoys some board games lol
Some people more than others
Yeah. Fish was in on that I think right?
I mean what else are you gonna do?
Fish played with them once
The guy who owned the game just graduated tho so we'll see what happens
I remember him planning for it lmao
You will learn at case
I sure hope so
Tragic
Of opium den?
Yeah
Are you sure this is not just the den
Maybe you did opium in the den
That has nothing to do with the name alright
Or had a highly legal poppy growing hustle there
The house is from the late 1800s okay? Times change
â€œI just like flowers, ok?â€
And bagels!!!
But West Coast erasure occurred 😔
East Coast >>>>>>
Hey if you wanna live their next year Iâ€™ll take the eigenspace
We will make a Mario kart player out of you
The residents of each Theta Chi room get to name their room
To the tune of "I'll make a man out of you" I'm assuming
Yes ofc
Mulan is the best Disney movie no I do not take criticism
â€œHey ladies, wanna come back to the eigenspace?â€
If you mean ticket to ride I will be bringing one
Good opinion
Ultimate rizz total player
No. We have a Few copies dw
cc @jschlanket
Linear algebra rizz
so will i
The eigenrizz
we can play double ticket to ride
Which one
standard us one
Ah I have Europe
slay
Thatâ€™s good variety
Gonna be maiden-less fr
Yes?
True
majoring in physics-math
🥺
dude this diffeq final is looking real rough
:newitemacquired:
Beautiful
Yâ€™all we also have door signs for our rooms
Anyone have any suggestions for a good decoration for The Eigenspace door
I was thinking a lowercase lambda
{v | Tv = Î»v} (no girls allowed)
Excyuse me
But its comedic effect
Lol that's pretty good
Slay
See Charlie gets it
Maybe some vector space contour maps?
Vector himself
OH YEAH
WITH DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE
Low key excited for linear algebra
Take it with Meckes
Make it high key
Itâ€™s a banger
Hmmmm

Everything is a vector space.
Should i get one of these for the dorm
Yes
me definining a negative cow
Yes, and Iâ€™m bringing a poster of Squidward looking through the Krusty Krab kitchen window for my dorm
What is the most epic dorm decor people have seen at case?
I had fun with Julia for 307
But it just worked better in my schedule than Meckes'
And Julia is my lovely major advisor

Regardless of if it's summer or winter I wear the same outfits
YEAH SAME OUTFIT GANG 🔥
Well
ive worn shorts like 3 times so far this summer
pants <3
You'll never see me outside in a t shirt or shorts
iâ€™ve worn pants so much this summer because iâ€™m not allowed wear anything else
lab grindset?
yeah
lab grindset always
so uh the rather opposite side of the workplace dress code spectrum
i must wear pants
if i'm not wearing at least 2 layers what's the point
i love wearing skirts but next sem iâ€™m gonna be in lab every weekday 💀
of course youâ€™re from California
fr
"hmm i wonder what i am gonna wear today. t-shirt and athletic shorts once again !!"
â€¦ why
i love being from a niche state because everywhere i go people tell me iâ€™m the first person theyâ€™ve met from my state
||What state||
thatâ€™s a fun secret
A wise man once said
rhode island right?
I will remind anyone who asks that I am NOT from socal OR the Bay Area
So I am niche in that way, an inland Californian
sry 💀
Wow sooooo niche
Just was curious if it was New Mexico or not lol
what state vibes do i have
i know what state youâ€™re from iâ€™m biased
New Jersey
😭
The other CWRU person I know from your state has very similar speech patterns to you, linguologist chiming in
So that one
who
The one that the other person from the same state as you is from
Jesse S. if you know him
no
do you know claire c
i know i know!!
I know of her and saw her in CC but I do not know her personally
yeah thats not surprising somehow
You has
wonder if youd find that we share speech patterns
Everyone at Case clocks my accent as NY or OH, which I take to mean I have a very â€œgeneral Americanâ€ accent
i think baltimore creeps in for me sometimes but rarely
when i was a kid people told me i had a german accent
whatâ€™s funny is growing up i decided i didnâ€™t like my moms accent
so i almost exclusively speak like my new jersey father
shout out to the lady in boston that thought my mom was from NY and not my grandfather who was born and raised in nyc. bc he has a new york jewish accent and not a stereotypical new york accent
I love linguistics polls
my grandfather has the same exact accent as bernie sanders
fun fact

Does he look like him too?
i mean theyâ€™re both old jewish men
my grandfather is only like 4 years younger than him
He should recreate the mittens pose

Very fun fact
theyâ€™re definitely both old jewish men
With the same accent
why am i singled out here
pls 😭
FIRST MESSAGE OF THE DAY
my new england comes out in the au sound
Actually I guess mine are slightly different
Based on Every Ohio Resident Ever, I imagine @jschlanket and @idkwutmyusernameis2931 to either have an extremely generic American accent or very strong Midwestern accent, no in between
@idkwutmyusernameis2931 is not a local, they are a poser
But i will not confirm or deny your thought
https://tenor.com/view/among-us-pote-kkt-vote-gif-19433421
You are like the proudest New Yorker I know
Why would you pronounce cotangent
I've no reason not to be
I give up
Oh I thought you two knew each other from high school or something
Now that I think of that I'm not sure where that came from
No I slept with his friend
(We shared a room for a flyin program)
Like were assigned one
But no homo if socks on
Ik and I told Ben id say this
Typing stops
i pronounce caught like cawt and cot like cot
This, this is correct
The Midwesterners I know who make the distinction say /kÎ±t/ for caught and /kat/ for cot
I say /kÎ±t/ for both
caught rhymes with bought and cot rhymes with bot
All four rhyme 🥰
see that i cannot see
wait until yall find out what i call a water fountain
What..
Do NOT say a bubbler
a bubblerâ€¦
WHY
itâ€™s how i was raised!!
iâ€™ve gotten better here around non-rhode islanders
itâ€™s kind of bubbled the bubbler right out of me
Good
but itâ€™s a bubbler :(
bubbler bubbler
Where are the bubbles
Unless that machine dispenses sparkling water I do not see a reason to call it that
New business idea?
New freshmen are not ready for the water fall vs new jersey vs orange county debate
Does anyone here call it an air sip
No one? Okay good
A what..?
I have decided to call it that as of this second
Ikr love me a good air sip
i think thatâ€™s fountain to me
Most people say waterfall. Many New Jersey people say air sip. And Orange County says birdie
i say fountain 💀💀
Do any of y'all say "drinking fountain"
For me, drinking fountain and water fountain are interchangeable
Water fountain is the only one Iâ€™ve heard
I used to when i was younger
Whyâ€™d you stop
I think they're interchangeable, but I default to water fountain
bubbler
bubbler!!!!
BUBBLER FOR THE WIN!!!
Wiscansin individuals
Omg bubbling, like that one Weezer song
not me
It does bring joy to the name
Water fountain
I mean hey at least I have Culver's and cheese
wisconsin 🤝 rhode island
                   bubbler
What is this sorcery
Do you
Do you not know what Culver's is
There is one culvers to my knowledge and its nowhere near case
WHAT IS THIS BLASPHEMY
One of my fraternity brothers works at Culver's and he has a little plushie in his car that he claims is "Curdis the Cheese Curd"
i know which one this is!!!
Culver Creek Preparatory High School
I think Curdis the cheese curd is being added to my list of potential dog names
This is a Culver's the greatest creation known to man home to custard and fried cheese curds
I do love culvers
D:
I thought it was a meme until I came to Ohio
The amount of trolling I dealt with because I was coming to school in Ohio
But we have In-n-Out (#1 burgers)
Bucees >>
The first time I ate a cheese curd was in salt lake city and it was kind of unpleasant
Yeah theres a few around but none near case
I saw some guys in buccees cosplay the other day
That is amazing

so cool
@jschlanket
take that back cheese curds are amazing they squeak in ur mouth and taste like joy
Halloween costume?
Nah I think they were just having fun
Yes totally
This was after I went to that concert
THEY WORE THAT TO PTV
Maybe salt lake city ones are just mid
I think that's prob why
The most new york moment I've had was eating my graduation dinner with a bunch of mobsters at a neighboring table
Come to Wisconsin I'll get u real cheese curds
If anyone ever wrongs Matthew even slightly you will see that he is really the mobster
I should attend a mosh pit in a bucees costume
That is a life goal
Tbh the first time I visited a buccees I kind of hated it
Extremely overstimulating
iâ€™m going to go to buccees when i go to texas
at some point
The best gas station ever
It's a really big gas station
To visit Goodman?
No that's kwik trip (pronounced quick trip)
â€œChain of convenience stores for snacks & drinks, plus eclectic themed T-shirts & knickknacksâ€
yes to visit Goodman
A Texas (mostly they are expanding) chain where everything is beaver themed
This is the mascot

Oooo it's themed
I just think they are amazing
he promised he would bring me to buccees
Get the beaver nuggets 🦫
Crazy to me that American culture is going to the gas station for fun
Yup
Itâ€™s Texas sized
They gotta scale it up bc it's from texas
THEN HOW BIG IS A WALMART IN TEXAS
hot NE take but cumberland farms >>>> 7 eleven
CUMBIES BELOVED
Wouldnâ€™t you like to know ohioian
CUMBIES <33
Also the Job Lot
Go back to los alamos and get nuked
Classic location
wait where are you from
sheetz sweeps a gas station contest any day tbh
But wb France?
NYC, but my dad's from the south shore and my grandparents live there
ahhh
Later
Wld you rather get me or France
If you keep being mean, you
What did I do??
You could also just set the rest of nm on fire
my mother is a mostly french rhode islander and my father is a bergen county jew
Wildfire II
Slainte
And blow up the meth labs in abq
Those explosions would be cool
True
🔥Arson🔥
Lmao understandable, quality boyfriend time
You and alex will get along then
My favorite hobby
>:3
i refuse to go any time but the winter
itâ€™s too warm for me iâ€™ll wilt
Maybe there can be some peace between math and nursing
That is a smart move
Is he planning to visit Cleveland when he can? I figure
heâ€™ll visitâ€¦ for commencement
Not sure if winter is much better, havent they had once in a lifetime winter storms the past 3 years
Burn the landscape the way it was for millennia
Safe version of pyromania
and works 6 days a week, 12-13 hour days
Shhhh a is for arson b is for barson and c is for commit arson
Dude what 😭 his workers rights are being abused
I love bonding over shared interests
I remember being young too
Arson â¤ï¸
But now that I'm older I prefer safer ways of satisfying my desire to watch things burn. Like watching some of my brothers try to cook
Free comedy?
Is he at least making bank?
yeah dw about him
Lowkey I personally have a big rational fear of fire
Ik very arson poser of me

I like to sit in front of the fire place in the winter and just stare
Very therapeutic
Smh not even a real pyromaniac, it's people like you who are ruining the fandom
itâ€™s ok bc in a couple years ill probably be working almost as much as him making about a third of what he makes because
grad student vibes

Cool bonfire
No, it's a dig against you specifically being from the East Coast
Ough fire
Don't worry 🥰
iâ€™m in cleveland rn
ive been in cleveland since may 26
DU moment
Truly
Btw
Wha
But I'm in Colorado now
Pretty high
100%
Little factoid for ya, most flights heading to Colorado end up in Colorado
That was the question
Not the chances of ending up in Colorado
Yeah lol no I was not clear
Are we sure colorado is real?
No
Itâ€™s gentrified nm
@cawu is Colorado real
But it does have good hiking
I was gonna say its wyoming with snow but that works too
And made south park
What is the least real state?
Ohio
True
This may be controversial, but I don't think south park is really that good of a show
Florida
Also true
Delaware
Pennsylvania
itâ€™s obvious west virginia
Alaska
william penn <3
New Hampshire
All these responses are very valid

Gl
Congrats. Welcome to the best state
Colorado's not *real???* Is my whole life a lie??
So true :)
Am sitting
Itâ€™s always been fake
...
What about where I am now? I this place real?
That is the *real* question
I think we should call in our resident philosopher
@hicinserenomen
Depending on your answer here this could be really funny
1 month until move in
Oi oi oi
ya girlie's now a certified cwru tour guide :xl_blush: 
so everyone should book a campus tour **now**

How your backwards walking??
so it's improving....
Slowly but surely
Soon youâ€™ll be a pro
And have a very cool skill to flex
"my special party trick is that i can walk backwards super fast"
Well congrats you have much to be proud of: getting published AND featured, being a certified tour guide and having the best endless emote supply
:christmaspepeyayayaya: :froggie_shocked: :chubby_bow:
thank uuu <333 so sweet
Also, if my memory serves me correctly you also are getting into slipknot (bonus points)
yes indeed that was also me~ :duckheh:
FR LMAOOO
Slipknot is the most important accomplishment here
And like, the other stuff I guess
From a philosphical view is colorado real? Is any place really real?
But no, Colorado is fake
It would give you a heck of a lot of philosophy to ponder
(The views I've just expressed are contentious and very much not held by everyone)
It's more of a novelty to me
but they are the objectively best
How's that
to spite those from colorado and because it is a funny bit
maffer
*maffew
Hallo Linzer
:exitpepe:
incredibly so


Cause fall break
On thanksgiving 💀

Sometimes the port into calendar has mistakes
like how it puts all of your classes as being on the first day of class

yeah none of the freshman dorms have ac
make sure you have a fan in your dorm
if you have any sort of medical condition that can you can remotely benefit from having an ac talk to ur doctor
yeah
but if you ever wanna stay a summerâ€¦ a big reason why people pay more for summer housing is AC
Why do they just not equip the buildings with AC
The dorm buildings are really old
It would also be labor intensive and since people live in on campus housing over the summer there isn't a great time to do it
It was 50-60 during fall??
In spring, and F not C
i swear it was higher than that in fall
I mean I'd hope or you'd be melting
It was 44 C here a few days ago 🙂
i remember my room kept getting up to 90 and i had to sleep on top of my blanket
Oh wow
Yeah
You will be fiiiiine
Just get a good coat and nice warm pants and a hat, and you will be chilling
counterpoint: washington
then snow 😭
actually now that i think harder about it, counterpoint rescinded
you're right
clarke tower 9th floor just holds heat very well
atypical experience
Thats the fun part, you may even experience rain while the sun is shining
Eh, it's more tame here than in CO I think
I'm currently in Colorado 😎
ooh where?
Were you not here for the tornado warning and intense rains in August?
Ok yes, but when I went home over spring break, I spent the first three days backpacking and it was lovely, and the next few days in snow at least up to my waist. All of it was awesome.
I recall, it's certainly wild. I'm generally not a fan of calling things or people "so bipolar" though. Just my op onion
Very in touch with nature
Yeah, I did not
This is what I mean by deep snow
What do Ohioans call this term
In California we call it a sunny shower
we call it the average day
But I think sunshower is decent
Mass also has very inconsistent weather - honestly more so I would say than Ohio

"JOB" all caps
Waka waka eh eh
the nursing grindset (I do not see myself going to grad school sooner than 5 years after I get my bsn)
anyone want anatomy fun fact
Sure
its called the ligamentum arteriosum
but what it IS, is the remnant of a bonus blood vessel you have as a fetus
Do you ever get floaters
Too often
I always just assume Iâ€™m going blind
Real
Honestly that is pretty cool
:0 that's so cool
Human development is super fascinating
yes exactly
If we're sharing anatomy facts the liver regenerates
the more yk
But only once bc it regenerates from stem cells in the liver
So no infinite liver glitch
Sight is for nerds
If we're sharing anatomy facts, it is possible to learn to make your pupils dilate at will
Iâ€™ll blindfold you in an er then
I should do that and then try to stick an iv in you :)
So true
I just have the sensation of needles
But I love needles
true
I was super super obsessed with anatomy when I was like 6
nice
exactly :/
love my tarsals and meta-tarsals and carpals and meta-carpals and phlanges
Why tf do we have toes
that is a great question
Look at horses
They have no toes
Or 1 toe ig
you may not be but I am
But horses are so fucked up
certified horse hater
And it's bc they have 1 toe
Horses are not fucked up, theyâ€™re awesome
There is an excellent climbing tree next to the freshman dorms
||where||
Sounds like a nice study spot ngl
But theyâ€™re so cute
🤨
wait extra good bc all 3 could fit up there??
It is a vast one
something right out of the hobbit fr
We should try to get as many people as possible up inti that tree
It'd be enrichment
I like how you think
fosho enrichment time
thats banned??
It's got a lot of vertical space and some pretty good horizontal too
darn there goes my strategy
I have a picture of 5 of us up there
Yeah â€¦ safety concerns grumble grumble
Omg share
Vietnam flashbacks
D:
And the other 4 people, 3 of whom are in this server
@hellspells we will just have to make our own picture
Thereâ€™s some good trees on the quad as well
how long does a response to a permission request take :/
for me 1-3 days
Depends on the professor you are requesting
yes
Go to the freshman dining hall
QED
just put them all through a hydraulic press
That tree - itâ€™s not my favorite but itâ€™s a good one
You fit the population of interest then!
then see the carrying capacity of tree and stack them
Itâ€™s like a square-packing problem but for humans in a tree
Make sure not to break the branches of that tree though
At least the Theta Chi house has a view of the tree so I can watch as you all play human Wood Leaf Jenga
you should host a watch party fr
does cwru have a hydraulic press for completely moral and ethical science experiments
Sell ppv
I will, in fact, have been 20 for fewer than 20 days during O-week, so I can host a party for all the non-teens to watch as I do not fit the study criteria

I know I know, I'm old
which spongebob character would u be
The strings on the guitar (I climb)
Iâ€™d just be one of the random background fish
gary
guitarist?
finding the perfect emoji is an art
and alex is just lurking
Ironic
hi alex

always
Actual picture of me btw
You are not a math major (I have made up my mind)
the oracle has spoken â€¼ï¸ 🗣ï¸
I have met Michael in real life (this picture is correct)
Im waiting for people to count
So i can test things
I think ur pfp is a better description
this fish looks like the one in all the yelling gifs
The Lego photo that I took literally two years ago
yes
wait you took that??
Yeah
The Lego photo is so you that at this point I think â€œMichaelâ€ and my mind auto fills to â€œred yellow purple brownâ€
woah
Red and brown definitely, idk about yellow and purple
Yellow from the Lego figure and purple from the 28 role
yello from bric, purpl from inferiority
I have a MASSIVE Lego collection, itâ€™s a problem
Problem not detected
$$$$$$$$
Problem not detected
I second this
Opinions on dnd Lego?
that's a thing?
I think it looks awesome
whaat

All a man yearns for in life
WHAT
I'm heading to the ATM rn
Man is simple
Man see dnd lego set man say hell yeah
see lego, buy lego, build lego, play lego
Other fav is this ninjago one from years ago
(Heâ€™s a ninjago fan)
DID SOMEBODY SAY NINJAGO
JUMP UP KICK BACK WHIP AROUND AND SPIN

I have the old Death Star form when I was little
NO WAY
woah
Should put that thing in a museum case
But also whereâ€™s the fun in that
By dream is to buy a brand new one
would be cool to have legos in your dorm
Ground
You could constantly step on legos too
A small price to pay for Lego
Sounds like a plan
â€¦
A lil??
not all of them are face up
when u spill a box of 500
THUMBTACKS?
U alright???
I'm here now
Thatâ€™s good (donâ€™t ask how you made it through)
band aids, kleenex, not telling mom
My dream is to have an entire room in my house dedicated to legos
and alot of peroxide
sounds possible
future lego club president right here
how would it be organized
we should make this happen
like by series/type of set?
the club very much exists
but mikey for lego pres 2025-8
we must stage a takeover
A coup of lego club
I humbly accept this nomination
great I'll start working on the campaign
There would be sections of shelves, one for each theme
ah
u in?
tru
nice
Weâ€™ll get a grant from the university, just to buy sets
have you perchance visited a legoworld
that's wishful, I was thinking of a gofundme
I have not
its for student wellbeing
Its actually diversity and inclusion too
everyone can bond over lego
say its required material for modeling systems
There are different colors of minifigures too
fr
you should if you get the chance
highly reccomend the one in san diego
but okay the point is they have these lego themed hotel rooms
wait I though Legoland was SD and Legoworld was OR
The next time I go to Disney world Iâ€™ll give it a visit
castle>>>
my friend has the whole harry potter hogwarts collection
it's massive
My prized possession is the 2008 battle of Endor set
woaj
so my question is
is this the general house decor



yeah castle looks better
yes but also that was unfair of me to diss pirates
memory bias
it is also pretty darn cool
my cousins fav was definitely pirates
and I have a castle bias so
could that be funded to stay at a certain place
is this fancy legoland
Yes
A place everyone should visit
A pilgrimage
I've been to the Florida one
Had circumstances with homelife been better I might actually remember my visit
@hellspells you love arson, i love arson, how about starting a pyrotechnics club? I dont think the university would have a problem with that at allllll
I would love to
We could set fire to so many things
We could do colored fires
A new color each week
Yesssss
Itd be educational too bc chemistry
May help me in my chem class
I see what you are UP to non mullet Mr white
Fr
What chem are yall taking
111
105
btw drew meyer blows up balloons on the first day of chem
Do khan academyâ€™s ap chem stuff maybe
Not sure
Chem is definitely a learning curve
Actually thatâ€™s a good idea
What I did before ib chem
Now I get to have my chem knowledge wilt until the spring
you know there's one in columbus right?
LEGOLAND??
it's like a 2hr drive away but definitely doable for a day trip
No way
FIELD TRIP

~~I convieniently googled legoland locations and the columbus one came up~~
there's also an adult night event for 25 bucks october 23rd
So that is where all of Greek life goes for their retreats right?
I've been meaning to make a pilgrimage there at some point, I'll probably go during discover week tbh
THATS WHAT IM SAYING
generally we just go to the farm, but I can certainly put in the suggestion
the best one (only one i have been close to ever entering)
I went once as a kid and do not understand the hype
I think I might've been once
i bought a keychain at the store there once
easton build a bear on top though
wait I actually might have a decorative brick from one
wait where are you from?
Cleveland
ooohhh
my brain went wait another columbus person
clevelands cool I guess :(
My uncle lives in columbus so sometimes we go down there and visit and stuff
Any PA friends?
columbus cool
hey, my choice was cleveland or columbus and I chose cleveland
so like, you win at least that fight
what're the odds I know your uncle
euclid > high street any day
so true!
Minor detail
Probably low theres a lot of people in Columbus
~~I do not know this is true~~
If I had even thought of going to OSU my town would disown me
are you from lansing or something?
South-central Pennsylvania, Penn State territory
well actually
i-o
as you should, thank you
all you out of staters better learn that trick
WE ARE
i am legally obligated
True its a requirement
and then you know who the best people in that room are
ohio supremacy
Pennsylvania is so nice
i need to actually spend time in pennsylvania
only ever driven through it
I've spent a decent amount of time there, and tbh western PA is just ohio with extra steps
now eastern PA is a different ballgame
The whole state is just Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, the most bankrupt state capital, and a bunch of mountains and forests
?
We have a bunch of farming
well anyways
You not like Ohio but thumbs up Ohio supremacy
We can farm harder
We have the best of Ohio, Maryland, New York, and New Jersey all in one state
My opinion on ohio changes on the daily
Well we have the Amish
do you have a field full of concrete statues dedicated to a single crop
Just like the weather
â€¦â€¦?
*drops mic* walks off stage
We have the amish too
Ours are better
untrue we have the best of the amish. Der Dutchman, basically entire counties dedicated to excellent amish furnature
my hometownâ€™s landmark
ohio >>
I will visit this beautiful landmark someday
Lancaster is Amish mecca
the field of corn is a beautiful landmark
Pennsylvania will always be the better state, no changing my mind
I think I've been to the field of corn exactly once
der dutchman servers with the pioneer cosplays my beloved
ohio better
pennsylvania has wawa right
my friends always rave about it
Yep, mainly in the East
my hometowns landmark is the site of the deadliest fireworks accident in U.S. history
(for legal reasons, I am only having this debate ceremonially, you are entitled to your own opinions)
that's fine, why would we want to go that direction anyway?
who else but ohio has a river catch on fire
twice
don't forget about the war we won against Michigan (territory)
@jschlanket we should set a river on fire if we start a pyrotechnics club
Love my city
kinda miffed that searching up my town pops up with a bridge instead of the mighty field of corn now :/
YES 3RD CUYAHOGA RIVER FIRE
If anyone wants to hear random ohio facts, keep me posted
At least we were one of the original colonies
cuyahoga river for the win
(itâ€™s a cool bridge i walked across it the other night)
Susquehanna >>>
yeah, means you only had the one war fought over you (and a bunch of other territories), ohio had 3 (to my knowledge) fought over only it...
maybe plan your domestic terrorism after you get on campus
Did it catch on fire tho?
I live right by Gettysburg, the largest battle fought on American soil
Nah it just floods over constantly
"4 score and...
i live near the birthplace of superman
Hell yeah
you know what I respect the hustle
slight delay
we unifying the nation over here
that is fair. please consider that ohio has an entire city named after a singular court house that had a battle take place around it
wait why is that such a signficant drop
just racking up questionable acts huh
oh wait bus vs car probably
Yeah
We have the liberty bell too, the most fragile piece of metal ever
tyler if we start now weâ€™ll be on campus in 17 hours if we bike
what if scooter
exactly
wait alex, if you're okay answering are you in the city or suburbs?
ahh
icic
bestie unless you're bike is going 70 up 71 I think I'm faster
like 8 years?
no better time than rn
Woahg that's a long time
what did they do to you?
but as a future ed nurse, head safe
that made sense the first time
😔 I do wear the helmet but I will complain about it
as you should
YES
they really should make those in adult sizes
major untapped market right there
https://www.99bikes.co.nz/cdn/shop/products/RaskullzZebraMohawkWhiteChildHelmet2.jpg?v=1613334433&width=1200
and youd gain sm street cred
most badass helmet to exist
Go around wearing one of those and you'll be the baddest bitch around
Shhhhh they have no proof
Trueeee
no more perfect contraption has ever been forged
extra safety feature for late night scooter runs
trueee
what is the thinkbox meant for if not to create these helmets for adult heads
You're a genius
We'll just grab some unsuspecting engineering major to build it for us
Would love to see this come to life
10/10 would wear
ultimate swag unlocked
the armor probably has good stats too
op armor tbh

Man y'all are going to have so much fun at Case
remember that day when it was like 70 in the morning and snowed in the afternoon
least absurd Ohio weather

Does this ping everyone 😭
No just the person who made the poll
the best day of the academic year is the first snow
there could be 5 snowflakes and people will jump at the chance to build their first snowman
Iâ€™ll be one of them
How are they different to you?
But more importantly: Justice cameo
That's actually what those grills are for
So the imposter can vent
Smh
rememeber folks, ALWAYS raise your hand and ask your professor if you can go to the restroom, especially if it's a big lecture hall, the professors care a lot about attendance and you might get an infraction if you don't ask â€¼ï¸
Stop messing with them lol
Cot is pronounced cot and caught is pronounced cawt

they both rhyme with ought, as in â€œi ought to stop procrastinatingâ€

Cot = caught
His caught is a little farther back
i suppose
this is a banger picture
little guy !!
my artist rendition
omgg
amazing
Did he just get a box and start collecting phones around the room
He got envelopes
And made us put our phones in the envelopes
And we would take them out when class was over
That might even be more crazy😭😭
Wym you gave everyone an envelope just for phones lol
Coat is pronounced coot
Cot is cot and caught is caut
Not to be Mr. Linguologist but are your parents from Ohio
Because generally Midwesterners* have more front vowels â˜ï¸🤓
Mom yes, dad mystery
Alright

Trick question, neither
As in you hear me saying them â€œthe right wayâ€ or are both of them just in between
I hear them both the right way
Letâ€™s GO
BANGER DRAWING
Cwru squirrels are just built different
Howd it go?
(Squirrels do not carry rabies)
maybe tossing nuts in its general direction would work? kinda like ducks??
when did you get on campus?

34.9K is scaring me
icic
my four year advisor decided to quit lmao
huh
im sorry, hopefully you'll get a new one quickly
@jschlanket @michael_cjr are either of you going to take the Putnam this year
It's a cool math contest
Also Dr Pepper is mid
You can, trust
Carbonated cough syrup
12 questions, each one is worth 10 points
Median score is typically 0-1 points
Oh itâ€™s for undergrads, honestly that might be fun
Will consider
Is there a CWRU team?
Itâ€™s literally just carbonated cough syrup
Would not recommend
what do you recommend
Extremely unpopular take when itâ€™s the second best selling soda in the country
that's the exact reason why it's good
Literally anything else
I have basically no classes
it was designed to taste like how drinking from those rusty water fountains in those old playgrounds felt
what kind of upbringing did you have bro
A normal American one 😂
suburban
bro has tetanus in his veins
nice to see a comp e major though
absolutely
on both counts
It builds character
my good friend is comp e and I helped him choose that
who else is gonna engineer computers
exactly
Oh yes
dr pepper is peak
Whats your favorite soda then
Real
peak
Iâ€™m American, Mountain Dew
Okay i still like you
mountain dew is second
ah I see
I'm gonna try some
root beer is objetively the best
Which root beer is the best out of the big three? Barqs, a&w, or mug
but which root beer is the question
mug
the best root beer is atlantic brewing company this small company based in bar harbor maine
im not picky when it comes to second best
i mean ofc the small companies are peak
Iâ€™ve pretty much eliminated soda from my diet, but there are other things keeping me from looking like an Adonis
Small brewing company root beer is always amazing, its like a cheat code
ikr
Mug
Monster is amazing tho
Sounds like you could use a mtn dew during orientation
â˜¹ï¸
3rd party companies are less washed down I agree
monster looks carcinogenic
but tbh everuthing is
Forcing me to drink soda
@idkwutmyusernameis2931
but it just looks more carcignogenic
Oh it is, thatâ€™s what makes it amazing
On my trial list: Carbonated cough syrup, cancer
peer pressure before we even on campus
that too for drinks
lmao
True
if you had to bathe in soda, what soda would you choose
hey I have not had an energy drink in like 2 months, I am the picture of health
prob one of the obscure healthy brands
lmao valid
would seltzer count? (its cheating)
like ollipop or something like that
yeah okay
Ew flavored water is gross
Mtn dew because i might dissolve
Itâ€™s for science
honestly I dropped sofa and now I have coffee regularly
like black coffee
coke prob better for that
wait I'm a caffiene addict
as a good thing?
No, just for science
that's good, don't
Woah woah woah says who
what do you indulge in michael
lego
Monster and Taco Bell
not very tasty
taco bell is nice
And too much Sheetz
wait, lego pfp gone??
Now itâ€™s baby me, with Lego
ah gotcha
what is this switch your pfp friday??
Everybody needs a new profile
Your turn
wait tyler's pfp goes so hard I just noticed it
staying consistent over here
So Iâ€™m dropping out, actually
peer pressure amiright
bro got his priorities straight
wait this reminds me to do the anti hazing module
thanks
I'm classless
thanks for reminding me in return
no broplem
I did the hazing one and then stopped midway through the drinking one, it was too funny
â€œDouble woahâ€
drinking up grades down!!
hopefully.
And then youâ€™ll commit crimes and get somebody pregnant
yes exactly
a fundemental law of the universe
wait is there a taco bell near case??
that is what im gathering
how could they
https://tenor.com/view/cry-gif-23674110
bankruptcy here i come
what if I just quiero taco bell??
not that that statement is true
would have to agree
also true
there is a good boba tea place also right next to it
yep
whoa
squirt a lil into my eyes to keep them from closing
I'd make better for cheaper
true, better with scooter and awesome helmet
Hayleys cookies??
im literally going to go bankrupt
Iâ€™d walk that gladly
Yeah I'll make yall cookies if u can get me the ingredients

Collective birthday party?
All this talk about cookies is so funny bc I'm actually making cookies rn

I wanna eat the cookie dough
Matcha flavored â‰ï¸
Have yall ever had edible cookie dough, it
It's the best
Yeah u know it 😉
have no idea what to do
onto something
Actually there's a bigger risk with raw flour for e coli so u gotta bake the flour before u use it too to make edible cookie dough
the more you know
may just let people plan for me

L, ur evil
https://tenor.com/view/heinz-doofenshmirtz-content-gif-26874036

Hey dont try and slander me for enjoying something cool
Hey fire is cool

One of us
Wonderful! We have our 3rd member of the pyrotechnics club
Fire is too hot for me
true
That's tragic man
i just like burning things
my room is freezing, it's the only way I can sleep
i like watching them curl up and char
I do like setting sticks on fire and waving them around like wands
Itâ€™s so fun and cool to watch
10/10 experience
let me guess what nation you guys would be part of in avatar???
Not sure you could guess
Me neither
Ik ur gonna say fire but jokes on u I'm water nation
ik I might be stumped
absolutely the best
I love waterbending so much
Like could you potentially waterbend any liquid
dr pepper bending
I was thinking more if liquid metals would fall under water or earth
Liquid metal is still metal itâ€™s earth for sure
perhaps
are there any ovens at case for hayley's baking?
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ but it's liquid and is it possible to earthbend liquid?
ovens in the communal kitchens on the first floor
Nice
I see, do people clean up or is it usually in shambles
This is perfect
^
true just uh uwc kitchen expierences
>:3 ill just pay my way through college by baking stuff for people lol
D:
an expierence and a half
Full-time job
because fun fact you had to walk through that room to get to the dorm rooms
If I can find the pictures then I'll send cakes I've made for my birthdays
I mean I'm planning on building a full commercial kitchen in my dorn so we could set up in there
single handedly puts insomnia out of business
where will the legos go??

JESSE! WE NEED TO COOK
I might just rent out the whole floor
minus the rice cooker 😪
Now im craving cake
>:3
that is so impressive??
😮
My mom and older sister make nicer ones but I try
best type of cookie?
Chocolate chip it's a classic
Snickerdoodle
chocolate chip without the chocolate chips >>>>
YES EXACTLY
That would be my 2nd favorite
chocolate chip (and chocolate in general) is so overrated
Also this lemon one I did 2 or 3 years ago
wild statement
hi shrey I cannot thank you enough for helping me get one class
Lemonnnn my favorite
truth can be unsettling sometimes
😭 np but also u wouldve gotten it eventually tbh
very clucth and helpful
I love lemon so much I'm a whore for lemon flavored stuff
I agree with the truth
are you saying this just to be argumentative?
sugar cookie
specifically from insomnia
I'll make u a better one
pls do so
ginger bread
😟
cookie divdes all
shrey is a insomnia hater??
clearly
not politics not religion, cookies
insomnia is peak
Wowwwww
same
im making you try both
I mean its on campus
they give out free ones during o week
i think?
why was this not mentioned sooner
If they do then Iâ€™ll gladly try
homemade is prob better
(thats how they get ppl hooked)
https://tenor.com/view/hold-up-hold-up-meme-fallout-meme-gif-3737350009659669155
Homemade can always be better
i might be lying mybe its spring only and im giving u all false hope
same
~~what if you say its ur bday~~
I tried crumbl once, was good but definitely overrated
crumbl is more dependent on flavors they have
that'll change soon once we get to campus
not one nearby
nvm
ah
I think I most excited for the den
mostly bc of its name
and it looks like a metal burrito
yom
yo the spongebob thing is so hype
insomnia is overpriced asf
Snickerdoodle i hear
cookies
as always
we may get a free insomnia cookie during o week
no turns out i was lying 😔
^^
Cookies
chopsticks
teleport to wisconsin
ez
Yeah it's just an 8hr drive from cleaveland
guys I done goofed
Ofc Culver's is better here
only hayley can determine
I'll go to Culver's tmr and yall can live through me
I should go to culvers, its been a while
CULVERS
I LOVE
Finished cookie 😄
yep, the whole addition on teh marketplace
agreed
would rather swipe into dining hall and nab sugar cookies
or just like eat a healthier diet lmao
fribley chocolate chip >>>
Impossible challenge
Bibimbop chopsticks build the pho
def not at calorie western
Calorie western 💀💀
yeah bibibop is cheap and is good for fulfilling craving specifically for fake asian food
walking around campus to get to places will burn off some calories but the availability of high calorie food was pretty insane lol
very true
random anatomy fact time?
Yes
Interesting
indeed
Your small intestine is fuzzy on the inside
as it should be
thats lowk weird to think abt
yes I try not to
also they call a bypass after a heart attack a "cabbage" because the surgery's initials are CABG
I'm glad everyone is thoroughly disturbed by this fact : D
mission = successful
Iâ€™m not
Try again
Based
The top layer of ur skin gets replaced about every month and your skin has 3 layers and the top layer of the skin is 5 layers so 7 layers of skin total
This is less disturbing
agreed
https://www.usab.com/teams/5x5-mens-olympics/roster
and if u dont take care of it u can have more than 7 layers
human muscle is similar to pork texture wise
Speaking of muscles the mentalis muscle (chin) connects bone to skin unlike most muscles which is why when u flex ur chin it makes a bunch of weird dimples

ok thats cool
Ikr!!!
ur immune system does not know ur eyes exist
and if it does it will carry out the same immune response that it does with foreign pathogens
Woahg
Have u ever seen a diagram with just the brain and eyes?

yep lmao
have u seen the brain w cranial nerves attached?
😟
No but I'm invested now
go indulge urself
Okay maybe that wasnâ€™t a very â€œfunâ€ fact actually
no thats interesting tho
OH heres an actual fun one
when u blush
Wait omg that's actually so interesting looking hold up
8 bars after freshman Adam attended Hellâ€™s Fried Chicken
HAHAHAHAHAHA
right??
I love anatomy
u can survive w just one lung
lol
We humans are built very poorly and I think it's hilarious
wait i think i heard of that
my body structure is especially prone to backaches too
cuz of the way i stand
😭😭
oh herex something i remember that i enjoyed learning
Omg I know that fact
osteoBlasts make new bone tissue while osteoClasts dissolve bone to help with growth
If the osteoblasts go out of control then u can get excess bone growth and it's super painful
now in the average human being there are hormones inhibiting osteoclast activity
estrogen and testosterone
We've found the homo habilis descendants
More things about hormones and bones is that women in menopause are more likely to develop osteoporosis bc of lowered estrogen production
and so a woman post-menopause will be more prone to smaller fractures
bc osteoclasts go into overdrive
yeah
We're on the same wavelength rn it's crazy
theyre not lying
their bones r actually so weak that just falling down right will create fractures
Gosh don't u just love what awaits us when we get old
this is why imma look for estrogen supps when im older
or testosterone
Hopefully research on women's bodies are better by the time we're old 🙏
with the way politics r going i doubt theres gonna be any funding that goes towards that within the next decade at least
LMAOOO
project 2025â€¦.
Bc I was like "universal healthcare pls"
And the answer is yes
money is the second biggest reason lol
but not big enough to overpower the first
But that was just such a crazy question to be asked
I think about it way too much
if you were a nurse, and your training and the current healthcare system was designed to keep people medicated and not get better, would you still be a nurse?
yes
because at least i know ways to not keep people on meds
so i have the power to help them get rid of the problem they came in with
We'd simply get the power and authority needed to get them off mess if it's hurting them
nurses are trained to follow doctrine, what made you choose it over PA, physician, research, etc where you get control over how medicine operates (not shooting down nurses btw, just want to know why our paths are different)
if i become np i also get power to direct where meds go
and thats my goal
respectable
Bc it puts me in patient contact and I think the patients are the most important
emergency department nurse practitioner
no matter what it takes
Wow I wanna be a nurse anesthetist
the reason why i chose nursing over other professions was because of patient contact
Nursing also gets you started way earlier too
And if u get ur cna then ur in the patient care settings quick
being able to provide emotional support and physical support when approved was very appealing to me
oh also
nursing is flexible
which also sounds appealing to me and is the reason why im going for a business minor
And if u end up not liking nursing it's easy to switch to it
My mom does it and she knows nurses that have switched to it
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!!!
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva??!?!
I mean yeah but it can also happen in smaller amounts

Capital one discover 1st financial

People r tryna blame embiid
That's embarrassing
i should prolly do that
This is not financial advice. But. 

If you are able to be consistently responsible with it (ie: use it like a debit card/pay it off in full every month) opening a credit card at 18 is a good financial move. 

You get great fraud prevention compared to debit cards, you earn points on all your purchases and you can start building your credit score early which is very helpful.
Ahead of ya
It's better for me to have one than not
Credit cards are basically necessary in the modern world
based on me and my parents' experience its free money if u pay everything on time
â€œIf you pay the money then itâ€™s freeâ€ is a wild take
this is in the context of getting rewards points i think
Ah that makes sense yes
(Not sarcastic my brain was just not parsing)
i love credit card rewards
so recently i redeemed about $90 in rewards for $105 in gift card
big win
My first credit card was at chase and I got a 3.9k limit and I could actually get hella rewards to fund my ubereats addiction
'nother win??

Percent of this server's total sent messages, by major

More than 25% of the messages are from 8 people, beautiful
Yk what sounds like a lot of fun? Poli/Anthro/Math
This says a lot about society
I know we joke about it a lot, but we just are active on the server, and a lot of people have to take math but very few of them are actually math majors, so we just love having more friends to share the love of math with â¤ï¸
Itâ€™s like how nursing majors share fun anatomy facts but any similarly fun math fact requires wayyy too much background
Free food???
hold on a sec
same
math can be beautiful

nobody here likes stats
stats made me depression
I'm gonna ignore you said that

The salt shaker knows its worth
freshmen are getting the princess treatment because cwru just installed new laundry machines in all of the residence halls
I genuinely have no clue what this means😭😭
Did you not have them before??
Where did you do your laundry?
we had them before
but they were old
Oh wait. Were they just old
they just replaced all of them
Also quick question, how many machines are there per building?
:0 guys were so special we get mini fridges and washing machines that work
all but clarke have 3 washers three dryers i think
itâ€™s not enough fyi
You were being sabotaged lol
just donâ€™t do your laundry on the weekends and itâ€™ll be fine
Got it. Do them at 2 am on Wednesdays
usually you have access to the other buildings in your community
yeah
Do they take long to repair it?
kinda
so i just did my laundry elsewhere for the rest of the semester
Epic
Let me break it down for you
https://tenor.com/view/hella-mad-breakdance-cool-lit-gif-13584980
highly recommend learning to line-dry your clothes from the balconies
it'll also make great exposition for your next indie film!
WHAT
honestly i always did weekends and it was emptier than weekdays
i think people try to hard to avoid "popular" times to do laundry that suddenly the machines are free when youd expect them to be busiest and vice versa
iâ€™m a morning on the weekends kinda gal
I wonder how it works with scrubs
Free mini fridges new washers
:Pepe_Pray:
thank u
i think so
it'd be weird having BBP risks brought back home for soiled laundry. But with all the organics and carcinogens brought back by chem lab students it probably wouldnt matter to our health anyways lol
No worries
also DCM and certain organic comps readily bypass through nitrile gloves, so yall have fun in Ochem lab (/s just dont let it stay on you too long and wash hands properlry)

Red would have been your best sandwich artist fr
why they call it sandwich artist
Good question
Itâ€™s crazy thatâ€™s the official name
No but itâ€™s your *creation*
Well it's not like art is always drawing so ig sandwiches count as art
ig
Goody aaah
Man
Fs
When my topical professor is reading the essay I write an hour before the deadline and needed to reach the word count
So in summary many may not consider sandwich making an art
And to me sandwich making is a meditative craft
Fr :/
sandwich making is art sometimes
Depends on the topic
True
And personally
Especially not on a movie
😟
brother eugggggggg
depends on which history
Also true
who would write 10 pages for a movie
I just enjoy saying that bc my dad teaches the subject to hs students
but not even i could write 10 pages on history and i love most history subjects
Typically I love history but that teacher was
Crazy
Depends on the movie â€¦

Do people live in Pennsylvania???
No just pencils
Only the Amish
the midwest is a mysterious place
What a coincidence
Including PA, which as Michael will tell you is a very firmly Midwestern state
Weâ€™re the most midwestern East Coast state
Geographically, no. Culturally, thatâ€™s up for debate
🤨
We have 23% of the US Amish population
im probably one of like 4 cwru students from south carolina
amish population  â‰  midwest
Thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m saying
Iâ€™m saying that a lot of the state looks more towards Ohio culturally than to other eastern states

Well it can be meant in a good way or a bad way
Based on what Michael has said about the school board in his area â€¦
I mean Iâ€™d love to completely forget that I went to that high school, but also Iâ€™m just excited to be independent and away from my parents
getting away from home is nice
but yk

If youâ€™re comfortable sharing, was it just like a quite rural area or is it like that in general in the region
Well South-Central PA is super conservative in general
i got many
And some school districts locally have been hiring this one conservative Christian law firm in order to push their agendas
high school trauma bonding!!!
My high school was mostly good, but in 2018 a girl in a neighboring high school baked her grandmotherâ€™s ashes into cookies and distributed them to kids. People I met in EUROPE had heard of this story
I
what.
While the high school is actively falling apart
i love when schools decide to put more funding into sports while the arts department gets like $2
New stadium, turf practice fields, a field house, for a school with 500 students total
sheesh
:0
And a coach being paid $200K?
Support the arts amiright
The only experience I have with turf is marching band competitions, and the quality varies wildly- theyâ€™re either carpets or pretty good approximations of grass
And they always give you turf turds in your shoes
turf causes more non contact injury
Water constraints?
my school is putting a turf football field and a new library
i mentioned my concerns and they were like â€œtheyâ€™ll be fineâ€
Skull emoji
True
So, for a variety of reasons, I am very excited to get out of here
Almost 26 dayzzz
A wild Alex has appeared??
excited but nervous at the same time

love going to schools where droughts exist
Yeahh the nerves are definitely kicking in
Real
Temu version
Randomly we wouldnâ€™t have water
Okay enough mathposting for today
It also had carcinogens beyond federal standard
And now they have to truck water in daily
:0 love that
Or maybe it has no definite position (or momentum) and has to be considered as a probability?
cmsd is abysmal
Well I feel like itâ€™s kinda like the federal deficit, whatever you do itâ€™ll still be there

What wyd if you walk into the dorm and unpacking your roommate pull out that UNIT
Tears of joy
But I assume that question is directed at freshmen
Dude Iâ€™m gonna be pulling out my Squidward tapestry

Most outta pocket thing I have is only a Southpark poster
Might bring this though

Democracy won
Ya

weirdest thing im bringing is my hatsune miku plush
So you have set the ground rule that everyone has to say Gn to squidward right????
i have an eren yeager flag
Oh for sure
I should just put it in the hallway then
Sharing is caring

u gotta get them as a set
My room is gonna be the game room, Iâ€™m bringing my ps5 and an NES that I got recently
Adam wth
Is that until all 30 of your classes begin????
everyone we should pool our money to buy a shlanket for adam
How about
My advisor actually made me drop one of them 😭

None of us are gonna stand a chance 😔
Irresistible, I know
Yes we have a whole week of peak freshman energy with no distractions from chaos
Yea I know â€¦ I will be on campus as a junior and will be surrounded by chaos until the rest of us get here
And we will all be excited to be there and trying to make friends
So we will be at 1000%

Fake news

What theyâ€™re actually hiding in â€œspaceâ€
There was a nursing upperclassmen so âœ¨networkingâœ¨ as they kept stressing during talks and free food
free food was amazing
Could have got sm more people if they advertised THAT
@jschlanket did not come despite my peer pressure 😟
😭  me and u both buddy
Not worth my time

Please trust me: it will do you well if you resist this as best you can for the first week or two
Simple have no social awareness = no fear!
i was expecting so much more people

Yeah Iâ€™m planning on just sucking it up for a while
No one will admire ur gamer zone then
gotta make the friends so u have people to see ur epic gaming skills
ALSO sm free swag

All of you freshmen are the voice of the oracle predicting the future: who is most likely to be a mod on the class of 2030 server
Speaking of introverts and gaming setups
2030??
offered a lot of it to my brother because it all had alumni on it
Ah I see what ur doing
Iâ€™ll just bully all of them
As you know my roommate took it
Think we got our 2 answers
Troll time
take it back
True
Might cause roommate conflict smh
roommate conflict is healthy
My DUMBASS paid for something they gave out for free
roommate conflict provides enrichment
Roommate will love the schlanket
You heard it here first folks
to an extent
Here at CWRU, we provide enriching student experiences!!!
~~fight night~~
this is coming from someone who roomed with his two best friends and had little conflict
cant wait for all the enrichment imma experience
my hoodie â˜¹ï¸
Public school is its own kind of enrichment
public school is enriching yes but also only if ur school does stuff
😮
Once saw a kid sitting by the wall in the cafeteria, figured out that she was charging her ankle monitor 💀
Enrichment!
one of my friends 9th grade year was rooming with a new 10th grader which was already really dumb
Yeah
Choir room \:-(
also saw the worlds saddest and most mediocre promposal in the lunchroom
I ate lunch with my bio teacher once a week because it was more relaxing than the insanity of a high school lunchroom
for me it was 9th graders being isolated then everyone else could live with each other
Ah weird
being an RA at a 9th grade dorm was certainly an experience
There was a fight once where a one girl grabbed the other by the hair and swung her to the ground as she was coming out of one of the history rooms, a video of it got into YouTube as a mortal kombat edit
There was also once a fight club in the bathrooms, I worked with one of the participants
They would make fight posters and everything
there was an english teacher at my school who would call herself gommy mommy
what??
yeah it was a whole thing
students started it and when she heard she just embraced it
Gotcha
yeah she was just weird
In 10th grade we got our physics teacher to put on cat ears

my physics teacher would just treat class time as group therapy, and by that i mean he'd tell us why his marriage was failing

mine says that as well but when i checked the aid they sent it was a lot less
so im confused
oh thank GOD

This number down here
Should be what ur actually paying
Does the payment plan matter?
if I were to choose 3m vs 1m?
The payment per timeline is different but I would be paying the same right in the end?

I wanna like
Save up $700 ish *that I can spend* so actually most likely around 1k so I have something to fall back on
And then sell my computer and buy a new one
Since mine is pretty dated now
imo upgrade peacemeal and sell to get the next component
where to you sell old parts? just like ebay? and how old is old enough that no one would bother to buy it?
Ebay is where a lot of selling happens, and there are generally a lot of people buying parts of all ages
you can also Craigslist or Facebook marketplace but ymmv
good to know
we'll see if i managed to keep the boxes when we moved 💀
Depends on how modern the motherboard is tho, if it only supports older cpus and ram then a replacement may become the best option

What is better: a regular pb and j or an uncrustables one?
regular pb and j next question
It highly depends on who made the regular one
Yeah Hayleyâ€™s would definitely be better
Mine????
Uncrustables are awesome frozen
TRUE
Especially the chocolate ones
ofc mine would be better
Tbh just drop the peanut butter, give me a jelly sandwich
:0 thats crazy
Theyâ€™d just drop off uncrustables and other snacks at the dorms (best move)
😟
Ikr 😪 only ingredient household kinda stuff
but peanut butter...
What did peanut butter do to you??
Peanut butter is good in moderation
ah plenty to make but nothing to eat
Womp womp
May i ask what an Uncrustable is
😟
nah give me a jar of that stuff and some chocolate chips and ill finish it in a day or 2

Iâ€™d think so??
Oh those little creatures
The *creatures*
c r e a t u r e s
Speaking of them like gremlins
peanut butter chocolate chip cookies
yes
Nutella is better than peanut butter
New combo unlocked?
True but I think they are two separate categories
but nutella and peanut butter sandwiches taste like reeses peanut buttercups
Nutella + banana slices 🧑â€🍳
Nutella has sugar and makes me feel Not So Good if I eat it too early in the morning \:-/ QED
Yeah thatâ€™d taste strange (Nutella and pb)
True mb what I am saying here 😪🤧
Gotta keep an open mind
Is this the self-awareness of wise decisions unlocked after freshman year?
Or sophomore year
ah
whats the breakfast outlook for junior year
lol thats gonna be me
Not looking good imma be real
I'm guessing breakfast is like the gym where a lot of people go at the beginning of the school year but then numbers thin out
I got brunch on the weekends as a freshman
brunch is a weird concept
because what differentiates it from lunch
Breakfast food
i think its just a time thing that differentiates it
true but it serves the same purpose as lunch
(Hes too invested in this)
also the whole concept of brunch is weird bc if it's ur first meal then it should be breakfast bc ur breaking ur fast
and if its ur second meal thats lunch
exactly hm
What if dinner is sometimes my first meal of the day
then ur just like me
and its breakfast
brinner
brunchinner
the ultimate meal
potentially
also I saw that classes are starting to randomly spawn on canva?
yeah worth a check
Three (3) of my classes have appeared, four if counting Glee Club
nice
all i got rn is anth
at least its something
which anth?
103
ah
im in 127 i think
love 9 am course signups yippie
i still only have one canvas course
with no syllabus
i can just stare at the people in my class 👁ï¸👁ï¸
me too 😭
fun fact the CHEM canvas courses always go up instantly bc itâ€™s a department person that puts them all up
once i had a semester where i was taking 6 classes and three were chem so half my classes were up when i registered
3 chem classes at once??
eughhhhh i like chem but 3 chem classes at once sounds like hell
orgo 2, orgo 2 lab, biochem
orgo 2 and biochem at the same time was not fun tho i must say
2 of mine are up, one of which im likely dropping 😔
i might drop mine
or p/np
if iâ€™m not getting an A iâ€™m gonna p/np
What's dropping
thatâ€™s withdrawing
seniors often p/np bc they take classes to get to the right number of credits
ah
theres cs classes i really wanna take just for fun but i also wanna graduate on time
its a fine line
the amount of classes that clash with each other makes me wanna scream
People with nut allergies are nerds
Iâ€™m allergic to hazelnuts
Every other nut is fine
Just hazelnuts
Interesting, usually itâ€™s peanuts I feel like
Getting called a nerd for an allergy 🥲
Thereâ€™s plenty of other reasons too
Youâ€™d better report me for bullying
I'm sure the moderators of this server will take such a report very gravely
/report @michael_cjr meanie
See here's the thing: I don't *think* I have any allergies, and don't know of any, but one of the ice cream flavors at Mitchell's makes the roof of my mouth tingle in a not very good way
Hahaha at least Iâ€™m not a cs majors 👉
🤨 I think that might be an allergy dude
Nah his mouth is just silly
Must have been fun to find out
Yes ofc but I have no idea what it could be
Official diagnosis right here
@reddishlightning this comment might invoke a response from the mods?
Iâ€™d trust any doctor who called my mouth silly
It is caramel ice cream and I have no idea what ingredient could possibly be in it, because it's only that flavor of ice cream and only at Mitchell's and caramel, ice, and cream on their own are no problem
So it might be an allergy, but I have no idea what
Interesting
mouth silly - dr. Adam, Ph.D. in ~~being a nerd~~ mathematics

I removed your '28 role for about 30 seconds so your name turned white and it would look like you had been banned
Oops
Well it changed for ME
I definitely changed I definitely saw it, maybe yall are colorblind or something 🙄
Rare nursing W
I knew a girl in high school whoâ€™s colorblind, apparently thatâ€™s super rare
My dad is
Great for practical jokes
Or just goofy moments
yeah bc the colorblind gene is on the x chromosome so females are commonly carries while males express the trait
Can I be a pedantic nerd for a second
Oh god
Okay this is something thats been crazy to me forever, supposedly like 1 in 10 or 1 in 12 men are colorblind, IVE NEVER MET A COLORBLIND PERSON HOW
we're already nerds all the time
Idkk man *can* you?
This is showing how dumb I am with this stuff- males are XY and females are XX, right?
Um ackshually, that specific kind of colorblindness is carried on the X chromosome but in general, colorblindness is found all over!!! 🤓 â˜ï¸
I think
Combo
But also you might just not know because it's not something so integral to life that they might feel the need to mention it
True
oh yeah ik im just using red green color blindness as a general example since its the most common
Often -- I know two people (mostly) identifying as male who are XXY and XYY respectively
The hs biology classic
What causes somebody to have an extra sex chromosome?
Just some random mutation?
Hey man i loved ap bio
So
Oh god this conversation just reminded me of a video presentation some people I knew made about Down syndrome in 8th grade, where they expressed hopes about a future "surgery to remove the extra chromosome" 😭
The secondhand embarrassment was very intense
We have 2 sets versions of each gene which are on these x shaped structures called chromosomes
A random of these is kept in sex cells (eggs and sperm) because of the way they divide
So usually each sex cell has half the genes (1 version of each specific one)
â€œyea im just gonna pull out this chromosome ahahaâ€
This just made me remember that some of my old slideshows from 8th grade are public to the world and i cant delete them because i deleted the email i made the account with
And if that egg or sperm is used in reproduction then you get an extra X or Y if the extra genes are on chromosome 21
(Iâ€™m a lil rusty lmk if I goofed on anything)
Interesting, it just steals one of the chromosomes from the other cell
Yes exactly
And some people have just an X!
Itâ€™s called non disjunction
Yeah bc you could have come from the sex cell that was stolen from
Itâ€™s interesting that only X is fine but only Y cannot survive
Well, X is like an order of magnitude larger than Y
Yes minor detail
Was there any reasoning behind switching the placement of CS and â€˜26 in your title
How long has it been? 9 days now i think? @reddishlightning
Wait
YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME OUT ON THIS!!!
Ofc you are in on this
It's been 10 days
Second nursing win of the evening?
Any reason?
i noticed but kinda shrugged it off
oh i thought yall were just being weird
Someone else here has done it as well
Alex, this is just copium
Freedom of expression amiright?
But good for y'all
I was just about to say that its been long enough so we should get michael in on it too but it was found

she works in âœ¨a public middle schoolâœ¨
I was tempted to change mine just for the hell of it
Wait actually
I have an idea for an update to my nickname, which will be much more normal and much more sinister at the same time
Curious to see what this will be
I see
thats def a name
Thats a name too
Come on Alex you are fooling nobody
Literaly no one believes you're graduating in 304888344611713860501504002000
But I even added 2000 to it so it's more realistic
why r we doing this

true
thatâ€™s what i majored in!
thatâ€™s a joke guys thatâ€™s a joke
I decided to triple major
Iâ€™m just gonna wait probably forever for Knot theory
It will be offered when you're a sophomore
YOOOOOO
i think my favorite thing in a world of people graduating early and graduating lateâ€¦ i am graduating chronically on time
Dr. Langer gave us all ropes during knot theory to tie knots with, and one of my friends managed to tie his own hands together during the lecture so tightly that he had to get it apart with his teeth for 10 minutes.
chronically on time
That sounds like a good class
he has been my pfp for the past 3 years or so
I'm already going for the Ph.D. so no point and also MS applicants are expected to have more research background so it would make life harder for me
yeah an MS is a waste of money if youâ€™re planning on phd
So itâ€™s best to just not do the bs/ms if I want to get a PhD?
Also @michael_cjr congrats on switching to math being your primary major, youâ€™re becoming one of us
it can make you a stronger applicant
However
a masters can help make up for that
thatâ€™s like. the only case i would think of for doing a masters if you 100% intend on a phd
Thatâ€™s pretty much whatâ€™s going to happen
Yes
but if you play them right and have good research experience it shouldnâ€™t be necessary
🤞 hopefully I can beg my way into some research relatively early
honestly iâ€™ve said this before
itâ€™s easy to get imposter syndrome when it comes to research at CWRU
Dude I already have crazy imposter syndrome in general 💀
itâ€™s all about perspective
Drop out of Case at this point probably
😭
play them right in terms of
having â€œsafetyâ€ schools (no school is safe when it comes to grad schools)
but not applying to only top ranked schools
SHHH, youâ€™re ruining my plan
I SAW THAT
Saw what?
So the strategy is to apply to a bunch of schools?
no
60 schools minimum
itâ€™s not practical to apply to more than 9-12 schools when youâ€™re going for phd
bc schools evaluate if youâ€™re a good fit
iâ€™m applying to 11 and thatâ€™s on the higher end
your recommenders will also get annoyed at you if you apply to a lot bc they have to submit the letter individually to each portal
itâ€™s not like college applications
I honestly donâ€™t know whereâ€™s even good for physics, other than like mit
youâ€™ve got a lot of time to think on it
and research
Yeah, I forget that this is a me in 2-3 years problem
you can base it off the list of R1 schools and start researching there. you can also pay attention to where your professors went bc a good chunk of faculty in a given field come from like 20% of institutions or something crazy like that
Iâ€™d bet that Harvard, Stanford and Berkeley (go California!) would be good bets aâ€™well
so iâ€™m just guessing if i could get into schools tbh!
I have two moods:
I will get into everywhere
I will get into nowhere
yeah
I think thereâ€™s a roughly 30% chance I get in absolutely nowhere
True
you probably have to take it
haha inferior field still makes you take the GRE haha
Cope
i love the lab idk what youâ€™re talking about
i live for the lab
I'm basically going to apply to like a list of 10 schools with good polymers programs
my physics teacher in hs took 7 years to get accepted to a masters program 😭
and soon, you'll get to live in the lab!
hey guys if i got 11th floor clarke am i screwed 😔
have a fan and earplugs
it gets hot up there sometimes and the wind is LOUD
the penthouse âœ¨âœ¨
ooo okay good to know! thx o7 dyk how hot it gets/if the heat is tolerable with a fan, especially closer to summer? i get heat-triggered migraines smtms so i wanna be prepared lol
hooray!! 😭
i mean that sounds like a valid case for an AC unit
â€¦ just saying
this
i don't think so but do it sooner than later because things can sometimes take a bit with disability services
also if you get the ac unit consider taking it out during the winter so you can open the window
i did not do this and was waking up from heat in december
lol remember when they had heat up until like almost summer break
ohhh i see 😭 yeah i think i'll do that then
Housing will either cook or freeze you during the winter (in the older buildings at least) there is no middle ground
It was 55 degrees for about a week in our common room this winter
For all I disliked my freshman dorm I have to say the heating was solid
REAL
honestly i'll take 55 degrees over this hell summer 😮â€💨
no good in the summer ofc but we dodged having an overheated room in winter
me and my roommate (as much as i love her) have very different ideas of a comfortable temperature and stj does in fact have working thermostats so thatâ€™ll be fun
my army of woozoo fans is always by my side
@hicinserenomen or @cygnusxxii
im pretty sure you do, yeah. @tazmania40 confirm?
If you're not gonna use it often, i'd say don't bring it unless there's other extenuating circumstances
im gonna need it for church and dentist appointments
do i need to worry about buying it now or can i take care of that during move ins/orientation week
depending on what church you're going to, you can likely carpool/bus together, which i'd strongly recommend, but yeah that makes sense
imo buy it now, ~~especially if you can get your parents to pay~~ as it's significantly easier. then you'll pick it up at move in
(i think they'll pay this year at least)
you can probably park for free if you're top of the hill southside, but I'd just take a look a couple times during the year
for next year
ah okay
I bought one for the two years I've lived on campus
and am not buying one cause my off-campus apartment includes parking
~~which I got them to include for free~~
they're pretty sketchy landlords imo
but they offer a cheap apartment and I can function for myself
yeah i would buy it now bc if you wait there may be a wait to get one
Which AIQS should I do
I mean if it is interesting to ya
Why not
Actuallt cemeteries looks cool too
Bicycles or cemeteries someone pick
Oh I disnt even read that
In the cwru portal thing
Dw Ik because I did the same thing
So you can also base the decisions off what fits better and balance it with what interests you
Right
Yeah I get that, I hope it works out
with the sages curriculum class = professor. so like the class was taught by the same professor every time with very little exception
This has carried over

glad i have somewhat valid advice
they changed so so much between my sophomore and junior years

Whatâ€™s the best sophomore year housing
tippit or staley probably
Stj or village
Do the lottery
Risk it for the biscuit
^
i got stj 😎
yeah
doubles :|

Is it actually worth buying anything from here
what is that lol
The bookstore
They keep emailing me
I made filter to automatically delete those lmao
Hell no
Ya Iâ€™m so excited mine looks fire
i should have gotten a single
why
😭
yes
ya
uhhh u can request a single room
if it bothers u like a week in
or rn
i mean between being in gih or having a single i ould like to see how gih is but im more concerned with how my roommate
💀
but yeah STJ is nice itâ€™s not doubles I donâ€™t think
Iâ€™m just gonna try my hardest to get a nice room as an upperclassmen
Are rhe strobe lights for ur alarm or for fire alarm
Fire I think hold on let me see
Ya usually u make friends and then decide to room with them soph yr
It's both
Like u can set an alarm?
with the lights

Like
Dude I want a strobe light alarm clock, itâ€™d force me to actually wake up lol
Not for my own alarms but for the fire alarm and for if anyone knocks on our door
For the fire but
Ya
free rave time
My thoughts exactly 💀
Yeah I was about to say the same thing
Interesting
RGB around the room
rainbow road final lap???
Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s button they press
Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s some way around it
*music gets faster*
I'll let it rock for now
real
talk to your contact at disability resources about the necessity of getting a single. They'll give you one if you ask
yeah... I doubt you'll get a GIH single with that though
there are generally singles available overall
also if you have questions about disability resources stuff wrt housing, I have a lot of info so feel free to DM me.
22 days till move in
Mfker
Huh
Might major in it too
ni
no
Lmfao
thereâ€™s an impostor among us

Daily? Why not hourly
maybe the good ol daily random poll
Why not every minute?
secondly
The daily poll channel on a server I'm in was voted by server members to be changed to be called ||r/hutchingscirclejerk||
Beautiful name
does this count as 4 votes in favor?
I think it does
If y'all want a polls channel I will make one but I am NOT calling it that

Bro why are you impersonating me

Shat house? How dare you call it that
yk ive learned that i have the ability to make those going to case question if the student are actually smart or not
why you change pfp
:(
look what youve done
D: THE SHAT HOUSE
actually no this is good i like fire
I like fire too but not on the schlouse
The Case Arson Club grows closer to existence every day
Iâ€™m in
Its a joke until i get a lighter
nono its the axe throwing club * wink wink * now
>:3
\> fire mentioned
\> Michael is immediately online
I wait for the mention of arson to show up
Such a great movie
frr
god i love spirited away
its just too good
we should have a ghibli movie marathon when we get to case yall
Iâ€™m down
even like billie eilish man
https://open.spotify.com/track/7BRD7x5pt8Lqa1eGYC4dzj?si=bb6c0eadf54f48e6

straight gas
also not on there
boy and the heron
NOOOOO
so we ~~kidnap~~ hutchings for the marathon
So we Hutchings for the marathon??? What does that sentence mean
make all of insert frat join
go straight to international hq
I mean we played the theme from Princess Mononoke in marching band one year
require all chapters hold a studio ghibli marathon
Insert frat does have a good movie room
I EVEN HAVE THIS GUY
I would be in there playing Jackbox with my friends during finals week ~~every night until 3 AM~~
yeah wait OX boy and heron showing when
dats what im sayin
also boy and the heron
so its winter break
im about to go see the movie
i check my email
case acceptance letter
:0 thats crazy
yeahhh
i got my case letter right before my winter concert for orchestra
no way???
yeah
hopefully that was a nice associtation and not just stressful
was not good that i also cried
smh imagine not having a fun memory
yeah alex get on our level smh
massive fumble on their part huh
such a big fumble that they had to revise their decision
okay i have question, how many girlfriend having people got ungirlfriended sometime between case acceptance and start of freshmen year
🖐ï¸
my ex too but she was not there in person
Real
dw its a wisconsin rural thing not u trust
she got into case too ea but did not go
Her loss
I got rejected by 22 colleges
😐
glad you got in here
again their loss
could have had foith???
Thanks lol
22 is wild I respect the grind
True Iâ€™m glad
I did get accepted by 5 so Iâ€™ll take it
Case was my first choice for a while so I kinda counted on getting in (not smart)
I mean it worked
but yea would not advise
If i got rejected from case life would potentially be very different
I feel like the only place id count on is UNM
I got my acceptance right before my winter concert as well lol
Siblings 👎
ikr, imagine youd not have deal with certain name stealing gremlins
almost went for nursing
but I hated the campus
Same I almost applied for madison but I hated the campus
the park nearby was nice tho
I like the campus, and Pittsburgh is a cool city, but I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be happy at a massive college
exactly
also general student body = too normal
General Student-Body 🫡
A deciding factor
So true
Happy im going to case, not sure if id be able to cofound an arson club anywhere else
Iâ€™m very thankful Iâ€™m going to Case
Incorrect. I love my siblings! Most of the time.
🤨
Do you? If you do why did you flee to ohio?
is that i almost chose ut austin
dont confuse exclusivity with being a good fit kids
Fr??????
I think I only liked their gym and austin city limits.....
I see
I am TOTALLY kidding
My apologies
Itâ€™s a super nice campus but itâ€™s literally its own city within State College
RACCOONS!!!
I needed to think of a witty response
😭
we have skunks instead

welcome to the midwest in t minus 22 days
Itâ€™s the better coast so youâ€™re fine
Culverâ€™s hits
True, east coast >>>> west coast @reddishlightning
I think adam agrees 100%
Culvers = chicken, right?
and something bout cheese curd?
Butter burgers, cheese curds, and frozen custard
what differentiates ice cream from frozen custard?
Ew you have to go out the suburbs for Culvers
and best donut place right
Eh thatâ€™s very subjective but imo yes
Iâ€™m excited to go to Cedar point eventually
Whyd you delete the question
Imo its lakewood but thats also cuz i live right next to it
Itâ€™s lowkey fire
Incorrect
Youâ€™re just salty

How about we settle, juniper >>> every other dorm community
Deal
Agree

did they really just @ everyone on handshake
💀💀
Like sure I'm gonna apply for a waffle House internship before I even step on campus
Yeah but no RAs no room checks + off of case housing
REAL
Means if you have a maintenance request it gets done faster than 1-2 business week
Plus itâ€™s cheaper than case housing
Esp if you get a roommate
not if youâ€™re on financial aid
misinformation
Well yeah i guess
On technicality Iâ€™m right thatâ€™s not misinformation
i thought we were friends

Just curious, does anybody else here know how to solve Rubix cubes?
I do
I learned when I was like 10 and now I have a drawer full of random puzzles
Trying to finally learn full oll + pll
Good luck thatâ€™s a lot of algs
I can solve odd by odds
I already know a good bit of both but I just need to finish it out
I want to get faster at 7x7, thatâ€™s probably my favorite
Itâ€™s summer break and a lot of profs donâ€™t check emails, you should probably wait a couple more days and then if they still donâ€™t reply to you, try sending a follow up email
Itâ€™s also possible if you sent it from not a case email that it just gets filtered out
Iâ€™m sure I sent it from a case email, but yeah Iâ€™ll wait a little bit and see what happens
Yeah, Iâ€™d give it a week
Dr Marten, for physics
I know he was out until the 22nd
I sent a first email on the 22nd and then a follow up on the 25th
that was two days ago he is probably not checking emails that frequently because its the summer
so I wouldn't worry at least for a little bit
Yeah definitely wait a week
👍
how much was that domain?
dang
very nice
I think that's the starting price for the com tld, there are even cheaper ones
mine was dirt cheap

That's strange, it could be an extension issue
may be my ad blocker/privacy tracker
I think so. I'm not seeing any errors in logs
they are pretty agressive about nuking cookies etc when they feel like it

what is an i clicker?
Whyâ€™s that?
jonesy from fortnite
something that exists solely to force you to go to class
Itâ€™s a device for polls
Going back to a conversation from like a month ago, I concede defeat, California really is the best state 😌
Why is that?
Iâ€™m in Monterey right now and itâ€™s just so lovely here
Cap
Like lowk yâ€™allâ€™s have everything here
Beaches, trees â€œmountainsâ€ (hills)
Oh we have real mountains too don't worry
But I saw otters!!! And went tidepooling
whatâ€™s tidepooling???!?
As a native born and raised Coloradan I cannot say that yâ€™allâ€™s have mountains
It's like the Tide Pod challenge but you dissolve them in water first
@jschlanket
Not in the part of California where you are maybe. But we have mountains high enough to hold snow in June
YO MY FAVORITE SNACK WAS MENTIONED
And even some glaciers, although those are quite remote
colorado has you beat on mountains
When the tide rises enough, it leaves some sea water in these like rock pools
And then when the tide goes down, it leaves some of the wildlife in those pools
by tens of feet lol
Cope

im not even from CO lol
Where are you from
Crab
Only one 😔
Jkjk
Of course y'all have more mountains, but one cannot claim that California does not *have* mountains
Cali: no mountains
CO: all the mountains
On the other hand, "top of the hill" on CWRU campus should not be called a hill. That is not a hill. It is like a small mound.
NC
- at least 2 non-Coloradians
we have the blue ridge mountains and houses that cost less than 1mil per 100 square feet 🤷
We have those too, California is more than the most populated areas
and no wildfires
and cheaper gas
I live on the edge between a relatively "normal" area as far as the US goes and quite rural and sparsely-populated areas
So up there, it's hella cheap!
You have to remember how flat the midwest is, for us its significant enough to be a hill
Thats what they all say until it hits you
we just have hurricanes instead
i'll take hurricanes over wildfires
personally, i would like to go back to india
would rather live in cleveland than most of california tbh
Only thing I heard about India weather is that Bangalore has awesome weather
No idea if that's true or not

yup tis wild

itll be fine
I definitely packed way ahead of time
I have most of my stuff I just need to get it together mostly
Yeah I'll prob do like 20 different target or Walmart runs during move in day
Bring them if you have space, it's easier for you than for me because I flew with stuff
this is the only book you need with you at all times smh
I remember reading that bad boy in 2018
its amazing
the detail is awesome

Would it be useful / would I have space to bring another shelf thing to hold books and other stuff for my dorm?
I did not have enough books with me for such a shelf to be useful
I mean Iâ€™ll just put stuff in the closet and use the shelf unit thatâ€™s already there
Thatâ€™s probably the smarter move

why does thwing blast music.
Why are you in Thwing
why not
staying near case and needed a new place to study for summer courses (Ive proceeded to spend a good chunk of that on here)
Yeah the Thwing music is questionable at times
its a general building not an ice rink or mall, why do you need to blast your tunes 🤨
(its actually a non issue)
Any for clark?

@michael_cjr your move

Who would ever get confused by this great integral
🙂
That was an easy problem
Whoa whoa whoa
\> v = 3
\> dv = 1
???
🤓🤓🤓
Its not illegal to do ibp like that its the same process you do for integrating ln(x)
How do you integrate ln x
To lazy to type it out but i do it the same way integral calculator does it
Wait but how does that relate to this
How does v=3 -> dv=1
For that problem f = 3, gâ€™ = 1, so fâ€™ = 1 and g = 3
Same thing where you just make up the 1 and integrate it
🤓
Iâ€™ll wear it proudly
i did it geometrically
Even better

we're so back
If only it ever worked in the first place
it did for me when it was around

What's the general concept?
You are given 4 numbers and you must make 24 using them
Ooh that sounds fun. 4 standard operations?
Yes
Here is the hardest one I know of
1 5 5 5
Are factorials allowed
No
And you must use all numbers once and only once
Correct
Pondering
You do not get to do that
Iâ€™m throwing it directly at you actually
Can I concatenate and/or exponentiate
I donâ€™t know if that would help but itâ€™d be funny
they used to make us play this in elementary school i always hated it 💀
i have a solution for exponentiation
||5*5-1^5||
Yeah I've done similar things

How is everyone?
Is this actually solvable or did you just throw this together at random
I'd like to thank wolfram mathematica and the OEIS
It is solveable
Well if y were x itâ€™d be pretty easy, just let u = arccosx

Hey
Also proud of myself for not having to google the LaTeX for this, actually learning

... estimating an integral is computation and finding a clever u-sub is good
Alright alright alright gamers who's ready for a devilish integral
This is *not possible* to do as an indefinite integral so get ready for ...

fine adam
guh i do not know any nice integration techniques beyond finding explicit antiderivatives
Good! This was problem A1 on the Putnam last year. You should take it this year
I would like to know that too
Answer to funny integral
oh beautiful
that's fantastic
Alright, if you want to try another problem in the same way, try deriving

dont have the brainpower to figure out where to parameterize rn but will take a look tmrw
you kinds and your symbolic solvers
rk4 supremacy
You could also ... just ... do the integral?
like in this case or more generally?
Integrals are fun but at some point itâ€™s less about doing the integral and more what the solution is / what the integral is doing
that's called being an engineer

Ok good
im gunna warn you ahead of time that there were pop quizzes when I was taking this course
other than that it should be ok
How many omg and do you remember when and the format and stuff??
There were only like 4? among the prelabs
they were like 1 easy question at the end of class
based on what the next lab is gunna be
Like if itâ€™s based on the nezt lab how do you know
Is it based on the lecture or whatever
then he might give a pop quiz on what he spoke about in that same lecture
As long as u pay attention or whatever
Nah just read through the procedure beforehand and u will be fine - the pop quizzes are mostly for attendanceâ€™s sake
Got it thank you
Hmu in like a year from now
â€¼ï¸â€¼ï¸â€¼ï¸
they hit everyone up
Should do it in a year
im losing my mind over how long its taking
good news 🙏  they got back to me on my appeal and i can afford to go here again
Period congrats
yeah i got mine too
which ones do you all have?
ive got modern virtues
I got fight the power
Just pay attention and u will be fine
out of curiosity how difficult are aiqs
And now Iâ€™m at 19 credits..

are there two different class â€˜28 roles
@jschlanket you have been discovered
NOOOOOOO
🤓
mine is lighter too
But also jeez that took a while, i thought it was more obvious
im special
â˜¹ï¸
It has been slowly lightening
I was thinking of slowly changing the '28 role to be red
But that would be too funny
no purple > red
Was a silly little thing
We were
I was thinking of making myself red because red is a good color
look at me iâ€™m so observant
😔 yes
What if we noticed but did not say
🧐
sheep
baaah
Baaaah
Great minds do think alike

we share the same braincell
No but I did bc I changed mine to normal
you gotta change the whole role
seeing them side by side is too obvious
I will freely admit I did not notice anything
i also have not really been around
This is what I was thinking as well but nOoOooOOo
iâ€™ve been successful on the tiktok front
Ooh good poll
What works for me is the app that blocks it
Ooh nice
For a certain period
And you can take breaks from the blockage but you pause before
i always just ignore my screen time limits itâ€™s an issue
Sociology + premed
thats so real
What gets me is genuinely YouTube shorts, Iâ€™ll just be watching videos and then realize that Iâ€™ve been scrolling through shorts for 20 minutes
me but instagram
iâ€™ve decided watching youtube videos instead is healthier bc at least iâ€™m not nuking my attention span
Iâ€™m basically not active on stuff except for instagram (where Iâ€™m pretty sure I follow a majority of the class of 2028)
Itâ€™s that going from the peace of not knowing to the addictiveness all at once?
i finally got tiktok because i couldnt open the vids my friends sent me constantly but i refuse to let myself on it for any other reason because ik ill be absolutely hooked 🫠
yeah 😔
my screentime is insane because i fall asleep listening to the same youtube playlist every night
Me in 2019
Thatâ€™s wild
so one of them has to go
I am now a hopeless brain rotten tiktok addict with a less than 10 seconds attention span

I'm torn between making a 55 year old conservative MAGA Facebook persona, and a 13 year old edgy teenager who just discovered atheism Instagram persona
They complain about us and tiktok when itâ€™s the same with them for Facebook
Sig psi?
Yep
What if the two were combined
😭
Iâ€™d go ultra-conservative 13 year old, really interesting group
Yes
itâ€™s not every day a greek org dies
😔
You should rush phi psi
iâ€™m a girl
We can use the extra head
do the 55 year old you can find a lot of interesting groups
Fill our housing req
This is why Iâ€™m saying a conservative 13 year old would be cool, they could even be an edgy atheist at the same time
Are you guys in case housing?
Yes but no

She works primarily through telegram, you can contact Hannah Joe Hartman at telegram . me / HannahJoeHartman223
Can you tell me what number that is?
I also make use of the services of Hannah Joe Hartman and have had great success. I am closing on my second house today!
do yall need brothers to stay in the house
iirc every greek org under case housing has a minimum occupancy requirement
someone i know got a couple hundred dollars from this
literally said it was a pump and dump shitcoin from the day he made it but people still bought in
Yessir
We love case housing
Such a cool organization
No issues whatsoever
Not a single one
my favorite thing about housing is how many offices it is

Tbh it's usually impossible to meet everyone in a chapter during a recruitment period of standard length
did it for you lol
see that makes sense but sigma psi was so small that i figured it would be reasonable
True tbh. Some people are just less social as well
Lmao
I would say as a rule of thumb you would expect to have met at least like 20-25% of a chapter before you're thinking of joining it
That's usually enough to get a solid vibe
i suppose that makes sense
you met like 8 of us at least i think

keep em guessing
Im a man of multiple truths

It is a great honor
many truths existing is a uwc classic
Thank you mr nerd
Oop Alex called me a nerd guess I should change my nickname to reflect this
Now Alex guess how many connections I have, and I'll tell you higher or lower
I mean i saw your profile
I think it said 425? So it should be 426
Yeah
😭
Connected with a lot of people
Someday I know I will look at your profile and we'll have like 45 mutual connections or something like that
I also found your github page
Hmmm, Now How Did You Find That?
Wait why do you have two linkedin profiles
linkedin pfp
When itâ€™s closer to move in time I will send a real one
Same goes for you
weâ€™ve never met
Well if we both happen to be in Cleveland at the same time that can be arranged
iâ€™m always in cleveland
theres no way i gotta pay like 40 dollars for a clicker right 😭
okok thats what i thought
I would set a profile picture for linkedin but then adam will see it, so Iâ€™ll have to wait
So thatâ€™s how he did it
I already know what you look like

🤓
Sounds like a trap to make me set one so you do know
(I do not know what Alex looks like)
For $3 I'll Judas Adam in a crowd

The third segment of your nickname is inaccurate

are you by any chance related to yk the guys responsible for the financial collapse
Which one
2008
That crash was caused by banks for the most part, no?
No
Congress passing bills for â€œaffordable housingâ€ did
If you say so
Lehmann Brothers
I'm not related no
Please find information from places other than conservative thinktanks before you say stuff like this lmao
Hey congress passing affordable housing bill opened up the window for garbage loans 🤷🏻â€â™‚ï¸
Tisn't worth the fight, though I applaud the effort
Like I agree itâ€™s a lack of regulation but whose fault is it for the lack of regulation 💀
Goldman sachs emailing
😭😭
Hope this helps. Any other grand inquiries?
Alright yâ€™all Iâ€™d like to not start a political discussion in the server tyvm
Letâ€™s end this please 👍
I got one for like 5 bucks on eBay
It's a solid job honestly
where in the housing portal do you sign up for a move in time
My assignments, then go to Fall 2024
tysm
No problem
Is it just because there are so many more negative smells
but it is quite neurosciency bc the olfactory system is very much neuroscience
true
i would have to read a paper on it to get you an answer
i know about Epilepsy. thatâ€™s like it
Itâ€™s getting real

tbh move in day is one of the most fun days in college
enjoy it
*hype intensifies*
Fr?
itâ€™s not like the only one
but itâ€™s definitely an experience and thereâ€™s nothing quite like it
Epic 👍👍
Move In day is set :scaredassblockofcheese:
Itll be a long and tiring pilgrimage to get there early but i think its doable
At least you'll hopefully get there before your roommate

ayy
Thats what it is
Ohhhhhh okay
Brilliant idea
Not heavy enough
I could push a bed frame over easily
Perfect
early drop of is just to get your stuff in the hallway iirc?
oh itâ€™s room that makes way more sense
i saw pictures last year of stuff in hallways so assumed based on that 💀
Alex this means I will not be moving your stuff in
No frat boys with carts and elevators
Greek move in is kind of fun but it's also frustrating to deal with angry and overbearing parents lol
What did you get Charlie
Yk like parents that are extremely particular about what has to go where or get pissy about us having to take multiple trips/wait for the elevator
Or you were hella unlucky
Little bit of column a little bit of column b
True
Have I made myself a hunting target by being here
I'm so ready to get jumpscared
Lmao, I'm excited for the freshman to experience life at CWRU
True! When was the first time we met? Calc 3 or glee club or kind of both
I think our first conversation was at a glee club smore night in the first week of class
Good times
I think sort of both
I think I met Bill when I came across him playing a giant chess match in thwing and I was like "your energy is so unhinged right now, I'm a big fan"
I saw you in Calc 3 and somehow thought in my head â€œsomeday I will be friends with this personâ€. Not â€œheâ€™s niceâ€, not â€œis that Charlie!â€ just â€œI feel that one day I will be friends with himâ€
Lmao
Sometimes gut feelings are accurate
Alright good night Charlie
Talk to y'all tomorrow
Emptying out your chamber pot out the window is a first impression for sure
glub smore night??
BILL
I mean depending on when if u send a text we can def show up and help u move things
I met Charlie after hearing about him from Sophie for like 4 months
love him
Same with Adam (Hutchings) actually
you hated him when i started dating him
yeah then I actually got to know him lol
Two Adams guh
Adam Hutchings gang
Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s a good dude
Awh :(
but heâ€™s my lovely amazing bf
he licks high voltage in texas now
Yummy power lines
yeah elon's power lines are especially tasty from what I've heard
Guys where do I sign up for the time slot for move in??
Itâ€™s in My Assignments and then you go select your Fall 2024 dorm and then you scroll down
There should be a link for signups
Iâ€™ll just ask my advisor
Yeah


A couple good comments
So real though 😭
numbers? whats that?
😭😭😭😭 what did u hear about me? I heard about you from Eric (and others) for at least a month before we met
for all you freshmen who think i need more nicknames i think a new one just dropped
Holy moly thatâ€™s amazing
Thatâ€™s a pretty good one but i think Iâ€™ll stick to soap for now
Honestly it was just like â€œoh I was with Charlie and â€¦â€ and my general understanding was that you were cool and I wanted to meet you. I donâ€™t remember any specific details. @cygnusxxii might remember more
i wasnt like sharing elaborate tales tho for sure. im just a yapper and i had a lot of fun at glub so im sure i talked about it + people there
when i first met charlie we had like an hour and a half long conversation
it was lowkey like the most naturally i have ever made a friend before
im guessing the most common nickname for you is soph
^ this. I didnâ€™t know much beyond the general vibes (good. Cool)
Is sis down
:newitemacquired:
they might be doing maintenance bc itâ€™s the summer during the weekend
Aww thanks
:)
do the big brita filters fit in the mini fridge?
theyâ€™re new so

Do my eyes deceive me or is that a new Hannah pfp?
it is a new one
Very cool

Me when I have to move them up a floor over a 4 day period
Are you allowed to ask your counselor the average grade ppl get for a class
I mean you could ask but I doubt youâ€™ll get an answer
And I got very mixed reviews
Which prof
Some ppl say Iâ€™m guaranteed a B and some ppl say sheâ€™s lenient so likeeee what do I do
Redekop
Stephanie Redekop
Reddit is not a good place to ask people about profs tbh
Valid
The â€œguaranteed bâ€ thing sounds like people who didnâ€™t listen to the feedback on essays tbh. No class is a guaranteed b, and the comment saying sheâ€™s lenient is probably more accurate. Most of the English and Writing dept is really good, so Iâ€™d give her the benefit of the doubt
Thanks 🙏🏽 plus I can see how it goes during the drop/add period rightâ€¦
Yes absolutely. AIQS classes are tougher to change than other classes, and dropping them is not really an option, but talk with ur counselor for sure
I will THANK
S
you could probably ask the prof
not that weird
like will case reimburse me if I overpay?
the feature lets us pick our own plan but im pretty sure I am paying no where near as much as listed in sis
They will reimburse if you overpay. You can also just wait, the deadline isnâ€™t for a few weeks iirc
Show up, try your hardest, and ask for help when you need it. I promise you'll be okay :)
Well school does come along just to end it
104 days is the dream
darn at the beginning I did say I was gonna re watch all the episodes of p&f
hows the how its made going alex
always next summer (itll hopefully be even more busy lmao)
Thank youuu
ive heard that its lowk a scam
it is

Completely hypothetically, in an imaginary world, would anybody happen to have pdfs of the textbooks for chem 105 and econ 102?
itâ€™s not used at all
Oh ok cool
Hypothetically, would you be okay with being dmed?
If this were even close to being a real situation, yeah sure
Well that is quite a whimsical scenario
Lmao
im devastated
🤓
Oh boy sure

Ok uh give me a minute
||27(x+y^2)(x+y^2+4)||
its double
||
||p||
What are x and y
That is a great question
I had to crash course iterated integrals for this
Iâ€™m pretty sure x and y are just independent variables, I donâ€™t see how they could have definite values
The answer is a number
But this is like having the answer to integral from 0 to 4 of f(x) dx have x in it
Oh itâ€™s the order
When doing multiple integrals you just do one integral at a time so for this problem youâ€™re integrating with respect to z first so you integrate z terms like normal and the x and y terms like constants and then evaluate the bounds, and then do the same for the next to integrals and the term your integrating with respect to
I could explain better if it wasnt over text
Yeah half the trick is figuring out which order to do them in
Like E&M and Calc III could so easily be one (1) course
Masochist
lol no
that would be a disaster
One semester feels like barely enough time to cover calc 3 or basic e&m, forget combining them
after a semester class in something you usually know maybe 5% of the subject, at most
so you'd go from knowing multi okayish and e&m okayish to even less

I was being a goof, but I understand the process
Just means itll be easier when you learn it in class
Thats pretty much it, just a note that if you hated optimization and related rates in calc 1, just wait for what youll have to do now
Oh true true
And also stokes and divergence theorems but not painful at all
Nah optimizationâ€™s fun
That is Stokes' Theorem
Iâ€™m just excited to actually learn calc in a classroom, never done that
Tbf, i didnt actually read the whole message well i just read the topics
I see
How was it before
Do you know it anyway though, or not
Ooooh nice
Awww I love curly bois 😔
To be fair it was over the course of like two years
Have you ever caught yourself reading Wikipedia at 3 AM?
no
... okay that's just me then
I also skipped precalc so that was a fun time
Yo samesies!!! (sort of)
Probably not shocking I know
But the stuff you don't care about BEFORE reading it is where all the rabbit holes come from
wait am i supposed to know what a jacobian is
itâ€™s like how much a region stretches under a change of coordinates (I think)
I know I learned the Jacobean but I already forget what it is
I mean itâ€™s something that should just be taught along with multiple integrals, you just might not know what it is by that name
i love wikipedia rabbit holes
I like reading about random people and then going into the events that they were a part of
Determinant of the derivatives of the change of basis matrix so it scales to whatever ur doing right
It is a matrix of numbers for a function which takes n numbers and returns m numbers: m-th row and n-th column entry is the partial derivative of the m-th component of your function with respect to the n-th input variable

Yo LaTeX works first try? I'm goated with the sauce
Maybe not 3am, but reading wikipedia articles is fun. I used to get more sucked into tvtropes tho
entering youtube rabbit holes >
I'm not a big fan of video form content
I enjoy reading
me too lol
real and true
But you *could* eventually make 15?!??!?
campus min is 12.12

that sounds extremely relaxing
they made minecraft irl 🤯

Wait fr
oh word
is anyone on campus already from '28?
oh awesome
you ready for the year ahead?
Not awesome I just watched twisters
LOL
YES (hopefully)

yes that sounds like it may be hard
oh well
I believe in ya, specially if you got a 5 in lang
thank youu
the storm is definitely storming here
try not to get sucked into the 'nado if one comes around
let me know in a couple hours if youre still standing 😭
And the phone alert finally came, take shelter until 5 pm and look out for flying debris, fun
yuh
i went to columbus just in time 💀

Yeah it is fine
Could be regional

Gotta pick your battles ig?
Tornados or floods
Lovely
Sometimes a sprinkle of wild fire too
california moment
Or river fire
Cleveland moment
cuyahoga moment
Excuse you
California (northern California at least) is perfect in every way shape and form
Whatâ€™s 310 and who teaches it
Hmm no not at all but thanks for the info
@michael_cjr do you have In-n-Out where you are?
So I think your point has been refuted
Iâ€™ve heard very mixed things about in n out
I'll say it in my native tongue (Californian)
The fries are like, *hella* mid but the burgers and the shakes are actually lit for real
We have Sheetz (the best)
Iâ€™m actually addicted to Sheetz
How would you put that in south-central-Pennsylvanian
I like ta go down to Sheetz every once in a while (after checking my crops, of course)
Those rich, liberal Californians donâ€™t know what a good gas station is
Yeah man, because we all drive, like, electric vehicles, and it's so it dude
Oh and people say â€œcreekâ€ like â€œcrickâ€
Alex have you had the honor of attending an In-n-Out before
See that brings me deep joy
Donâ€™t you dare besmirch the good name of Taco Bell
Flagstaff, arizona
Taco Bell calling itself "Mexican food" is an insult to the Mexican cuisine we feast upon out here
Taco bell is good, but it is **not** mexican food
should be its own category
"Taco Bell describes its menu as offering "Mexican-inspired foods", including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and nachos. However, some say that Taco Bell's food is not Mexican, and that Tex-Mex cuisine, like Taco Bell's, differs from authentic Mexican food in ways like ingredients and preparation. "
All of you will probably end up eating in Tomlinson eventually, and mark my words: *the Mexican "food" there is **not** Mexican food*
I will also openly say as someone born outside the range of influence of both in n out and whataburger, in n out is better
Yes, such as not being Mexican food
It's like Panda Express and Chinese food
good analogy
Real Mexican cuisine enjoyers eat that with the shell
There is a really awesome *actual* Mexican place like two minutes from my house, I love it
could ask my mexican roomate from last year lol
We have a really big Hispanic population here, so Iâ€™ve had some good food in my time
Dude the storm is getting real here
as someone who lived in cali for 4 years i agree
lol i feel like the burgers got smaller
still love the fries (with some seasoning and ketchup)
You're not in Cleveland are you?
im too spoiled
Itâ€™s fine
Itâ€™s like the month of January always
They salt it
Nah they expect us to bring our own shovels
I'll order a snowblower then
Iâ€™m bringing a flamethrower
(For legal reasons thatâ€™s a joke)
i need an engineering friend to make me things
exactly
are we allowed to just make about anything in the thinkbox
i believe so
Ask Daniel
looks like you could just build one
"legally"
Im excited to fuck around in think box and pretend I know how to make anything
I met someone who got in trouble for knock off cwru merch so maybe not that
Indeed
So can we make flamethrowers 🙂
What happens if we â€œaccidentallyâ€ make a deadly weapon
I mean if itâ€™s an accident then who cares right
You cannot make any weapons or parts of weapons in thinkbox
Otherwise go crazy
Define weapon
what about a non functional model of a weapon
What about Nerf gu-*blasters*
and we do the rest outside of the thinkbox
as in like convert
trinkets
â€œNo making weaponsâ€
â€œWell what about â€¦â€
I'm not sure the exact policy, but nerf blasters are not allowed, neither are mods for blasters
id just make small trinkets
Presents are cool to make, art, trinkets, really cool place
Rule 1: no weapons of mass destruction
That allows for weapons of minimal destruction
for making legal things is there like paperwork or anything or can we just throw on welding gear and go full bob the builder off the bat
I think they give you training and then youâ€™re free
Can i become michael reeves
Damnit I was about to call the surgery bot
Iâ€™d just make the projects way more shotty
And it was EMAE 160 that teaches you that stuff right
Make a robot that can go down to the local taco bell and bring back your food
not worth doing that for taco bell
Iâ€™ll make my own delivery robot
taco dash
if it was insomnia
Yeah, but that's not the only way to get it. EMAE 160 gets you mill and lathe certification in addition to learning other stuff. You can get those trainings separately though
Daniel is this conversation better than looking at fields* of corn or whatever
Yes it absolutely is worth it for Taco Bell
Yeah lol
Fields of corn are extremely entertaining
mid
great conversationalists
as someone who has built a surgical robot yeah honestly the video is pretty accurate
wow how did that go for you?
https://tenor.com/view/scary-meme-dank-emoji-creepy-gif-17128309
did you follow the same design with a sliding thingy
And a steak knife
We have made it to Columbus
Oof sounds like you're in Ohio
Correct
my slot is TuThur 8:30-9:45
For my metal health Iâ€™m saying itâ€™s not
🪙
we may see eachother
Let me see
are you also doin phys 123
or nah
😔
well like I did it as a job
1:00 - 2:15 Tu Th
yup we got the same slot
dope
columbus is epic :))
Hopefully I can have it locked in by the end of the week
do you have an idea of what slot you may get or is it just whatever opens up
ah I see
oh i thought there were two
whoops
There might be
Iâ€™m not sure
oh actually it may be the lab part that may be different
iircc
do they offer phys 124 in the fall?
id assume no
Phys 123-124 are only fall and spring respectively
Hurting my feelings 🥺
not this sem
Maybe you can sell your spot to Michael for $0.23
Iâ€™ll buy it for anything at this point
skip it meaning what
They donâ€™t give transfer credit for e&m, you have to take it at case
lol I just got an email saying consider taking it, I never actually enrolled
I would give my spot to michael for free if I had one
do they actually not? thats weird
At least for AP physics
I thought they have one to anybody who scores 4 or above in AP 1 and AP 2
Maybe? But that would only count for intro physics, algebra - based
they definitely give them out for ap mech, since thats the reason i got it
real
I definitely donâ€™t know all of the material but Iâ€™ll at least know whats going on
Well there are higher-level classes, classical mechanics and intermediate e&m
Depends on what you mean
If you want to take upper div physics classes then yes!!!!!!!
What would that be?
💀
do 123
sheâ€™s super fun. never had her for a class but she runs the writing center and iâ€™ve seen her around a couple times. very energetic very cheerful very enthusiastic
that is actually incredibly good to hear thank you
why? lol genuinely just curious
if you took ap physics c e&m you will be chill
Anyone doing the happiness AIQS?
this is definitely spam right
wonder how they're using a case account for it though
Yeah. Report it to IT
def
No, That Seems Fine! I Can Tell It's Totally Legit Because I Got An Email From The Same Person!
"Copy and paste this link to accept the job offer" how about no
Wait I thought I was buying property overseas
It was an investment
https://physiology.case.edu/people/students/masters-medical-physiology/brandon-michael-schmid/
Yooooo i got the same offer too
sounds good, thank you!
omg amazing offer
almost as if it's too good to be true
It was such a good offer I forwarded the email to UTech to see if any of them would be interested
@mudrocker do this by forwarding the email to help@case.edu
Off topic, I donâ€™t think you all understand how excited I am to get to school
12 days!!!
REAL. Me too man
Speaking of ...
🤓
Maybe you'll get to school and Jake and I will be the frat bros carrying your 12 plastic tubs of useless stuff up the stairs
Maybe your gf can transfer to CWRU
Alternately, you can move CWRU and all the people in it to wherever she is
Thatâ€™d be so swag
Iâ€™ll offer helpful moral support like â€œPUT YOUR LEGS INTO IT ADAMâ€
Well if youâ€™re at Taplin first thing, Iâ€™ll be there
Iâ€™m hoping I get morning
SAME
Hopefully CWRU helps you with that
Hey I am NOT breaking up with my girlfriend I love her so much
Iâ€™ll need to know so i know when to come jumpscare you

But ideally Adam and I are in a group of dedicated miscreants with blinged out tshirts helping yâ€™all move in
Wait Jake are you going to be there for move in
Yes
I thought you weren't but maybe I'm cooked
LET'S **GO**
There had better be a class on it
Also for some reason I like the idea of Ohio being a set
I can give you a sleeping bag on the floor of the Eigenspace
Temptingâ€¦ the hotel room might be a better pick tho
Eigenspace > hotel room
That's what I'm doing Spring 2025 (pray for me)
Let me know how that goes and if i should do the same
Iâ€™ll take grad complex at some point I hope
TAKE IT IN THE SPRING WITH ME AND NICO
Yeah idk if I want to wait that long until I can take complex, as itâ€™s super important for physics
Hopefully Iâ€™ll have all of my math requirements done in 2 years
Very very doable:
Fall 24: Calc III
Spring 25: Diff Eq, Linear Algebra
Fall 25: Abstract Algebra, Real I
Spring 26: Complex Analysis, Real II
Yep thatâ€™s the plan
He can choose abstract or scicomp
You should continue on after 308 and do 401 and 402 for even more fun
Ehhhhhhh
If I have an abundance of time and no social life remaining, maybe
okay, will do 👍
We can do it togetherrrr
Senior year \:-)
I do have like 0 classes to take senior year, so possible
They look so cool tho
Watch, my senior year is just gonna be every numerical class I can shove in

"0 classes"
Zero *required* classes
Ah
i take it in the spring so we'll see
@mounjee can we get a review on 250 (is that the right course code?)
yeah 250. erics been very encouraging about it tbh

yall can protest or wtv just ask us first
You are free to expess yourselves, but we must approve your expression

it is also up for review this november
Yes!!! I read about it
:ewww:
10 days??!!?
that's kinda crazy
I have 2 friends alr moved in bc of special circumstances
so kinda fibbing (I was on campus last night)
ikr its almost the single digit countdown
Hype goes crazy

I assume he means when we get on campus
Is it like some super huge auditorium orr
If I remember correctly, itâ€™s a mix of small group sessions with your orientation group and larger presentations with all first year students or by residential community
The latter are in large auditoriums
thats how it was for me yeah
omg hi fish
did they finally hack and down the cwru servers
I too am on campus hehehe

Thiccccccccc
Did your high school not have a graduation
A  D o  N o t  I n t e r a c t
mind cannot comprehend
yes but we had under 100 students
I only had 120
Imagine going to a big hs
and most were international so not everyones family could fly in
Mine had around 350ish students
I had 45
OK, buttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
imagine not getting to see the best speech of all time
What best speech did you see
Around here thatâ€™s MASSIVE
... Alex did you give a speech
Dude that's like twice the size of my school
^
I was only 7th 😭 fr I got cheated
7th in what
Ah
^
Yall had class rankings?
Thank u for ur service 🫡
again best speech ever
Im happy mine ranked because i made graduation ~5 minutes shorter
My schoolâ€™s speeches were just self-serving ego trips
My principle made a reference to a speech from last year but that's about all I remember
My school had one from our French teacher, and she did amazing
Cus the year before a kid said "no one's gonna remember this and we're all irrelevant" in his speech and during my graduation he referenced it by saying "no one's gonna remember me"
My whole district only has like 1,200 students
I attended my brother's graduation and they would NOT stop talking
Again yalls schools are tiny
We have one school of each level, with maybe 300-450 kids at each
Oh wow
Life in Tinyton, PA
Teeny tiny school district be like
There are 6 school districts in my county, for absolutely no reason
The valedictorians in my high school would take, no joke, about 20 APs
Iâ€™m pretty sure I was the most AP exams (maybe ever)
How many
Same some people really do be crazy
Nice
L imagine doing ib
*That* good?
Only a few schools around here do IB, mostly the larger ones in Harrisburg
You mean Penn State?
I did dual enrollment on top of ib because i was insane, but also the hs classes were what stressed me out my dual enrollment classes if anything made me feel sane
multiple valedictorians is crazy
... I feel like in a year when you're the owner of the Class of 2029 server, you're going to be like "how's this schedule everyone?" and it will be 8 classes + research + TAing and you'll call it a light semester
Oh no, I mean from different years
ahhh
iâ€™ve just heard of peopleâ€™s schools having multiple vals and i think thatâ€™s insane
Shhhhhhhhhhh that sounds pretty light
My school, after they dropped rank officially, just took the top ten and said they were great or smth
at my high school everyone is required to take 4 semesters of PE
Also woah you think im gonna be the owner of that server? An honor
i was actually a varsity athlete for 3 years (somehow)
Lucky for having weighted gpas, I've put my unweighted into weighted places because I have no weighted
i think that should be in my two truths and a lie
... who else would be
You..? Youre not gonna dissapear until the year after
regardless there were times when i was needed bc at most we had 14 athletes and 10 are needed for a full ladder
so if 4 people are not there i was guaranteed to play
I will not be the owner as a senior lmao
Interesting okay
with older people helping out as mods
Actually yeah i wonder if there are other 2028 servers that other people who arent here have made
Probably
Itâ€™s an offshoot of the big instagram group chat
How big is that gc?
It maxed out in size, so maybe 300?
Jeez
do yâ€™all not have patio
patio was all the rage when i was an incoming freshman
oh lol it shut down
O week seems pretty chill, I was expecting there to be way more
There will be more but you have to do it yourself (called â€œtalking to peopleâ€ or something)
Eww
You should also explore campus
I am bringing switch and 3ds, soooooo
Where is your dorm?
4th floor Taplin
Cool! I'm 4th floor cutler
Two best dorms back in my time
Best floor (Iâ€™m there)
Nah my floor is the best
Taplin is great (though the 3rd floor is the best in my completely objective opinion)
Says who
Says me, the authority on the matter
Woot woot
Does anyone know if waldorf towers bedroom can fit a queen mattress?
I DOUBT it
I think all the dorm beds are twin (xl)  but I cannot confirm
twin xl
4th floor taft better
This is all fake news, the people who know the truth know that Iâ€™m right
i only speak the truth
Guys guys guys stop fighting and come together for the important battle juniper is the best residential community
facts
juniper on top fr
I mean true
tbh
Thanks for letting me know.
Silly me bought a queen bed for the apartment
GIH moment
You bought a whole bed?
😟
I should've waited till the 12th when I move in to actually get the dimensions of the room but it's ight. Love gambling the space
wait so twin xl is just for the dorm beds iâ€™ve never heard of waldorf towers
maybe queen fits there?
I think so, I just did a rough estimate from the sqft of the entire apartment.
Is getting free ebooks common?

it happens your freshman year
we got physical books smh
right on
I think they gave us books in o-week
also are we going to know what group we're assigned to day 1?
A little drawstring bag will suffice. I think they might provide one actually
They can. Had a friend who lived in a  Waldorf 2 bedroom and he had a queen bed in each room
yeah its gonna be on the back of ur nametag
ur gonna meet ur group day 1 too iirc
Thank you very much
Right on
I am so hyped
Until you meet your roommate in person and hopefully not question your life choices
Nah my roommate should be cool (shoutout David)
Biochemistry 28 person?
Or not in this server
Yeah, he used to be pretty active but not for a while
I owe him ice cream

Oh nice. I have that channel muted but congrats on getting there
It was a while ago
is laundry included in dorm costs?
Laundry is free in the dorms yeah
Baer
does a prop lightsaber count as "making a weapon" in the thinkbox?
@dborhegyi
That's fine. I've seen people do it
At some point Daniel is going to send a 250-page rules.pdf which is just "You cannot make a gun. You cannot make a nerf gun. You cannot make a nerf blaster. You cannot make an angle grinder. You cannot make a sword. You cannot make a pretend sword which is still sharp for some ungodly reason. You ..."
In 10 days you will wake up in a dorm room
Yeah and I psyched
You will be a college kid
Fun read?
you get to drop any class at any time of the semester with no consequence to your transcript
spring sem too?
yeah
that's a crazy saftey net
It's for all the students who try and take 19 credits their first semester and realize their mistakes
T - 7 days
Eww
dang howd you get such a good deal
eBay
Like it had a few scratches on top
But absolutely NOTHING that should've dropped it's price by over $1000
Even the other eBay versions of it are around like $400 to $500
Youâ€™re gonna turn it on and itâ€™s gonna explode
the ones you see that are 1k have a better processor
No it's the same one
Example: this one for 2k on Amazon
Both have the 1165G7
Then there's the ones that have more ram and a GPU and are obviously more expensive
Is Pierce carpeted
zamn nvm then
2k is an absurd scam I have no idea where Amazon pulled that number from
enterprise prices go crazy
Mine is old and like breaking down
It still works but overheating issues so I might sell it for parts or something and then buy a new one once I've amassed somewhere around $1500
new laptop or new desktop?
Desktop
I know enough to not get myself scammed through exorbitant builder prices and charging an extra $100 for windows when nobody buys that legit
But if it's within like $100-200 of building it myself I'd probably tank that cost
https://toprigz.com/


Also this website that automatically finds PCs when you give a certain budget which I might use but Lord knows how long it would actually stay up
My current motherboard is like
A micro ATX board with parts and a case that are too big for it
It was a good deal when I got it but that was 3 years ago and it's starting to show it's age
yeah
I think mines micro atx as well
5600xt and a ryzen 5 3600
Definitely towards mid range

Yâ€™allâ€™s new dorm

WOAH i didnt know they were putting a plaza in between the buildings
that's very pretty 🥹 good place to talk walks
wow
Huh, nice! So the solution to it still being under construction is just fuck it and let people move in anyway?
yep thats what they told us in an email
Interesting lol, are any utilities missing or is it good enough at this point?
what they said
How do you check which AIQS you got?
If itâ€™s a fall one, look in SIS
which dorm is this??
This looks a lot more aesthetically pleasing than cutler
:Smile:
Ooh nice
new sophomore dorms
tysm
it better be aesthetically pleasing with how much they are charging us (grumble grumble)
I saw the common room for cutler
😭
Every common room for the freshman dorms looks like that lmao
chairs are great to nap in though
that's the important part
And Clemsons was a lot more modern
yeah the freshman dorms are decently old but they have charm
The dorms are very barebones. Itâ€™s a place to live, and it has what you need, but itâ€™s not the best place in the worldâ€”or even on campusâ€”to hang out
They actually redid it recently, it was shabbier looking when I lived there
The freshman dorms have character 😭
The way it was set up the first floor was a common area and like the 2nd floor and up were the dorms
And there was literally a TV the size of the wall there with a bunch of couches around it
We spent a lot of time hooking up various consoles and stuff to that tv
💀
Oh thatâ€™s awesome
Some guys set up a d&d map and had it displayed on it
I spent more time down there than I did in my dorm
In general for case:
1st floor: small tv, couches/tables/chairs, a piano, some chairs, a bathroom and a few rooms. 2nd and up are rooms, bathrooms, and a small common area with a couch and chair. Maybe a table
Found this part from a yt video
There was a TV covering the middle instead
storrs also
quad style dorms (from what ive seen) have 2 small common areas per floor: one with 2 tables with four chairs each, and one with a couple couches
juniper (and maybe other racetrack style dorms) has bigger first floor common rooms to make up for fewer on higher floors
At least I remember my friend had one in taplin
They do (or at least taplin does)
smith does too i believe
are the new sophomore dorms the only ones wirh practice rooms?
no
most dorms have them
Raymond did
sherman did
oh ok wild
lol what
yea it did
where???
they were in the basement by the elevator
WHAT
does cutler have any 💀
I just got an email from my RA, shitâ€™s getting real
I WAS WAITING UNTIL MIDNIGHT TO WAIT FOR WADE TO OPEN UP AND PRACTICE AND I COULD HAVE JUST GONE DOWNSTAIRS
looking at websites case did not look like it had many practice rooms 💀
6 in wade 4 in haydn
haydn has grand pianos that are better tuned but much less sound isolation
What kinda tightass RA sends emails, before move in no less💀💀
Itâ€™s an invite for the GroupMe
Is it joever chat
Ohh ok
Her name is Lear
that's more than EE
shhhhh
and less than that i think
ik there were less than 20 of us incoming my year and we were one of the largest freshmen classes
COVER LETTER?

Lear is a man
heâ€™s great
genuinely so nice
no ur fine
lear is awesome tho
Thatâ€™s good to know
heâ€™s not on my team and i know who he is so
thatâ€™s how u know
Mine sent one too
Mary-candler
Wait is there one RA for boys and one for girls?
no
one RA per floor
Oh ok
some floors are coed
Idr if GIH is the entire floor
Or just a section of it
Recipient list for mine is hidden
I can double attest, you lucked out
😞
ig we gotta have patience or smthng
A lot of the racetrack floorplan dorms do single gender floors
how do you know lear
Lear called me the C word and kicked me once
i mean regardless the person is the RA for GIH, and if theyâ€™re on cutler 4 they know they have GIH
regardless they are the RA for the whole floor
I think he saw us playing pool at like 10 pm in taplin and was intrigued as to what the heck we were doing already there
Remember kids, the RAs only give suggestions, turn that music on full blast at 11 pm and throw that dorm room party you're only a freshman once
My RA was so chill
new pfp???
2nd floor Taft 🔛 🔝
Speaker suggestions to accomplish this?
yuhhhh
so glad arson club is in agreement that we should be menaces
Always
why cwru:
Oscar was a good boy
huh
i think taplin 3 is the only coed corridor
The dog's name was also Oscar
thats wild
oscar-ception

He does look like an oscar
that was gonna be my next question
which one of you was the og
😂
:0 so ur oscar 2.0
oscar jr or the II
Oscar was also like only 2 years younger than me bc he was 18 when I was 20 💀
itâ€™s been coed the past 3 years i think
itâ€™s coed this year
He was almost the og og
Insider info
Which ones weren't coed
Ill be honest, I did not know dogs could live that long
We're talking each floor
ohhhh
Cutter was gender separated by floor
The suite based ones alternate between coed and single gender I think
Some will have like an all girls floor an all boys and a coed
https://tenor.com/view/among-us-gif-20239200
^
This may seem obvious. Plenty of people did Not do it
did *Not*?
interesting
Understandable please carry on
taplin 3 is the only coed corridor floor this year
way
i would forget that boys lived there tbh
bc i lived on the second floor and they were all the way on 4
Is this a common issue just in the dorms or in general?
Is anyone gonna be coming on campus by themselves
come to think of it
are girls even real
Depends on who you are, but itâ€™s definitely not uncommon. Please please please just talk to people like they are human beings I promise it makes life better
dw not my issue but important life lesson
i saw their boyfriends on our floor more than i did them
In my hs I knew people in my dorm because of A. our shared bathroom and B. the kitchen
so the quad style may interfere with my knowing people (I will cope)
Quad is tougher than racetrack for that yeah
theres a reason why the words for peers and friends tend to have roots relating to food (the people yearn for the kitchen)
but then again that is limiting in it helps with knowing *your* floor
bc people were always in the floor common rooms
Hold up high schools have dorms?
so they actually had an easier time making friends with people on their floor
boarding schools yes
And youâ€™ll make friends even if theyâ€™re not in your dorm. Most of my friends were scattered and we met at major interest events and in class mostly
^
i came to campus by myself
ayo I lived in my high school dorm too
same
this year
What 💀
long story
No sheets and no fan is crazy
could have used socks as pillow padding in the jeans but
prolly would not have had the energy
Ye I landed in Cleveland hopped into a cab and got straight onto campus😭
And it was in the midst of the august heat too
So unbelievably blessed to have my own apartment rn
it was so hot on move in day
I hope I get assigned a morning shift
Second
Who do weaven talk to

Thatâ€™s crazy
Iâ€™m so excited
7 days
Why a croissant
it was in my recents
Aight
very deep logic
:newitemacquired:
what that guy mean
:newitemacquired:
~~says who~~
simply keep lifting boxes
Probably explaining to people where to check in all day or smth
it rained 2 years ago
not fun
I mean at least ur not sweating??
🤓
gotta set a dramatic scene
It was two years ago I just remember being wet
It was a light and stormy day ...
It was a dark and stormy night
LMAO Adam
makes a better story: it was POURING, THUNDER CRASHING, THE TREES WERE SWAYING, A TORNADO WAS IN THE DISTANCE
i was there
I'm glad I live in a house with a basement
It rains a good bit. Have an umbrella and/or raincoat in ur backpack at all times
O-week midnight basement run because storms
Fiji's basement flooded some people's rooms 💀
stj has no basement
Or just ... deal with it
Warm rain is wonderful
Do u wear glasses
Then when it hits September, wear a hoodie and pretend
When like 80% of Greek life only signed up for morning shifts and the afternoon was hell
So real
Imaging having glasses 🤓
skill issue
Y'all are so mean smh
63% of American adults wear glasses
This is very good advice
does having good eyesight work against ones nerd status?
My vision is 20/15 and I keep getting told I'm a nerd, draw your own conclusions
my question is always. who are they polling
other factors of nerd-dom are strong enough in your case to compensate for your good eyesight
fun fact
What other factors
Seeing as how no response, I conclude I am not a nerd
QED
What does "knows much about nerds" mean
Imagine having fully functioning eyes
So here's the thing
I can name at least one person who is a strict superset of this
So at least I am not the ultimate nerd
just high up in the rankings
sounds like something an ultimate nerd would say
It was a survey of over 110,000 people by the census bureau for the national center of health statistics. It's skewed upwards by the elderly but not by that much
so other than me bullshiting words together on the spot, your ability to make polls targeting nerds (eg music kids) https://discord.com/channels/1198835515911327934/1266839078754717797/1271278222721421353
academia is the ultimate nerd activity
academia just tells me ur probably neurodivergent

See i only have half of these factors so clearly adam is the bigger nerd
You wear glasses and are literally from Ohio
I think it depends on how you talk about perfect pitch
Ryan Pitasky brought it up once and then 10 seconds later asked me why I always brought it up
So I consider it forced upon me
You and Jimmy are perfect pitch nerds but Annabel isn't one
What does a land full of corn and dispair have to do with me being a nerd
I'm sure you have other nerdy attributes
Off topic, but Iâ€™m too much of a dci fan, LETS GO BLOOOOOO
Pitas Ky Rya N is a fascinating man
Where will he be a Discord mod again in the near future
oop warrior cats? every warrior cats friend ive ever had was a massive nerd
I'm nearsighted
also hopefully I did not share anything that was best to be not shared
Nah ur good
If youd like i can lens you the first 7 arcs to read
What would be your warrior cat name Alex
See everyone, Alex's full home address is ||                                                         || which makes him a nerd - Axel
I'm pretty sure every warrior cats fan has thought about it
p much
Hereâ€™s his social too: ||       ||
Fine be that way
nerd behavior be like:
Naw naw naw you have to make the emptiness long enough to be realistic

Mobile user moment
I have two aliases for my Case email which are 2 characters each
Lmao don't worry it's okay
Also define â€œnerd musicâ€
Am I a nerd
I had some very silly things in my wattpad bio when I was 12
You have a discworld tattoo
It's a good tattoo
But it's a nerd tat
(If you have an Apple device that is)
If anyone could find my old Wattpad account you might as well just doxx me and steal my identity
Sometimes I forget this
will wood, helluva hotel, almost anything on a playlist youve shared w me

No i only have 3 voice memos and none are piano stuff

who is that again?
classic
Strong
Ooh lordy if y'all new people knew my music taste I would be called a nerd even more
not on spotify (the superior platform?)
Nerd, i see good songs just from seeing the first few, but nerd
solid songs on here
Literally how I feel when watching "what." on YouTube
makes cents, the evolution of songs added is great
The theoretical nonsense is cool tho
average nursing w
nursing is cool and makes moneys
yeah, although you have to specify which will wood you like nowadays
Excited to meet yâ€™all. Anyone who can see my monstrosity of a playlist and appreciate it is a strange but kindred soul
they're both pretty good but SELF-iSH remains my favorite
SAME
The best opinion
dude same
I'm excited to meet you too Jake
Thanks Adam and Eric itâ€™ll be so fun meeting you two
examining the playlist now jake
bill wurtz hell yeah
it is truly fascinating
most people i know have 'general' playlists over 24 hours
Imagine having playlists and not just listening to songs on YouTube
i have like 30 playlists lmao
100 +? (dont ask)
I made it for driving to/from work so itâ€™s a specific vibe of song for me. If Iâ€™m just relaxing, I like to use YouTube cause I like mashups perhaps a little bit too much and also thereâ€™s more variety
Although i should just make a playlist to have to say this is what i like
🥹â¤ï¸
or periods of time what you were listening to
... biting people???
Curious if anyone here will know who im talking about
music slapped but he shouldnt
His music got me through a lot 🥲
I have a sea shanty playlist, a playlist about entities in strange locations, songs that match the BPM of my cars turn signal, and a couple Emotion playlists,
Glee Club mentioned?
#3 based
not on purpose
My songs are a very strange list of ||rap, Corsican/Sardinian polyphony, Mongolian/Tuvan throat singing, Minecraft music, choral music, and Bach||
Those are the highlights
I donâ€™t particularly like the songs but they work. For context, Paul Revere by the Beastie Boys is an amazing song but probably 1-2 bpm off of my turn signal and it made me insane so I made a playlist to correct it. Also I had to have my turn signal on for like 5-10 minutes to get to school. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1AOzjXL6UMT2NZ7lvkSySC?si=3UIvy3xVTCi71GglHibb0Q&pi=u-WvwR2U5NTL67
minecraft music >
Check out D419
Goes crazy
It was more just so I could have satisfaction than for any actual listening reason
i know like one king gizzard song
gila monster, shanghai, kepler-22b
best imo
i have
- general
- crunchy music
- calm
- chill
- chill but also loud
- assorted character playlists
- assorted emotion playlists
- prog rock
- stuff i wrote
- minecraft but only the nether music
- forest boardgames
- assorted 'all the good stuff from this one artists'
- songs about nuking your hometown
- that one assignment i did for a MUGN class
- just king gizzard
- microtonality (mostly king gizzard)
- jazz fusion
- classical (really small rn :{)
- hardcore shit
- songs that got stuck in my head
- songs to play that make people who say 'you listen to weird music' reconsider their standards
songs about nuking your hometown @jschlanket
I think Iâ€™ve seen most of those
oh, and how could i forget
H u h
just ~~sounds like you~~
Will there be more listening parties this sem 😳😳😳
Yes please
what is forest boardgames
now iâ€™m curious
my music taste can be simplified very easily
never know when it could come in handy so its best to always be prepared

yeah exactly
https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/successful-songs-that-were-not-about-romance-mental/pl.u-4JomX5bTaDBL14o?ls
Seeing this made me remember that I did indeed listen to like 6 king gizzard albums
that means you've listened to 3/13ths of all their albums!
Hence why I need to listen to more before I see them live
that is, if ticketmaster ever gets those tickets to me
Guh
Fight them
i emailed them and they were like 'yeah, uh, just wait i guess idk'
Bruh
they said if it comes down to the day they can elevate the issue
Jeez ok
Ticketmaster L
3rd party shenanigans
Guh
We will figure it out ig
I am sleepy bedtime now though. Good night everyone
good sleep
go
I made a playlist just to captivate what i listen to so i can be called a nerd or not
Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/tunes/pl.u-aZb00R5t14KBRo6
Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0h55QFrcdZSVdmUcXAPocR?si=o9uLx5WvRTWNHDYBN88qRg&pi=u-VJh8oVnKQOWP
Same tbh I was expecting more from inside with how everyone was talking about it
I'm not a big playlist person
I usually listen to autogenerated YouTube mixes or full albums front to back
My music taste includes things like 
- various metal subgenres
- progressive rock
- indie pop 
- rap
- punk
- pop punk and post hardcore 
- a little folk 
- classic rock 
- electronic 
- emo rap specifically
Favorite bands currently includes alkaline trio, against me, pierce the veil, thornhill, rise against, silverstein, and incubus
I mean listening to an album front to back is just how it was intended so thats the way to do it
One of my friends claims it's "weird" but honestly I think he's the weird one
He's like "no one listens to an album all the way through" and I'm like "have you heard of a CD??"
Not listening to an album front to back makes people hate interludes which can be really good
I love interludes
That's one of my favorite things ever in songs
Where the ending of one seamlessly leads into the beginning of the next one
Fall out boy used to do some really awesome ones
Also green days American idiot album has some awesome combo songs where they're meant to be listened to as a pair
But yeah I guess I've just always been more of a full album listener
But sometimes it's nice to use a YouTube mix and listen to a little of a lot of things
Like "make a water themed playlist"
Or "choose 30 songs that fit these prompts"
:devious:
I love old fall out boy
I was obsessed with fall out boy from like 8th-10th grade
So maybe the same time frame as you actually
I really got into them around when mania came out
And then I saw them in the mania tour
I never liked fall out boy themselves but I liked a few songs
Especially the one they made for big hero 6
:lmao:
Sometimes i forget how few playlists i have, two autogenerated ones, christmas music, and the one i just made
Same, but tbh not a big fan of mania
I like about half of mania
But it encouraged me to go back into their catalog and realize that I actually liked their music all along
I remember going to my friend's birthday party and grooving to Uma Thurman without even knowing it was a fob song
But also i havent listened to mania in 2+ years so maybe that has changed, ill have to listen again
I like young and menace, stay frosty royal milk tea, the last of the real ones, wilson, church, heavens gate, and bishops knife trick
From mania
So maybe 2/3
But I like pretty much all of their songs from previous albums
So it's in a slightly lower esteem
There's a really beautiful instrumental cover of young and menace on YouTube somewhere
so much for stardust is actually so good tho
itâ€™s my favorite of post hiatus fob
I listened through it once or twice and it was pretty good
I don't have it in me to memorize all their new songs
I have a lot of other bands I like now
mania is better than american beauty/american psycho
When I used to be into fall out boy I only listened to like 3 b ands
american beauty/american psycho is my least favorite of their albums by far
okay hereâ€™s my ranking: 
1. folie a deux
2. from under the cork tree 
3. infinity on high 
4. so much for stardust 
5. take this to your grave 
6. save rock and roll
7. mania 
8. american beauty/american psycho 

but srar and mania are very close
My ranking would be:
1. folie 
2. infinity on high
3. from under the cork tree
4. save rock and roll 
5. American beauty American psycho 
6. take this to your grave
7. Mania
i think the top 3 in no particular order is something everyone agrees with
folie a deux is just the best one tho
As are infinity and cork tree
Lol I agree
Folie clears
i need to listen to cork tree again
solid album
fr
ahead of its time fr
bc now i swear every modern fob fan puts folie first
Also I cannot listen to any non deluxe edition fob album anymore
omg i was so happy when they put pavlove on spotify
I love that song so much
give us lullabye
And music or misery
same thing with dookie but i knew it existed
That Deftones secret song is fun too
I forget the album name
bc i used to listen to cds
and the one on nevermind is like 20 minutes after the end of the cd or something
With the deluxe edition songs cork tree gets much closer to infinity on high for me
But now you have glee club
WHICH CAME FIRST
The music or the misery 🤠
i definitely donâ€™t know what every song sounds like based on the title
but i know all of them
Their believers never die special songs are cool too
the lake effect kid ep is good too
One thing that's cool about fall out boy. Their line up doesn't change
Ooo yeah lake effect kid is nice
At one point in my life I knew the album name and lyrics to every fob song
evening out with your girlfriend may have been diff i donâ€™t remember
I'm not even sure if it was diff
I think once Hurley joined for grave then it was a stable line up
yeah i was about to say
my heart will always be the bside to my tongue is just elite
you plowed through like 8 rangers apprentice books in one week, taking breaks only to think about linear algebra and maybe the witch of edmonton. i rest my case.
So true
they recorded it shitfaced brooo
who listens to pax am days is my question
I try to forget about pax
Love will tear us apart is a nice song to listen to
there are some good songs on pax
it is a joy division Cover
Well yes, but it's still nice to listen to
true
my fav on that ep is itâ€™s not a side effect of the cocaine
The band erra has a fantastic cover of Stockholm syndrome by muse and I like the bad omens cover of come undone
Mine is music or the misery lol
true
big mouth strikes again by placebo > the smiths
i just love placebo
where r my placebo lovers
for a while i liked their cover of running up that hill better than the og too
But yeah I like these two more than the ogs
no one does </3
Tetrarch is one of the obscure bands I like
I'm trying to think of the name of one band but it escapes me
crazy in a good way
brian molko (of placebo) in the 90s as a cis man
heâ€™s an icon, a legend
Good for him
I like the band greyhaven who is pretty niche
I saw them at a local concert once
Very cool experience
The singer appreciated how into their music me and another guy were and he let us sing into the mic for a bit 😎
woah
The band Reside is another really niche band I used to listen to a lot
Wdym by same
like
Like more than once?
I've seen see you space cowboy, silverstein, and beartooth all more than once
iâ€™ve been to: twenty one pilots, swmrs (ew), fob, pvris, alanis morrissette, samia, lucy dacus, mitski, a local band called rather nice, a local band called litvar, and hozier
and i think thatâ€™s all
maybe
They were called glee club ironically though, they described themselves as a mathcore band and had a song called "collecting teeth" among others
math rock is so good
It would take me a minute to list all the bands I've seen but I'll try
fun fact! the drummer is actually billie joe armstrongâ€™s oldest son!
That's not very 9 o-clock on a Saturday of him
samia is the one i saw headlining and opening
she opened for lucy
i saw lucy and mitski 4 days apart too
Bands and artists I've seen in concert:
Bon Jovi, machine gun kelly, fall out boy, cypress hill, hollywood undead, wristmeetrazor, vatican, greyhaven, see you space cowboy, the plot in you, silverstein, beartooth, the devil wears prada, killswitch engage, third eye blind, taking back sunday, manchester orchestra, jimmy eat world, dayseeker, pierce the veil, blink 182
At music festivals:
Eve 6, hoobastank, rob Thomas, Carlos Santana, neon trees, Rachel platin, Dean Louis
i was at barricade for swmrs lucy and mitski
Yikers
I could be forgetting one as well. I've seen many concerts
i donâ€™t tend to enjoy them too much bc i get overwhelmed
but now i love her
And sublime with rome
mitski is the best one iâ€™ve seen
sheâ€™s incredible live
INCREDIBLE
That's fair. I usually have earplugs to help me but I enjoy myself
i usually just wanna go home
if i have a seat im usually better
I enjoy moshing
Which colors my perspective
There are very few rushes in life quite like throwing down in the mosh pit
iâ€™ve seen the arcadian wild (wanted to see them; enjoyed it greatly) and hippo campus (friends birthday; overstimulated; sat in the back and read lotr)
I definitely understand how concerts can be not fun for some people
The only social media app I will use from now on
Hell yeah. Baby gravy goes crazy
Will be eating good
I did not know I needed manny Reddit until now
Raves
Idk I am man of duality love moshing also big edm fan
Subway 7 times a week
Is an actual godsend
https://tenor.com/view/elmo-elmos-fire-elmo-fire-fire-yas-gif-16440807891622620439
the ~45 min wait time prevented me from going to subway more often than not
Unless you plan it strategically into your schedule
Itâ€™s the opposite side of campus

wait what thats cruel
So like if u order during class u can prob pick it up when ur class is over
Correct. If itâ€™s on Euclid, it might accept case cash but meal swipes are all on campus
gotcha I see
was too good to be true 😪
Ngl yall need to start playing Roblox poker, I made 5k in-game chips in one day
I think I would find a rave to be overstimulating lol

Are you an international student Oscar?
ya
same
but itâ€™s definitely been a thing since at least my sophomore year
but maybe you skipped it
Probably lmao, most internationals are fob so Iâ€™d assume this is new
it was a thing our year
just looked back at the schedule
6 days until I'm in ohio
what kind of visa do you have
Ohio approaches rapidly
Ohio
Also, my international status may be changed soon 😃👍🏼
F1
Pretty sure J1 is like foreign exchange program so no way it goes over a year
postively or negatively
Positively
Iâ€™m getting married soon😁👍🏼
Yooo congratulations dude
New Oscar lore fr
Nah Iâ€™m just kidding 💀
D:
Weâ€™d be none the wiser (Iâ€™m a dumbass)
D:
😭
Despite living right next to phi psi I've actually met very few of them
Pretty sure I've never met Oscar either
oscar will forever look like machamp in my head
am I just comic sans on a white background to you
i have FEELINGS
thats just his lvl 1090u42590438509348 nerd aura
â€¦.
I do think we have a picture of Oscar somewhere, but not intentionally, at one point phi psi used an old composite to write bathroom fixing requests on our shared one's door 😭
the feelings: CaWU (in comic sans font)
What does CaWU mean
^
Creative and Witty Username
Lol
Case ass western reserve
Am I a yawning Umbreon to you all
ah the most creative and witty
Obviously
Ah well that one is correct
Can confirm-- Charlie is a yawning Umbreon
charlie face reveal 😳
Hey we don't make the rules, pfp=you
michael, you were right
iâ€™ve met oscar many times
every time we see eachother we glare at eachother itâ€™s a little routine we have
https://youtu.be/XTkO1zsfeE8?si=Lw5KdOe-i4UqCh_o
me fr
I love how Iâ€™m the only one that has an actually photo as a pfp
we just clicked fr
yes but it is you as younger version so it half counts
Smh imagine using an actual photo of u
Ngl I thought your pfp was this guy
Get on my level, create an idealized drawing of urself using picrew
I literally only use discord for this server
When was the first time we met, I'm not actually certain 😭
Yeah I use this discord account for too many things for it to be generally traceable back to me
passover lunch at hillel
Oh so true
and then we talked for over an hour
I have him irl
Iâ€™m just a big fan of machamp
you should go itâ€™s so fun and you get food

Machamp shoes
He looks so squishable
Nice
and yeah I'll pull up for sure
When
i very openly like you at chabad
uhh i went to a couple of shabbats and like one holiday (honestly forgor which)
hey!
itâ€™s the patrilineal life
you draw that?
True I mean I have plenty of friends who also go there but they side eye patrilineal Jews yeah
oh do people actually care about that
yall are jews if you wanna be
Ye
stay winning
they do bc theyâ€™re hasidic
wow its good
i see
Sorry 😔 in my defense I experience cute aggression a lot
It's so funny being a patrilineal Jew because non-jews see your last name and think you're a super mega Jew but orthodox Jews will see you as not a real one 😭😭
This is a dumb question, are there different Jewish denominations?
||the rabbi told my bf he should date a jewish girl while he knew we were in a relationship||
Me too, I smush my squishmallows with love
no but itâ€™s like. levels of observance
no more lil michael??
In a manner of speaking, most simply there's orthodox, conservative, and reform
bruh
Why are things so cute they dont have to be that cute???
itâ€™s not like different jews believe different things, itâ€™s based on what rules you follow
yeah so!
Yeah it's not really like the differences between Christian or Muslim sects
yeah thatâ€™s just judaism
two jews three opinions
Lmao yeah
itâ€™s a religion built on arguing 😭
we are so good at it
yeah
I'm quite reform and mostly observant for holidays
and which means every now and then I'll say a yiddish word that I thought was widely known and get looked at funny
Freshman year I taught a bunch of my friends what chametz was 😭
as in. i celebrate the holidays
but i consider that more of a cultural thing
Yeah I'm similar to Hannah in that regard
ye same here
but i grew up with only chanukah
and not all 8 days
i grew up with hanukkah and the high holidays and then whatever they'd do at sunday school (and passover but only for a day; my family likes bread too much)
my mom is catholic and my dad is jewish but not very religious
so yeah
There is quite a lot of diversity to the Jewish experience
a jew is a jew is a jew
I actually grew up nominally Buddhist but it was more of a cult thing
no its a good convo

you never know what youll bring up
you just get 3 jews in a conversation and we start yapping
Kind of real
we love yapping
we will banter about anything
fr
Other shoe is hariyama
good food and good conversations are the best things i've taken away from judaism personally
Challah 😁👍🏼
I agree with that plus questioning everything and thinking critically
Also hamentaschen
true
sometimes the chabad rabbi just calls my bf (who is graduated) and yaps
i gotta head out for rn, but nice talking to yall. Hopefully I'll find the courage to go to more Jewish events and stuff next sem and can meet yall there
I hope so too, have a nice day Jake
I should probably get to doing some other things as well
the temptation of discord fr
me too i have like 50 door decs to make and a bulletin board to do
gl gl
and i have to email my supervisor and write a paper
just uh minor things yk
I use pencil first then trace with sharpie
Iâ€™m playing overwatch
yes
â€¦ youâ€™ve met me in real life
Yeah, and?
smiling child has now grown up to become spiderman
No, Dr Pepper
shlouse
😭
You are not going to like this abswer
are you saying you see yourself as dr pepper alex
Even better, what is it
So you see me as him, interesting
wait omg happy birthday adam
Adam birthday??
Yo thanks
Happy birthday mr red lightning
Thank you Mr. Math + CS â€˜28
What do you see me as
Happy Hutchday ye lad of lads
:0 woahg congrats you've aged 🎉
All i ever think about is the analog horror edit you did of that 2 pixel image of you
Thatâ€™s what i see in my ming
oh youâ€™re like right by the birthday cutoff huh. a couple friends from high school turned 20 recently and theyâ€™re in my grade
A Discord chat with that as the icon just gave me a notification for the first time in a week
Speak of the devil
@hellspells @hicinserenomen thanks yâ€™all
im simply majin buu to most of you
I summoned it back to life
besides axel
Even though I know what you look like you still look like a nebula / constellation / whatever that cloud of dust was sometimes
I see you as your insta pfp, atleast ive always assumed its you
You kids and your instant grams
You have an insta
I will someday
I believe in you
update
Does not have his name if I remember correctly, so thatâ€™ll be an issue
Everyones insta is traceable once you learn enough
â€¦ um
I just need to learn niche things about adam and hope theyre in his username
not me I just know name and accounts they might follow
Do they provide paper and arts and crafts stuff or are you on your own
they provide everything
You see there are so many axels that attend cwru so Im practically unfindable fr
adam I think you should have a meet and great during orientation week
including cricuts
all you upperclassmen actually
thats what move in time is for
us to find the discord students 😰?
actually there will be a lotta people so it may prove difficult
i think most of the upperclassmen here will be at move in
a lot of them are greek and iâ€™m an RA
so greek info session?
greek chapters help with move in
We just help with move in
We can just organize a party to hunt him down and swarm him
so down
"hey I'm ____ and I'm crhoncially online discord"
I'm not egotistical enough to think that an Adam meet and greet would be a good idea
YES OMG
What's been suggested before is a 28 server meetup
the hunt for adam is on
TRUE
window
and we can just stand outside?
3rd floor
trees?
i think i might have card access to where you live
but i am not allowed to use it unless im going there for my job
Probably
Wait do RAs really have card access anywhere??????
hannah you should lead this witchunt
Just find me during move in
Maybe I'll even move one of y'all in
🫡 the hunt will be on in 7 days
Are you going to face reveal before move in or am i just going to be one of the few who know you are you
We'll see
You tryna help me move in to waldorf 😎
Usually there's an all-Greek-life event that happens during o-week
birds are done being glued
Everyone has name bird now
Out of context reading that was crazy
They will not be special
They will not get bird
no they were done with a cricut
i will have to make more bird
jwst eagle nebula <3
💀
In literally almost a decade
i just wanna spectate
very sudden
curious, how many of you read the textbooks for classes?
1
you can find them all online right?
its wild how many hormones act on the kidneys
some girl i gave a tour to today found my linkedin AS I WAS TOURING HER 😭 
terrifying....
NO WAY
LMFAO
LMFAO thats so good
Less than a week, boys
â€¦
Not two days
Iâ€™m currently packing and watching SpongeBob
Hello what
it got attacked before so you can swoop in and save it
🤩🤩🤩
I just want to do college thanks!
case is in good shape and every building has power afaik. its more some places in the suburbs
like some places in bedford
D: I would like no storm during o week thank u very much
so i got to stay cozy in bed :)
literally me on the 6th floor of triangle
tornado watch is bedtime. tornado warning is get out of bed time
but i was so eepy,,, and my hubris so strong
you are stronger than the storm
that one touched down on like 85th and euclid btw
For move in Iâ€™ll be working the afternoon shift at juniper
Yo same 😕
Iâ€™m morning at clarke
😢😢
If itâ€™s that itâ€™s morning I will gladly switch
Iâ€™d rather do magnolia or something
Okay
Yâ€™all are abandoning me in the morning 😭
They assign us and we have no choice
I am excited to be moved in and done early in the day
That makes one (1) of us
Is contenza  good at twaching
Terriâ€™s good
just got an email from my RA, anyone know who Fish is? I have questions lol
@makerofmemes
aha
RAAAA FISH MENTIONED

😂😂
Fish is the goat if fishes were goats
Same
Grindset
hallo fish
Wait so you are saying one could hypothetically track down Adam Jake AND Charlie at the same time
(Thank you move in gods)
Fish is a Capricorn confirmed???

Hell yeah
I think fish has a birthday in the first half of the year
Hypothetically yes
Fish is a god amongst men
Fish is a Leo
Fish day is August 2nd
does anyone know where the hearing and speech center is?
what?
I SAID
THE HEARING AND SPEECH CENTER
guys, i think this guy needs to go to the hearing and speech center for a check up
117th and euclid
basically just keep walking up euclid on the north side of the street and you will find it
Oh cool thz
its at the pin on the map
WHAT?
I.
SAID.
god, is this man 20 or 200
*AHEM*
THE
HEARING
AND
SPEECH
CENTER
I'M 21 ACTUALLY
OH GOOD FOR U
GET A DRINK FOR ME SOME TIME?
HAHA THAT'S ILLEGAL
SSSSSHHHHH
GOVERNMENT IS A LIE
MAYBE ASK THE PEOPLE AT THE HEARING AND SPEECH CENTER IT'S THE BEST BAR NEAR CAMPUS
wait seriously?
🤣
thatd be funny
the best bar is next to the sensory disabled place
a lil pity bar for u to drink ur woes away
🤣
ANYWAY, ZACCCCCCCCC, U PLAY ANY SPORTS?
FISH IS LOVELY!!!
big win
41 residents 🥰🥰🥰
... wow
where are you RAing
Jake.
adam
I messaged another RA on Discord exactly this about 30 seconds ago
MM1B
TRUE TRUE TRUE
STJ
oh nice
luxury RA
how long is thanksgiving break?
4 days (Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday)
Woahg awesome to know I've got a super cool and awesome person as my ra
@makerofmemes iâ€™m gonna make u a bird
fish bird

why you saying wow
yay! a birb :]
he was surprised that adam and i share a braincell
So riddle me this Jake
Academic equivalent of dookie
Red is history
red??
Yellow is English
history is yellow
Green is Science
english red
Hell nah
No way English is red
#polls channel 🥺
thanks
Hold on
Itâ€™s black
agree
Bro youâ€™re tripping
What r yall on
Meth
Exactly!
I actually agree here
Yellow for history!?
Blasphemy
Nah bro red for history
yes
WHY WOW
Red = bloodshed
Justify yellow being history. Iâ€™ll wait
Actually yeah red I can get behind
Jake and I shared a braincell
Bruh green = science
green = history
Yes specifically chemistry
the person Directly above me placed something on their floor
explosive device
But I see the debate for bio
literally every textbook ive had lol
Real
Was Jake
Ignoring that my history textbook was blue
stj has grown on me
i will be planting c4 in your bed in... `5` days
physics is definitely not green aint no way
Not if I get ya first dw
NO
Okay Mr. Discord mod
exactly
history yellow
Wait wait wait conspiracy time
Hell nah
Yellow is like a happy color or something
History is never happy
It'll always be blue for me but red is acceptable
Why not
They can be same color but not at the same time
Hey now
Sound logic
yeah but im goin vibes based
Thats my major
can't wait until y'all are taking two classes or more of the same subject
... good point
same (in the sense that notebooks will be whatever i can get my grubby hands on), i think ill be using a few of the same color of notebooks but like some are more worn than others so it should be fine
i need two nice and big notebooks and then three of whatever i can scrounge up
@makerofmemes r u excited for 9:30 start tmw
id take all of it
@reddishlightning are real analysis or abstract classes where graph paper would be useful?
👀
Ooo notebooks hand em over
If wanna fly to nm and then ship textbooks to CLE, all urs (see thatâ€™s the catch)
there are few luxuries in life and one of them is independent time in the morning (iâ€™m independently in my bed)
i would eat them
Good fiber fr
laying in bed after i wake up in the morning is such a pleasure for me i will intentionally set an earlier alarm so i have more laying in bed awake time
same thoughhhhhh
iâ€™m done with Almost all of my stuff
9:30 classes good. 8:25 evil
Mmm clinicals
7 am evil
Clinicals 😭
The discord can write it for u
make a meet the RA flyer but its just information about cats
Even better than AI
fun fact: i have seven residents on the second floor and half of the third floor
cursed information
I have cool cat that youâ€™ll never meet
stay mysterious
Weird
i promise you they do not care who i am
That is so bizarre
Come to my room, my roommate might get to bring his (eventually)
Just randomly drop hannah lore on them for fun
wait youre in smith too right
that makes everyone gasp
My grandpa * kinda * looks like Bernie Sanders (if you squint)
I'm in Smith! :DDD
^ put that on there
what time are y'all juniper folk moving in
What.
Nah cutler (the cult)
noon
9 am :3
ok ill be there my shift is from 12-4:30
12
woo same time
adam, charlie, and I will be there at least
fish will be present
YEAH FISH
Alex and Axel + Michael? Will be there
who all is in juniper
Ready moved in so all the more time to find yall
i know iâ€™ll Be There
i arrive after movein 😔
You will Be There?
but iâ€™m not a freshman RA so im just vibes ig
How'd u already move in????
(Not yet, the 17th, I was unclear lmao)
Ohhhh cool
Iâ€™m moving in first thing on Sunday
So you can be at juniper at 12?
when i was a freshman we had two move in days bc of covid
and it was nice
i moved in on the saturday
and i got to just Observe
Probably
ill be there
it was way less chaotic
Me when Iâ€™ve already met Mushin irl 😎😎
2 days of move in should be standard I think it'd be way better
Gotta keep you guessing
bc you would have to staff 2 days
True true
yes
Flat

yep
correct
tfw summer job 😔
ill have a few people to help me avoid the awkwardness 🙏🏾
the awkwardness persists. it's cwru
if you think you are awkward you are probably normal by campus standards
you do have to move in
move out then move in
i think i've met more autistic people here than anywhere else in my life combined and i used to go to a program for autistic children
if you think you're normal here then you are probably autistic
😭
i have no idea if im normal or if i was normal in high school im just here
Think itâ€™s an application requirement
I think by and large CWRU students are a bit odd
^
Not me I'm downright mundane
Yes I have to agree with Charlie for once
You are high up there in the linguology rankings
Lmao. Don't tell the new students about the hivemind
Tsk tsk I'm affronted
Ive already been made aware
It's okay to be a bit of a silly goose
This is a safe space
I aim to make it not so
All will be lampooned
Beatings will continue until morale improves
You are all jesters in my eternal court
Yâ€™all are in luck move in is right on time with the tail end of the feast of the assumption
🤷🏾â€â™‚ï¸
Maybe there is a fire going on?
Somebody probably farted
Yo only 136? Best day in California August
(California still #1 btw)
girl davis is at 29 rn
itâ€™s 78 by campus
WE STAY WINNING
okay thats an improvement
Wild fires in Canada right now, so that might be why
This, guys who was it fess up
Literally 1774
well i mean. if things are on fire in california its logical to assume california is the source of its own fire related woes
if things are not on fire in ohio its harder to blame ohio for that

I present for your consideration the river
thats so true
river could catch on fire again at any moment
RedBull is a complete meal Sophie
Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m saying
So polluted it caught on fire at least 14 times
15th time coming soon
I love how I wrote that message like 2 hours ago and it just now sent
I love Discord too
Especially when it double sends everyone pings
The leutner bathroom
Wait Luenter has a bathroom???
Yeah?
yeah lmao
It's right before you enter
bro not the leutner misspelling
fwiw i also haven't been in there for two years
fax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTX1lI8COuQ
You mean "chapell in gs ass tupe idco seuct"?
The mispronunciation gets me the most
its pronounced lootner
Freshmen: it is LOIT-NER
NOT LOOT-NER
it's lober
:lober:
We're off to a great start...
Actually, why not just call the food Hall lobster that is more based
Intro to ASL
did you guys know that MIT also uses bon appetit
Eugh
bon appetit has infected many universities
I'll do that when I get to campus
but its even in los angeles getty center's food court
I'm sure I can find
A version of the textbook
But the video?
I'm probably gonna have to buy that 😭
RMP and reddit say intro to ASL is a fun class
So I'm hoping that's true
Hw before the semester even starts is not a great sign though 😭
one thing to take into consideration is that people who take a language course are more likely to be doing so because they are interested in the subject which will mean higher enjoyment of the class
Abstract is up but no content
😦
THESE VIDEOS R $90???
Bro
😭😭😭
I genuinely might
Change the class
with how much college already costs you would think course material like that would be provided for us
I might do the same here
Send them an email and ask if thereâ€™s any way to get it for cheaper
Same
well if youâ€™re taing (?) i feel like that makes sense

Welp

THANK YOU SO MUCH
@.littlejimmy would you perhaps have 121 and 122 available?
🫠
Iâ€™m pretty sure they force you to pay for the 1st day ebook
for a book that I will probably never use 💀
im ngl i might use my old hs teachers calc google sheet planner
Do you all know if the Econ 102 textbook is like that? (Do I have to actually pay full price for it)
On-the-job training
Yes but it'd be embarrassing if I just end up not understanding it after I went through the process of getting hired
If anything it would be embarrassing for them
It's their job to make sure people they hire can do the job
why are so many campus jobs asking for a cover letter what on earthhh
lowkey if they let you in with no prior experience lmk bc id love to learn to sew and if i can get paid to practice so much the better
😭
@saha_d @kgir06 major twins???
in general how is it double majoring at case?
i have a bunchhh of ap credit for basically everything rn i think?
ooh i see i see
If you have questions I can probably get answers
im mostly nervous abt balancing the major reqs with the gen eds
Anyway we love math majors around here
yay :D
ahhh that makes sense
How much AP credit do you have?
some of the gen eds can be completed by courses in the major requirements
i think thats all that is accepted that i took
how about the like random ones? like the phys ed/ethics stuff?
😭 😭
some of the ethics and communications stuff can be completed by a course called ENGR399
ahh okok
You can do "phys ed" along the lines of CPR training
The problem is finding a convenient one that you will enjoy
oh :0 that sounds fun!
that makes sense lolol
History, English, and government all have additional course requirements you have to take before you receive credit. But calc 1/2, physics, and psych is a good start
If you enjoy the gym weightlifting pe is chill as hell
yeah thats what i saw, im doing the hist seminar this sem hopefully
Literally just show up, sign in, do your own workout at your own pace, then you're good
ooh thats cool! i might try to do that then
Most pe classes are somewhat similar
Just show up and do whatever the class is for 30-50 minutes
ahh thats so nice to hear lol
i think bs?
oh actually?
The ba requires less classes
ahh lol
is one more useful than the other?
Well
i know theyre super different but i genuinely have no clue which id prefer and they're both fields i love
But the former might burn you out ...
Anyway try to use this year to figure a bit out
If you're interested in a normal MechE job try getting certified at Thinkbox
BS will require around 12 or 13 courses on top of meche, while BA will need 8 or 9
And tech electives lol
yeah i was gonna try to do that, i know how to use a good number of machines bc of frc, but i wanted to fs get formal certifications
That's why I said strict 🤓â˜ï¸
is there a lot of overlap w cs classes?
ahh i see i see
Lmao. I'm like halfway done
are bs majors generally just more rigorous?
might have to replan out my schedules with a ba then lmao
i see i see
ahh
woah thats so cool
They're usually more scientifically rigorous
The ones Adam mentioned plus calc 1-3, physics 1 and 2, linear algebra, number theory, and maybe more (?)
i see i see
thats so nice
But I think it is for the cs BS
Yes
Where I think the CS BS requires more science and CS courses over the ba as well, but I'm less familiar with the requirements
i see i see
+Calc III, +Linear Algebra, +6 CS courses (and maybe some physics as well not sure)
yeah that makes sense
Like heat transfer I bet you could convince them
The extra classes required won't add much for you considering your science breadth needed for meche anyway, and they may make it challenging for you to graduate on time
its for like 3 of the 6 right?
3/6 for BS, 1/3 for BA
ahh
If the BS ends up being viable for you, it's pretty easy to switch around between them
But I'd recommend aiming for the BA
yeah that makes sense
woah
wait oh also i was looking at the math + physics
or like considering it
You definitely can't do that and meche at the same time. Lol
Well you could try. But it wouldn't be fun
ahh😭  i kinda assumed that'd be the case
Then again case western is a school of people who push boundaries
I know of a living legend who did a mech e degree and a CS BS double major and graduated on time
I'm pretty sure he's the reason why we have a hard maximum on the credits you can take in a semester
i might talk with my advisor to see if itd be possible? im not sure how much more useful it'd be, but i really like physics haha
danggg what
thats crazy
If you're super indecisive between math, physics, and engineering right now . . . Don't worry about it. Just take your first semester of classes and see what you like
They all have very similar first year expectations
Aside from engr 130 for engineering majors
okok cool
What is it
ooh! what made you change your mind?
Charlie discovered the light is what
Calc 3, physics 2, chem 111 and ?
its calc 3, acct100, engr130, and chem111
physics was full when i checked, so i have to wait till next sem for that
and im on the linear wl, and submitted a form to take the history seminar
Wait for people to drop tbh
With which professor
Or permission request
ahh that makes sense yeah
i did a permission request for it yeah
You could also take EMAE165 maybe, it helps you get certified at some TBX things I think
erkki somersalo
*cough* emae166
Shoot
Are the other ones full?
ooh thats cool
uhh all of them are full
but two sections worked w my schedule
that one and uhh
Meckes usually accepts linear algebra permissions requests
Yeah I was going to say
Also he is quite highly regarded for linear algebra
I hear @reddishlightning is a big fan of him
Trial by fire
eva belmont's is the other one that worked
Actually wait I bet Meckes overlaps with 111
Yeah okay
@quinsential is Belmont nice
Were* 😔
May she rest in peace
ahh i see i see
*sweats in linear 3rd abstract 5th*
yeah that makes sense
Linear algebra does double duty as proofs boot camp at CWRU
would it be like
I would not recommend it
Anyone going to envision weekend?
i see i see
What adjustments?
Not everyone must follow the same path. I for one will be taking ENGR 145 seventh
that makes sense i suppose
I might be taking gen chem lab in my last semester lmao
You are already ahead if you have credit for calc 1 and 2
Adam is going to say you should take 19 credits and some 300 level classes
ahh i see
if you overload you can drop with no consequences
Please do not take 7 classes as a freshman
and this is only during your freshman year
You can continue to speak . . . For now
I mean 6 3/4 credit classes
that makes sense
By that other metric I was "taking 9 classes" Fall 2023 which is definitely not correct
Lmao
Singer moment
yeah, i guess thats what spring sem would look like
6 three credit classes, 2 pe courses, a musical ensemble, and a different one credit course
which sounded weirdly low?
16/17 is fine
haha, would linear maybe just not be great for that next class?
Yeah
Probably not
See if you can get physics 2
That one will be good for you
phys would be ideal yeah
You will definitely* be able to get into physics
enough people hopefully drop it?
Lots of people drop physics lol
Also if you send a permission request they're likely to expand lab sections
oh thats cool
So people drop it because it's not urgent for them to complete it
One of my friends is a civil engineering major and he's put off taking physics 2 for over a year lol
Ngl I'm going to see if I can get the field course I took this summer to count towards my majors bio requirement
yeah
oh i see
whats the diff between 121 and 123?
123 is meant for physics majors or ppl who like physics, is invite only, and is more rigorous + has extra topics
it kinda just expects u to know everything already
Gnarly, how does one get an invitation?
Email dr Martens
5 on AP physics exam Iâ€™m pretty sure
Ya he will prob let u in if u want in
We covered chaos and fractals and stuff in addition to the normal physics mechanics topics
I'll have to look into what those words are.
And u have to do 2 different labs than the normal physics lab
Definitely take calc 1 first
Like 100000% take it first
Alright bet bet, planning for 123 sophomore year then.
Don't wait that long
Especially for ee
Please
Ya
U gotta take e&m as well
Im in a bit of an awkward situation taking pre-calc this semester.
And e&m is kinda important for EE and I think is a pre req
Take physics 1 second semester and physics 2 third semester
Agree
You're in a rough position because of starting in pre-calc because of how much electrical engineering depends on physics 2, but as long as you take courses strategically from the beginning you'll probably be okay
But definitely don't wait any longer than you absolutely have to to take those physics classes
The only worry I mainly have is not having the foundations to succeed in physics since ive heard its so brutal.
Like what makes 121/123 so dreadful?
Thatâ€™s lowkey it
grading
123 was super easy grading and workload
but my friends in 121 complained about the hw, the TAs grading hw harshly, and it just being difficult in general
but itâ€™s kinda biased bc most ppl in 123 are good at physics so like naturally they find it easier
That makes sense, however its probably best advised not to take Cal 1 with 123 then
Definitely not
Very unfortunate but understandable.
Like itâ€™s not that involved
That'll be a new experience, definitely not used to average based grade scaling.
Oh right on, I'll be just fine then 🙂
I had a bit of a rough time with physics 1 and found physics 2 to be way easier, but most of my friends feel the opposite
Its been awhile since I've done calculus so I definitely appreciate the advice on whats best.
So what differentiates physics 1 and 2 to where one may be easier than the other?
Physics 2 requires a lot more visualization in 3D
At least that was my experience with 124
That makes sense, very interesting.
Thank you for answering my potentially silly questions that may have already been answered like 70 million times.
It's okay
You're welcome
If you're over 21, let me get you a beer at the blue sky brews.
or if you dont drink, at least a coffee
or tea.
goes for yall too @reddishlightning @divergencepoint
Gotcha, no problem. I figured I'd offer anyways since you guys have been so helpful. It's greatly appreciated.
Iâ€™ve found her to be nice and a brilliant mathematician but as an advisor thereâ€™s some work to be done
i am so late but omg hi
i was invited simply for taking ap phys but that was also âœ¨3 years agoâœ¨
and i took ap phys 2 algebra based
I think I was invited to take phys 123 but decided against it
bc this was before scores
i decided against it because i knew it was not for me
i think they try to cast a wide net for the invitations
Hey guys what did you get on AP Complex Analysis
I got a 4 :(
CHARLIE
WHEN WILL YOU ARRIVE
-4.13+2.81835i
Nah you're fine lol I was just providing helpful info to the freshies
Saturday morning
I got a 6
by the end of my time up there i was counting down the days fr
Not proud of that score tbh
I could afford it if I paid in installments but I'm not gonna do that lmao
i made one but it was a treat and also i have hella savings from the summer
Although once i get my refund from case i may do it since all i did was save this summer
i was prob going to go early alum anyway
i got a lot of Things
I always found it interesting that y'all just had seniors decide to have alum status

what?
what does that mean
Your status
Come to north side 🥺🥺🥺
Who's winning amogus
Adam is always the imposter
theres an among us game going on??
I mean hes red and red is always sus so not shocking

LOL
Yes
yes! still got it
but yeah I get the vibe
Tyler stop being nosy about people you *have* met
Like theoretically it's $60 a month if I pay in installments but
Who knows maybe I'll get fired or something idk


:WOAH:
The idea of this job is terrifying I'm ngl
Itâ€™s better to sink than sink in the sink
what job is that?
Costume shop assistant
oh wow!
that sounds really fun
if u learn to sew can u teach me so i can make myself a cloak
https://i.imgur.com/LQXwnI2.png
:yippe:
i am constantly scouring campus groups for thinkbox sewing tool training
please do
🫡
ty <3

Cloak
working on costumes sounds cool
I just am not confident whatsoever that i'd be decent at it
Gotta start somewhere
would be much nicer to have on my resume than mcdonalds
:peeposmile:
Guys who is Suzanne mason
or how about 3
Less than 4.1
^ Exactly. Because professors tend to write self-reviews.
Do you have to stay in your dorm during discover week
Or can I like stay with my parents till classes start
I mean why would you write an oddly specific rating about how an professor teaches the course.
This is the only thing they've ever done for me financially though
But we paid for those
I think people who have strong feelings sometimes post multiple reviews
People are also biased and opinionated about things
You're probably not going to get an objective view on things from anonymous reviews
So saying not believing everything on rmp is misleading and just not true
"don't believe everything you read on rmp" is quite literally true. Not everything that is written there is factual, there are lots of outdated and biased reviews, and your experience will not necessarily align with the people who post on the site. That's not to say that rate my professor is completely useless- there is usually helpful information there, but it's important to analyze it critically and take things with a grain of salt
My favorite professor at Case has a 1.1 on rmp so there is a likelihood of bullshit as well
Jeremy has a lot of haters
so yeah def take rmp with a grain of salt
landed in Cleveland
why's it hotter than I expected 😭
oh god 🤣
you will experience the nicest most perfect weather for half the day and then it'll snow enough to cancel school
It's toasty in August and some of September
wait guys where do i get my physical id
i'm coming from a tropical climate and have only experienced snow once 💀
in two days
17th
the orientation guide says: "Students moving in on August 18: Check in at the Maltz Performing Arts Center
Students that moved in PRIOR to August 18: Stop by the Info Booth between Wade Commons and Leutner Dining Hall."
wheres that 😭
so between Wade commons and Leunter *I think*
good luck 🫡
no wheres the orientation guide NASDISOADJSA
ty 🫡
you will experience it soon
if you go to the move in page youll find it
gimme a minute and ill find the link

pretty excited
Make sure to have good winter gear
Snow boots and a good winter coat at least
get puffers from aritzia
but their puffers r good
@mudrocker whatâ€™s the coldest youâ€™ve been in
have fun and gl
my winter gear consists of a hoodie and long pants 💀
northface is pretty good too
its so over dude
northern japan in December
Maybe Nov 15 if you stretch it
oh boy
its like korean weather rly
Seriously, get a good winter coat and boots 💀
I'll make sure to stock up 😭
i can donate some of my hand/toe warmers
Ngl finding a good winter jacket has been a struggle
NORTHFACE
im telling u
haha than me I'll keep that in mind if I'm actually dying
oh yeah my big jacket is from them
common wisconsin w
nah but esp if ur coming from tropical climate
I've definitely hoodied up in light snows
thats not enough
im not talking about light snow
cuz thats light
but not heavy ones
its waterproof but has a puffer layer I think?
finally cracking open my courses syllabi btw 💀
did u finish ur modules yet
or did u not touch those either
those are out..???
true but why did I procratinate
some for nursing yes
ah I see
For some but probably not most
yepp
Just finished the bls module
ITS SO LONG
are those the drugs/alcohol ones
D:
yayyy
nursing has more some for a clinical portal on safety (think hippa, osha, blood born pathogens ect) then one more recent for basic life support certification from american heart association
I hope 😒
trust
ohhh that makes sense
oh yeah im done with those its just the bls and first aid i gotta do
sue nursing academic weapon
procrastination my beloathed
first aid/bls
and then the acemapp ones
oops
ur ventricle go er er
wait no
its more
nyooooom
Bro i had no idea 😭
its ok
thats what anatomys for!
yay anatomy!!!
wait thanks for bringing this up, I did acemapp but not anything aha 💀
im okay
LMAOOO
check ur emails
fun fact! youre taller in the morning because as the day goes on the pressure from your weight and gravity compresses the cartilage between your bones!
whats haps?
honors anatomy and physiology
my favorite class ever
we had dissections every other week during second sem
ur mug will be a ok
asdfkjdw i love dissections
Thank goodness
ok about vent tachy
It is an funky action your heart can do not a posion
if its not in rhythm with ur aortas
pressure uppp
so it might make u more susceptible to shock
that too
wait why would it cause shock
maybe alexis is just ahead
ohhh
I thought shock was just low bp
but ig its more the cells I see
there r many causes
Tachycardia is why I drink 15 Redbulls before midterms
The heart beating helps me from dozing off and my vision going blurry
So it's a win win
uhhh anaphylatic, cardiovasular, ... the others
yolo ig
Yolo is the name of the county I live in
f it we ball vibes
This is a joke I do not consume caffeine at all
anaphylaxis --> severe allergic reaction
wait how is blurry vision a win in any way
its life threatening
i think
no u know what ur so right this is gonna be me in a few months
like
caffeine will save me
it shocks ur immune system so it releases too many chemicals
But like. With the vibe of it being a funny and quirky story
my max is less than 500 mg so depending on the timeframe you are just built different
caffeine is my melatonin
for me its 50/50
ill take a espresso shot and take a nap bro
its that alexis expresso
its cuz of adhd for me lol
huh
fun 50/50 fr
caffeine is a stimulant right
Introverts often have inverted responses to caffeine
it would make sense
nah same i drank like 2 of thoese panera lemonade chargers and afterwards i was like "i could go for a nap"
so then for adhd ppl it acts as a sleeping agent
Depending on the severity of the anaphylaxis sometimes a benadryl is fine
yea
Not all but some
oh wow
yeah 😔
nah but like
she drank 3
Yeah, generally considered not good
the caffinated ones yeah
at a point it was possible
More likely if you have a pre-existing heart condition
bc one has lik 380 mg of caffine and the fda recommend max caffine amount is 400 mg
I had no idea lemonade could be caffeinated
As the cleveland native for this server, nah hoodie and tennis shoes and your chillin
can u od on caffeine??
yes
you can od on anything
Considering the amount of times my life has flashed before my eyes slipping on slush, I politely disagree
oh yea
HELLO
On the 5 F days, hoodies are not cutting it
two hoodies :)
wowie
no if its a really good hoodie then your fine
You would probably experience complications from eating that many bananas before the potassium
you can literally od on water too right?
smth like
yes
but its drowning
if u drink too much water at some point u can drown urself
Well you're a native of Ohio (💀) so not all of us are as fortunate
theres also water poisoning
imagine not being from the midwest
midwest ftw
im from the west
😔
https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna16614865
Real
I know one person from the Midwest and he was my favorite teacher
Fake
midwest ftw
Adam can you confirm my anecdote
Hypotonic cells right
uhh
i think it has more to do w ph imbalance
ph of water is 7
best american region
and im pretty sure
most of ur body is acidic
Huh i learned this as a case study from bio 💀
it is also hypotonic cells but
yea
oh wait
ok i remember
ive watched untold stories of the er thats my medical background
acidosis and alkalosis
Welp mr. schilp messed up this one
#polls lets settle the best region
each has what the name suggests
oh did u know
I have high expectations 🤣
ur skin is acidic
:DDD yay acid skin!!!
if u drink too much water u do swell lol
Midwest easy
might burst oopsies
https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256#:~:text=When%20you%20drink%20too%20much,it%20can%20be%20life%2Dthreatening.
thats a fun show tho
valid
yep the spot where she put one of her thumbs got discolored after a while
oh thats cool
did it turn green?
prob
i think so
its brass
ik my sister has that reaction with jewelry
ok also
od is only for drugs
u can have too much of anything
unless water has fent mixed in it
Let me find my old iphone 7 real quick, youre gonna love this
guys
how common r frostbites up there
do i need to worry abt it
not common?????? unless youre like walking barefoot with a thin shirt and shorts in the snow????
be smart about what you wear and youll be fine
youâ€™d have to be out for like. 30 mins or something
No case is really something
I LOVE THE HUMAN BODY
please get a case
i beg
no case is crazy
Alex is going to Case though
whoa
why
he might be going to case but hes got no case 😔
I use one on my phone now dw i learned my lesson
surreal seeing this after months of anticipation
bro i had a friend who thought no case was fine once
woahg the case western reserve university
i have walked across campus with no gloves in the middle of winter while having a raynaud's flare and i was fine
oh good ok
Although im not sure if my sweat can dissolve steel or if its just aluminum
closest i have gotten is frostnip but i literally have room temp hands all the time so i am an outlier
ah????
Now Alex vs aluminum foil is a fight I'd love to see
D: actually insane behavior
what's frostnip
that scares me
The classic fentanyl in the water prank
like pre-frostbite
Followed by frostchomp
what tf did i just join into
thats not a prank thats a crime 😭
Garchomp variant

Um actually with a different name it would be a convergent form 🤓
oh hey ive gotten frostnip before
if you dont do anything to protect yourself yes
if you're dumb and don't use appropriate protection yeah
currently warm
You will probably find it cool (not cold but mildly cool) within a month
but i am an edge case because i have medical condition that makes my hands have little bloodflow a lot of the time
that's nice
LMAOO
:0
Thankfully
big temp shift
looking forward to it
spetembers gonna be nice and then you will experience the most bipolar weather youll ever experience
>2,000 feet ones do
mount diablo every year almost
where is the 12 ohio seasons chart?
I was just there and the weather was so nice though

A\*e\* where are we right now
we get typhoons here
Mods pin this as this is official

what is it now
summer
third winter....??? 😭😭
technically we are in hells front porch
Hell's?
transitioning into this yeah
Hellâ€™s front porch is coming soon
Just in time for Manual Labor Move In!!!
in colorado 🥰
mix between hells front porch and false fall
what have I signed myself up for
Potentially first week of classes
do I wanna know what sludge is
i think it got below 40F sometimes in april my freshman year
lots of fun :DDD
Its a cool substance
its just messy half melted snow
the sludge
Beautiful
isnt she wonderful?
I would call it slush
natureâ€™s icee
I use both
This looks like the intersection by Hell's facing towards campus and I cannot unsee it
i kept forgetting this
looks... fun.....
REAL
How good is case with salting sidewalks?
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ hey man I just looked up snow sludge and this was one of the pictures that popped up
is this why boots are necessary
pretty good in most places
it is!!! sludge and snow makes the best mix for making snowmen
i was in boots
theyre actually really good about it
this is not good.
im one clumsy mf
Sounds like youre a pro
ooooo
i'm not using microspikes on my way to class or smth but it was real winter boots
does knowing ice skating help
oh yeah EVERYONE HERE

# BUY WINTER BOOTS
slipping on black ice nearly gave me a heart attack one morning
omg black ice love her
winter boots and gloves will be your besties
I am learning so many new ice related vocabulary terms today
homemade ice rink on the drive way
how tf do u wake up
you just do
:(
18th?
what's a good winter boot, I currently don't have any
17th and 18th
how accurate is the forecast
get something fur lined that will keep your feet warm, also water proof and comforatable
you just chill with it after a few weeks if you keep a good schedule
I mean i like to say im good with predicting it but locals and news kinda doesnt matter in the midwest, it can just change
5 alarms set every night
oh i might do that
not the midnight one
well thats what orientations forf
whatever

real
for my 8am finals i had 12 set + had someone call me to make sure i was up
same I have calc 2 at 8:25 😭
i almost always wake up at the first one but i have trust issues with alarms not going off and needing backups
ah I see
i have two 8ams
i got blessed w my schedule this year
wheres psych usually?
sounds painful, gl 😭😭
psych 101
i might skip anatomy wednesdays lol
just wake up at 6:30 and beat everyone to the shower
oh shoot
have your old man tv (youtube)/breakfast
how r the showers like
im sherman
Just dont sleep, youll have time for everything
communal bathrooms for like
30 ppl
i think
so i wasnt crazy?? this is where my trust issues began lol
uh i had to manually disimpact my shower drain in clarke
sherman showers are chill
thats what flora told me to do
at least my floor was
do u have um
one time a girl dyed her hair and the stall was stained blue for a couple days
ah???
denker? yeah
https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/179330022/my-alarms-are-not-working-while-in-battery-saver-mode-why?hl=en&sjid=11279154964646813517-NC
also an android 12 update set alarm volume to 0
oh yeah

# HAVE SHOWER SHOES
yea denkers a character
just some flipflops you are willing to dedicate to the shower
403!
corner room
ayyy
nice
i was 418
is it bigger
???????
i think so?
showers r disgusting
ayy
like shoes to wear while showering?
Marginally
Yes
There's these flip flops with holes in the bottom that are pretty good
Mine are decorated war heroes
oh god okay
having trouble finding the article
yep just get any pair of flip flops that dry quick
I've probably killed hundreds of flies with them
just sandals or crocs or keens or whatever
i have a pair of slides i used for it
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2053520&page=1
is it this one
thats a crazy headline
nah it was more recent i think
but you can get athlete's foot and stuff from the shower floor
plus people jack off and/or have sex in the shower
D:
man
Luckily I think mine is safe from that
mine is all women's floor
yeah but one of your couches that you got from clarke at the end of spring break was fucked on
hopefully its cleaner
shower shoes also help you not slip :)
I'm talking about the DU house 😭
im gonna be wearing slippers in the dorms anyway
ah yeah
😭😭😭😭
oh you sweet summer child
Just like. In public?
what does that mean.
People are yucky
r freshies wild
is that what it is
semen shoes are now added to the shopping list under winter boots
semen shoes r insane
wait rewinding to shower shoes would crocs work or would they hold too much water? my old slides are lowkey absorbant at this point so i rlly need new shoes 💀
It's not just freshies lol. College is a "time to let loose" for a lot of people. Especially the formerly repressed nerds of case western reserve
They're fine just shake off the water when ur done
yeah someone came out the elevator and saw them
yeah crocs will be fine as long as theyre not like. sherpa lined
that is insane
😭
I will be entering the shower in these
big thing is hair
â€¦ they do what?!
do you not know this adam?
belatedly traumatized
â€¦ no because Iâ€™m not a degenerate
(Not saying you are ofc)
oh yeah now i remember the underwear email
huh
😭
Godspeed
what
WHAT
does this imply
public...?
haha don't worry guys you go to CWRU you won't be having sex

^^ i know a bunch were baseball boys
this is insane
and another table got totally smashed
wait r the laundry rooms the ones where its like
u can see on ur phone if its done or not
they kept having to have community meetings about it
like multiple times
Remind me
god I love living off campus
never staying in the commons thank you
don't forget the pooping bandit
THE POOPING BANDIT????????
ik theyd steal the ping pong/pool stuff from other common rooms and hide em
WHAT.
huge biohazard
oh also
what now 😭😭😭
im going tmr
They got an entire pool table up to Sherman 4 in the night
landing saturday
rockefeller and
hec
That was so fun to hear about from a friend
Oh god do you have the little quirky redeye SFO>CLE?
Ur orientation leader will do class tours
maybe sunday actually
HOWD U KNOW
It is a common NorCal experience
Not a nursing student (citation needed)
im hopping by chicago on the way back home
I have SMF>CLE tomorrow which actually lands at a good time
shoutouts to whoever shaved so much that both sinks in the suite were covered in beard hair
I vividly remember the moment when I transitioned from living in housing significantly less nice than think[box] to as nice as think[box]
wheres sears
smf?
case quad
uh
south campus
i remember
by bingham, veale etc
its the one with all the doors
back right from binary
it does have a lot of doors
is it the one that has
thinkbox
no
huh
think[box] is its own building
same donor different building
its connected right
It's messed up because they look like they should be double doors but they all actually open in the same direction
actually different guy
its connected to veale
ohh
that's crazy
not tinkham veale
veale
the one with the gym
then how about rockefeller
across the quad?
rockefeller is the old one
Danger doors
ah?
Everything on the quad is within a couple minutes of everything else on the quad
has steps up to it
you'll figure it out
yeah
do they have elevators
all my classes r 3??
yes
Same
you haven't lived until you've been on the roof of crawford
the old quad was such a mess. good riddance
the quad is new now?
they changed the paths in it, repaved, and redid the landscaping
they redid binary recently too
right?
oh cool
some of the buildings start on floor 3 from the entrance on the quad
sears 3 is ground floor
they "redo" binary all the time but I think they might have put more work into it yea
so is nord 3
nord 2 is the backrooms
most of the buildings on the right side of the quad have their quad level as level 3
is rockefeller 3 also ground floor
no
ill just go up the stairs
einstein lectured in rockefeller which is cool
oh wow
einstein also owns the cafe in nord
rockefeller was also in Cherry
it was before my time but tom holland was just chillin on campus
true!
caitlin clark was here in the spring
there is a telescope you can sign up to use on top of aw smith if tou get training
oh they film there right
i saw the rings of saturn through it
that's actually so cool, how do you sign up for that?
way taller than I would have expected
whattt thats so cool
reminds me of my friend at cinci who was in line next to a bengals player and had no idea why people kept trying to get pictures
nord 2 is the backrooms
oh buddy wait until you see glennan 6
😭
Case frat parties aren't even particularly good
understatement of the century

I've never been to a proper "frat party" that was good
basically nonexistent here
you get *thoroughly* fucked by the university and/or police if you haze people
From my understanding any hazing that does go on is relatively minor and usually harshly punished (if reported)
I know phi delt had a thing where people thought they were hazing people (they weren't) and the cops got called on them
I remember adam saying something like that a while ago
We had a like hour long course about hazing
That's what happens when you have June recruit people
A real sense of hospitality
only thing I can think of that might be even remotely considered hazing is "you have to memorize this stuff to be in the organization" which is true of pretty much every campus org
like legit had to go in there like "get out of the kitchen you are literally not allowed to help"
yeah
also don't try to skip the oweek trainings
I have heard there have been conversations around terminating greek life on campus
Ya I think the 2020 case is related to the "cwrusurvivors" Instagram page and the underlying implication of a lot of sexual assault cases that case was not sufficiently acting on
i personally have not heard of them recently
but wouldn't be surprised
yeah makes sense
Interesting
zoinks
i would encourage people to try a lot of things out
I very much agree with that
or maybe exactly where you expect
Also, you guys should join baja.
If I live in Juniper, do I use 11301 Juniper Rd and then specify â€œSmith Houseâ€ for the apartment/building section for package shipping?
Specific the address of smith as well as your room number
For example, "1616 East 115th Street Cleveland Ohio 44106 #205"
@roguish_raven so I should just add whatever my room number is?
yes, on line 2 of the address
Can confirm
I put it in Amazon as:
11301 JUNIPER RD # (your number)
CUTTER HOUSE
CLEVELAND,  44106-3977
omg iâ€™ve been so interested in joining baja, is it easy to manage it in freshman year?
ohhhh I'll update my address then
really depends on the person, but we're very understanding and generally are just happy to have people show up 😄
of course the more you put in, the more you get out
i was assuming itâ€™s kind of like frc with an insane time commitment if you wanna actually participate
Just for packages and stuff. For â€œyour addressâ€, keep 11301
is it like an application based process to get in?
got it, thanks for the tip
haha, any information on it helps
ooh thatâ€™s so cool
what's baja?
we build offroad racecars

what does the time commitment generally look like?
woah that's insanely cool
can anyone sign up?
yep!
i talked to some ppl who went to cornell and participated in baja/fsae and they all said itâ€™s like a super super rigorous tough environment and ends up like taking over your life
accurate for case?
ahh thatâ€™s cool
is it okay if I have no experience at all 😭
we're actually good friends with cornell baja, their structure is a bit different from ours. They actually get course credit for it whereas we are a student design team, so we're more laid back
i would spend 40 ish hours a week for my frc team in highschool 😔 way too obsessed
it would be unusual for you to have any actually
ooh thatâ€™s cool!
the FRC -> CWRU motorsports pipeline is very real
FRC6502 here
haha iâ€™m glad itâ€™s present 💪
ohh very cool, will keep it on my radar
iâ€™m team 4183!
i just did 11301 Juniper Rd, Smith House #403
😭
am i screwed?
nice looking robot
No youâ€™re totally fine. 99% of the time people deliver to the right place (Wade). Putting wades address just covers that 1%. Also smith is 11311 I think
thank you!!
Pinging so u see this
i just delivered it to cutter hall 💀
Itâ€™s the building next door youâ€™re totally fine and theyâ€™ll probably deliver it to Wade anyways
itll likely be fine


Nice!
How is it to finally be in college
😯
really exciting
campus area looks real nice
what dorm r u in?
cutter!
iâ€™m currently trying to figure out how to take a shower as efficiently as possible
yooo what room?
210
Shower?
shampoo your hair first before going to shower; put towel and clothes on door (away from water); enter with a shower caddy of products; rinse 1-2 minutes; return
showers also warm up relatively quick which is nice
yall i just did it i survived my first communal shower!!
tf u mean shampoo before going into shower
not that im one to talk about showers
oh wow I'm 214!
They added a whole $1500 😭
theives
@roguish_raven explain
Gotta make wise financial decisions
Gambling is legal so logically it's everywhere
Because most of the big ones do in Vegas
thats crazy
VEGS 104: Introduction to Gambling
No you have to be 21
So you get a pass this time
The medical plan is $1800 per *semester* right
Not per year
i made the grave mistake of not bringing a box fan for move in
is there anywhere that i can borrow one just for a night?
Accept a toasty night one
whatâ€™s that
keep the windows open at night
the breeze helps
Wait who are you flying with?
THERMOFISHER RELEASED THEIR LEGO LAB TODAY
NOW
Iâ€™m on a southwest flight out of Vegas with a few other people that have cwru merch on and Iâ€™m too socially awkward to actually say hi
Yo what
No way
Boarded 5 min ago
Tmrw morning
Yes per semester
I had to try and waive it
If my waiver is rejected Im gonna have to get a loan
Yes LMAO
Iâ€™m in the exit rows
Iâ€™m row 22 or smth
Iâ€™m wearing a pale Î˜Î§ shirt if you happen to see anyone wearing that, but I will be going dark for now because airplane mode
Same, Iâ€™m wearing a white hoodie with a pig on the back
Physics hoodie
Ok, that makes sense
I think it's usually on the door like "softball team from 5-6am" or something
If there's a particular reservation
But a lot of sports teams just have an expectation for a certain amount of conditioning and not necessarily the timing afaik
Yeah
Veale is nicer tbh, but the convenience of wyant is also nice
Lmao if you work out consistently for the whole semester at 7am I'll get you a Mitchell's scoop or something
That would be an impressive amount of dedication
> I'll get you a Mitchell's scoop or something
all gains undone instantly D:
My roommate and I are gonna hold each other accountable
But seriously you can hold me to that offer lol
Or a coffee or smth IDC
I think I will lol
heres the "facilities master schedule" in case that helps at all https://athletics.case.edu/sports/2023/6/14/cwru-facilities-schedule.aspx
Nah thatâ€™s awesome
I'm an afternoon or evening gym guy
makes way more sense for students most of the time but i dont like lifting while uncaffeinated 💀
Perfect
I don't drink much caffeine anyway
I just befriended the coach my freshman year so the football teamâ€™d kick everyone out but let me stay and finish my lifts
im almost certain that its healthier in many ways but it just feels nice lol
You can definitely still be there when sports teams are there too
10,000 iq
yes
i already have canvas courses populating
https://tenor.com/view/sad-cry-emoji-funny-emoji-why-gif-20325239
NO PLEASE
L
sci fi :)
:O
DAMN thats cool
and it counts for some uger 🫢
It's a little broad of a course to say that it gives a decent education in ethics
true!
unless youre an engineer
in which case a semester worth of project design counts as moral education and understanding global perspectives and learning about human diversity and commonality and also engaging with local and global communities
😭😭😭
What *are* the uger requirements
U need to take credits that fit 4 different perspectives but u can double count which is nice, u also need communication intensive courses and then gen Edâ€™s
- wellness (at least 1 semester movement, up to 1 sem no movement)
- communication (aiqs, 2 communication intensive courses, 1 disciplinary communication, capstone)
- 1 quantitative reasoning
- 1 of each perspective (moral and ethical reasoning, understanding global perspectives, human diversity and commonality, local and global engagement)
- general breadth (at least 6 credits in the two humanities/social sci/stem areas not in your major, an additional 6 credits from either of the two)
Iâ€™m just gonna take rlgn 101, it counts for pretty much everything
yeah it counts for the first 3 perspectives, which are all covered by a wide selection of courses from various departments at case
local and global engage is the problematic one
this is the complete list of courses that currently satisfy that one, from the main uger page
theres a secret second uger page somewhere that lists way more though?
and two of those are co op, and one of those is the HDC credit course btw
And once of them is listed twice because itâ€™s cross listed
I was told ORBH 310 is good
heres the longlist
There are only 7 actual classes
a lot of those are experiential ed/study abroad
yeah
which i think is the goal
I hope so otherwise I am fucked
learning about medieval european history counts for global/cultural diversity but learning about medieval european music and its history does not
its all a bit arbitrary
The only class that I would ever take is posc 357
💀
could your advisor wrangle that into counting?
Im sure they will add more stuff, or at least change things if people raise enough of a stink
because i did not write 3 long ass papers for it to not count as CI
so theres time for them to add more
😭
getting a coop is the easiest way tbh
thats just engi people though right
Maybe theyâ€™ll add more internships 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
and if youre not sure youre gonna do it at all that might be smth worth looking at
Those are still pretty expensive tbh
Yeah they are still a couple thousand I think
The requirements I need for graduation:
- 2 semesters of pe or health classes (no movement requirements)
- first sages seminar and two other sages seminars (equivalent of aiqs and communication intensive course)
- departmental seminar (equivalent of disciplinary communication course) 
- senior capstone project 
- 2 stem 
- 2 arts and humanities 
- 2 social studies and business 
- 1 quantitative reasoning class
- 1 global world and culture class
I'm not entirely sure
Tbh
Interesting
I think that if I took a semester abroad I would not graduate on time
So I will not be doing that
bc all the astro classes my junior and senior eyars are only offered one sem every other year
It def does
bulletin and stellic disagree
https://english.case.edu/spring-2024-course-descriptions/
Yeah same with my geology classes
me when im in a being internally inconsistent competition and my opponent is the case western reserve university (shine on forever 🫡)
wait how do u argue a class should fit a requirement (cause I think I have a case that my history of nature class meets local and global engagement)
Dean of students probably
gl
yea i was gonna ask my advisor if theres any way to get it to count
Co op used to be my main plan but I'm not even sure if I'm really gonna do that
😭
do it or a cs internship
Yeah Ik but I wasn't sure on internship or co op
also its good money, i got paid over 20 an hour this summer
I have to figure out if the extra money a co op gives is worth the delay in graduating
you don't have to pay an extra semester in tuition if that's your worry
That is true
@bobbylikebob I saw thee
I think I saw you lol
Finally back at Case campus!!!
Home sweet home
I love this weather
Alex agrees
Oh he definitely does
I also love wrather
My favorite
Itâ€™s like wrath, but more
Anyways
Gonna be there first thing on Sunday, canâ€™t wait
Why are the l key and the delete key so close together
Blame typewriters
Arizona will forever be my favorite state because so little humidity
California has less
Come here
Are you sure about that
Yes Micheal will come *here*
He has to get used to refering to ohio as here and not california again
Here, there, everywhere!
The red lighting is everywhere huh
The red lighting is omnipresent
I refer to both as here
â€¦ that is not my username
Is not the same
He did not pay for his pfp
Stealing property
I looked up red lightning when I made this account and chose the first image
Imagine
Fun fact, Disney world in Florida canâ€™t use Spiderman for anything, theyâ€™re only allowed to use him west of the Mississippi River

Yes please
Put them in my bed
Iâ€™ll be there tmrw

The scariest book there is easily Basic Algebra I
Those are fightin words
@jschlanket  light reading?
Just add â€œin physicsâ€ to the end of each title and Iâ€™ll be good
That one sounds tough
I found another one

See thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about
Perfection
(Might need to steal that one btw)
Category theory has already been claimed
Basic Algebra I might not be loanable but Iâ€™ll check
Might want one of the analysis books depending on how nice it is
Yeah fs
Alright thatâ€™s fine
Itâ€™s just that I will not give you all of them or anything like that
Two is fine, especially if not for the whole time
We have a ton more textbooks if people are interested. I will be helping cataloguing them over the next week
I think that algebraic geometry book is calling my name
You are all insane taking books that youâ€™re not taking classes on tbh
Itâ€™s fun though, seeing whatâ€™s ahead
YouTube?
Iâ€™m a picky learner lmao. I like in person, pen and paper and chalkboard
I mean that definitely helps me but i do still enjoy learning from a book from time to time
I find it super difficult to learn from videos or technology
(Screens)
Ok old man
Chalk is just awkward
Whiteboards better
More colors
My calc 2 prof actually had colored chalk which was cool
Whiteboards my beloved
But nails on chalkboard noise
I studied for ap bio with whiteboards so much
Do any professors use hagoromo / is it actually as good as people say it is
Yes it is
We have a box in the basement of the house and it is BUSSIN
Yeah
Is hagoromo that really fancy chalk that people love?
Yeah
No no itâ€™s the fewer words the scarier
My favorite CWRU cours title is â€œGeometry Iâ€
Introduction to Applied Abstract Algebra: chill!
Rings III: **run**.
It was fun
That's when I wrote my 25 page paper on polyhedra
If it would be fun that's all you need
Yeah true
Id take it with you
Iâ€™m down
We can both enjoy/suffer together
I suffered way more in complex analysis
Complex analysis sounds more fun though
My entire last couple years is going to be Quantum mechanics, aka applied complex analysis
Also tbh complex analysis is just conceptually challenging
It's like learning an entirely new type of mathematical intuition
Iâ€™m bringing a complex analysis book that I â€œborrowedâ€ from a teacher in hs
Itâ€™s more applied PDEs and linear algebra
Electrical engineering is applied complex analysis
I love â€œborrowingâ€ things from my hs teachers
Couple books, expo markers, calculator, whiteboard
But yeah I thought geometry was interesting and fun, but I'm also interested in the topic
Actually wait no the expo markers are from cleveland state whoopsies
Oh I was given (actually given) a quantum mechanics book from 1962, itâ€™s pretty cool
Yeah im on the fence about it tbh
I saw â€œtheorem: probability of this is 1, if a is much larger than bâ€
And lo and behold, the proof used 4 approximations

Idk I think itâ€™s super cool
I have a problem with this
What is this â€œ4â€ im not sure what it is its confusing me
I think itâ€™s just a weird way of restating the Gaussian distribution
See, physicists can actually count to 10 (not before approximating each preceding number)
How much do you agree with the following statement? g=10
Very much so
Because sometimes it just ends up being that when you round for sig figs even after using g = 9.81
Ï€^2 = g
Also true
Ï€ = e = sqrt(g)
Alex (Physics + CS 2028)
When finding g with a pendulum, assuming that the length of the pendulum is 1m and the period is 2 s, this comes out pretty magically
Thatâ€™s the best part tho
If i end up not hating physics i might minor in it just because its only 2 more classes but i doubt it
Wait what other classes is it
Classical mechanics and some lab?

Oh itâ€™s just random ones
Yep
I thought this at one point but I am not a talented enough physicist to have fun after modern 😭
I have a nice little W on my transcript next to classical mechanics
this is ONE scoop?!
ice cram 🤤
Woahg is this the famed Mitchell's that everyone talks about?
mitchell's scoops are huge lmao
def lives up to the hype imo
:000 my expectations are high
yep and can confirm it's amazing
Mmm Mitchell's ice cream
fr i was actually so shocked
They better be big for 5 bucks
peak
Itâ€™s so good
hey should i pay for the day one e books or nah
Website still says so but let me ask my friend who works at one
🥹
yo i thought i was seeing double XD
You mentioned this "friend" word which I keep hearing non-CS people saying
Interesting so you dont have any friends?
Define "friend"
Uhm
Next question
50/ 50?
Eugj
Iâ€™m going to western PA tomorrow, and then doing the trek to Cleveland Sunday morning
Michael is walking to Cleveland you heard it here first folks
Its not a far walk tbh
Pittsburgh -> Cleveland sounds like a fun hike
How much stuff are you bringing to Case, and will you be making the walk yourself
Checkmate
Shouldve started walking a couple days ago
I will not be walking tyvm
Too humid
Excuses excuses
The full trip
What is your beef with Youngstown?
I was just there the past two days so i can honestly answer any criticisms
YSU
Why does it have a building which is just a box
Okay valid
Their mascot is a penguin though, thatâ€™s pretty metal
Lets be real almost any mascot is better than ours
Letâ€™s list how many schools are the Spartans
Michigan State
SJSU
York College (right by me)
Dâ€™Youville
Do I will what
Do you not ville? Everybodyâ€™s doing it nowadays
i start my drive tomorrow
Why not walk?
lazy
Damn good luck
When do you get here Benjamin
I have a category theory book waiting for you
I start the drive tmr too but mines only 7 hr and 30 min
arrive sunday night
😔 tragic
I'm gonna spend it doing the bls modules
Thatâ€™s a good point but not sure mother would let me
SAME
(Not driving but getting it done)
Congrats on having free time cuz you moved your stuff in early
Allegedly
You already moved your stuff in?!
If a RA is asking no
WE BE GETTING THINGS DONE!!!!
FR
itâ€™s so interesting tho
That is the problem because I could get the module done so much faster but then I go down a rabbit hole of like what is the best way to perform this one technique
Ajdjandksnfjd anatomy my beloved
😢 that's so sweet of them
Yes we love raechel she is the goat
45 minute long car ride woo
Thats double mine
move-in day! just one (almost) day away!
anyone excited?
Yes
Want to meet people
Wbu
nerves are coming in
i'm a little excited but i am also a little nervous too
all of my friends r moving in and them being nervous makes me nervous
what houses you guys got? im in hitchcock for this year
Cutler (best dorm, not really itâ€™s just mine lol)
Can always visit
true
Iâ€™m 401
let me check what room i wouldve had

And it came like that
thats actually amazing
RIGHT
my original room was cutler 310
i wonder who took my spot

anybody chalked up or nah?
would make my day
Every time I go to the bathroom
thats
so funny
wtfff
You should
An creative genius fr
i wonder if ill find googly eyes in the hitchcock dorms
or anything cool in general
You could always add em 👁ï¸
Hopefully
true! i could..
Be the googly eye adder you wanna see in the world
Or however that one goes
what if i buy those like big ones but only put one on each one so that its like a cyclops or something
True
That would be amazing as well
it seems like i have a new mission
True
A new side quest appeared
yeah no absolutely
ill definitely lyk if i need the help, i appreciate it :)
Iâ€™m so stoked for o week
It **will** be great
aw that's nice
for cutter the RAs made these awesome decorations with albums we like
That is so cool what??
they asked us what our favorite album was
and put these Spotify looking decorations on the door with the album cover and our names
It sounds like it adds a real personal touch
it does 🥲
Also you can learn more  about people and discover new music
Who will be in CLE tmrw afternoon
Ich
already here
Why is one asking?
I will be in CLE tmrw afternoon and am curious
I will too
I have to do some volunteer check in at 5 but then would be down to do pretty much anything
So many possibilities
Yo volunteer check in!!!
Can we hold hands and skip to volunteer checkin
Depends how far it is from the house
Itâ€™s at leutner
Bet
Easily skippable
Anything is if you put your mind to it
Build up that calf strength
imo skipping is so much more fun and efficient than walking or even running
It's not as efficient because you waste energy propelling yourself upward
Humans are built to walk efficiently for tens of miles
But fun
Also mogs calf raises
Running is fun too tho
Gn everyone
Gn Jake
Safe travels
Human beings have evolved four (4) fairly special traits:
- Language
- Dexterity with the hands and arms
- Efficient movement over long distances
- Resistance to poison
JAKE I AM SO EXCITED WE'LL BE LIVING IN A HOUSE TOGETHER HOLY SHIT
Okay anyways good night \:-)
poison resistance?
sleep well
A lot of chemicals that get us high or we enjoy eating (caffeine, cocaine, capsaicin, allicin, etc.) evolved because they were highly noxious to other animals
Spite nature be inefficient
ah
ohh right, that makes a lot of sense now that you point it out
Ig also our ability to get rid of things from our go tract?
Keep going this is fun
Join us
try role playing as a Biochem major next - What do I sound like
Sam! Welcome
Take my hand adam we can be nursing majors together
We can **all** skip together
All the way to the HEC
"So all that stuff about human evolution is cool, BUT have you ever heard of ATP-synthase-ase-ase-2-ol-phenylalanine?"
:(((
But very useful skill set
This is hilariously accurate
He can join them in graduation year as well
REAL
what is synthase-ase-ase 💀
Accelerated bsn
An enzyme which destroys an enzyme which does stuff to ATP synthase
how many ases can you add before you just make a new name for it
🤓
Look I'm not the biochem major
The farthest I ever got was hs level light dependent and independent reactions
We are your ~~better~~ half
Humans evolved to run down prey
Humans can even WALK down lots of prey
New major I see?
The best
poli sci better
🚶â€â™‚ï¸🚶â€â™‚ï¸🚶â€â™‚ï¸
Us (nursing majors) skipping to hec together
is there any difference between those two
Yes because I am normally not a nerd
(citation needed)
Sure
*sure*
🤣🤣
Twitter has flagged this post for misinformation. Commenters have added context: â€œAdam is a massive nerdâ€
Thanks Elon Musk
You know
When people ask me if I'm a nerd, I still tell them that once upon a time in this little server called CWRU 2028, I said "I'm not really a nerd" and then saw "**Several people are typing ...**"
LMAOOO
Sure fire way to get the chat going
nerd adam was always there no?
Only Sophie is allowed to agree with this for now
*your majors, noooo*
NOOOO ADAM COME BACK TO NURSING
its literally in ur nickname thing
double majoring in the nerdiest majors on the planet
Nuh uh
Confirmed with sharing majors with @jschlanket l
lmfao
Nerd
SFO redeye moment
Good luck
Ooo good luck
have fun
At least there are no connections
Am I allowed?
Yes
imma just
just pop some bennys and go to beddy
where r u flying from if u donâ€™t mind my asking
its okay i can agree with it 6 times to make up for their silenced voices
sfo -- cle
U got this
hope the flight is smooth
i had an international one
hat man visit
thatâ€™s the only one iâ€™ve been on
from DC to amsterdam
too good
I am completely unable to sleep in cars and planes
i will say
I always sleep for just about 15 minutes
why did I think this stood for Ben and Jerry's
ok but for planes
as long as u sleep before take off
Would have been nice
at least for me
Alexis may I ask where the emojis for the houses came from
Iâ€™d like some Ben and Jerryâ€™s on my flight
but i also waited to go to bed until after dinner time cause i was excited about dinner time as i had never gotten a plane meal before
crest
Speaking of Ben and Jerry's @howitfeelstochew5gum0434 @wanningswontons I have not forgotten that I owe you two ice cream
but then i brute forced my day the next day and i was fine
👀
after take off im set tbh
ice cram 🤤
My sleep on planes depends how eepy I am
just to be clear the nap and sleep were separate
napped before dinner went to bed around 8pm maybe
woke up at 3am
juniper: writing/books, cedar: trees, mistletoe: castle, magnolia: globe thing (destinations), clarke: thanksgiving (?)
yea
Why be logical about it, itâ€™s just a big hammock
i use the military sleep method so i can sleep anywhere any time
Cutler?
cars and buses are so nice to sleep on tho (unless ur the one driving)
Sleep does not come for me
Sounds ominous
What is this
huh
Dude I swear I get some of the best sleep in the car
by community*
why you separate the cedar and the mag
car sleeping is great
You all who sleep in vehicles are insane
huh
same the gentle rocking does wonders
It makes the journey go quicker

i wake up right before i get home
itâ€™s not the best sleep ever but shitty sleep is better than no sleep
If the conditions are right I'm out in like 5 minutes
i just went off the website
lol
theyâ€™ve been merged for years
since at least before i was a freshman
bro
travel white noise?
me too it almost became a problem when I started driving 💀
perfect
its a fancy way of saying deep breathing lol
The chairs on second floor of strosacker are my napping spot and they are the best
i sleep quick and deep
juniper has definitely used the globe symbol. i have a juni crewneck with a globe on it
can go turning off alarms for an hour and not remember it
im the same way with light
Once Iâ€™m out Iâ€™m out
i can change it later
i am a deep sleeper by all means
Sprawled across your roommate's desk
but it usually takes me a while to sleep
I am not comfortable napping around campus but I do lay down and relax
i can turn off my alarms in my sleep
that is scarily relatable haha
He just like me fr
David would love that
imagine not living across the street 😎
LMAOOOO
How does one not know how to ride a bike
man you gotta learn
There are more bikes than people in my hometown so almost everyone rides a bike by 5 and most people master riding with no hands by 12
how
my friend hated bikes and then one day decided to learn and he has loved it ever since
Bikes are fucking expensive lol
not fun to bike in
Oh boy move in is tomorrow
Cannot wait
i biked in the netherlands (important experience) and that was good
Nobody here actually rides bikes anywhere, I just learned as a kid
Super car-centric
At age 11 I slowly trained myself to first coast no-handed and then pedal no-handed
Im gonna meet as many people as possible
itâ€™s fun tho tbh
as long as itâ€™s flat
at age 11 i was already running out of use cases for my bike
not fun if itâ€™s not flat
Hills can be a fun challenge tho
back at home there are public bikes that are free to use with stations at convenient locations so I love biking 🥲
not for my lungs
That is so cool
Who will you meet
Idek
limited handless practice
The only time Iâ€™ve really biked anywhere is at the beach
Face reveal and I might find you
No
Darn it
thats tru
Okay chat I might
We'll see
who i can lean on whenever
whos work 👀
Do it
Tbh it's the path of least resistance to date someone else at Case
Your four-year advisor
my vo2 max is like 28 i probably have some kind of issue with my lungs
can be dating or not
no

Nunya
Iâ€™ll sus you out
amogus?
Well yeah but that's like Sophie saying she could find me
Bill ciphers
sus like the popular game among us?
You have met me before
i can and i will
So we simply hunt down Alex then use him to find adam cool
Yo I've heard of amgnuso
Adam believe it or not but I think I could find you
I should probably set a policy of not dating people in engineering, compsci, premed, business, or nursing
amgnuso?
youll be at the concert choir open rehearsal right adam? or just glub still
The people have the right to know
Okay smartypants where am I right this second

wha
is this referring to a different server
No no I was just kidding
what in the world
JEALOUSY
Hard to tell over text I know

Itâ€™s that pre move in energy

what is happening here
TURNING SAINTS INTO THE SEA

why every popular band from las vegas have mormon roots
I think they are typing out a song and then there are about 3 other convos going on
He sings like 3 notes
CAUSE IM MR BRIGHTSIIIIDE
the chaos is kinda crazy
Itâ€™s a emo phase song, weâ€™re hard wired to like it
L take it make noise it ears that triggers release of serotonin
this server becomes increasingly crazy as move in approaches
Mormons that think Utah is too Mormon move to Las Vegas and then send their kids back to Utah for college
So does all music bozo
https://tenor.com/view/discord-discord-rules-have-fun-bruh-gif-17983909
Mr bright side is not an emo song
It's a white people song mainly
panic at the disco and the killers exist because of mormons
Heâ€™s wearing eyeliner
I'm so excited for this server to die
If y'all want a thematic emo song rn go listen to Ohio is for Lovers by hawthorne heights
It will decline after move in because all of this explosive energy will be redirected into talking to real life people, this is definitely the most active it will ever be
imagine dragons also right
Eyeliner does not an emo band make
Yeah
Maybe so, but itâ€™s a contributing factor
me still in baltimore staring at an empty server while everyone else has Real Life Interactions
same :(
Youâ€™ll be hear soon trust
Lol emo is a fairly specific genre that a lot of other random stuff gets folded into and I have strong feelings about it

booo tomato tomato
@eekhannah Name 5 things to do.
untrue
neighborhoods or specific things?
bc like
Things
😭
Beautiful sceneries, overall great people and atmosphere
i grew up in a small town
no good local restaurants even
well in comparison to a small town cleveland is great
Cleveland could be the shittiest city there is, it would still be exciting to me
cleveland is great
Case western is great vessel to transfer to another school
Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s good for
volunteering at the book bank, literally just walking around coventry, cat cafe in tremont, west side market, etc
okay why havenâ€™t you done that then
Tisn't a true metropolis
Funny I walked around little Italy and got called a racial slur. 😂
where did i mention little italy
It was implied by the tone of your voice
i like algebra tea house and thatâ€™s barely in little italy
'25
I'm sure, what was your top listened band in 7th grade?
Let me guess: Glass Animals + Eminem + Eiffel 65
My chemical romance
Real

Not entirely a good counterargument, as the question of whether or not cleveland or case is good is already a rhetorical argument and not a logical one
When did I say case wasnâ€™t a good school?
Anyway, some people dislike Case, and it obviously isn't a perfect school, but Case has been good to me and to many many other people, and I'm sure you freshmen in two days will have a good time
you said that case is only good for transferring somewhere else
like those are your own words
No I said case is good for transferring to another school
Never said there werenâ€™t any other good things and that was the only thing lmfao
Favorite album?
Ooooh um probably Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge
What you specifically said, especially the "that's what it's good for" after you called it a vessel for transfer implies that you see that as the primary purpose (or success) of the university. It's fine if you don't actually think that, but it came across that way from what you said
Good choice
nah nah corbos is better
I only go to Prestiâ€™s for the tiramisu
my residential house is empty as hell rn when will everyone move in
Saturday (today?) or Sunday
Aight
Sunday
Some tomorrow
Very cool people fr
Enjoy it while it lasts ig
the peace is nice
Yep
i was the first person to move into my 300 person building this semester
and the peace was nice
yesterday, my uber driver's wife's family owns corbos apparently
was a nice convo
So you derived your argument based on implication. Got it.
I think Sunday
u got to teach me how not to
Because you go into the real world with this type of immaturity, youâ€™ll have a splendid time. 😉
lol
So the first couple weeks or so I was fine because I was so busy with events and meeting people and what not - as the semester went on I did get a little homesick - keeping busy helps keep it at bay tho
nah
i was fine during summer camp
ill be fine today
if anything
im excited
yep I am excited as well hope the orientation is fun
Is the orientation actually good the people who have experienced it before
Like discover week
itâ€™s fun
that got better though
remember that you donâ€™t have to do all of the fun events (very much go to the small group meetings, youâ€™ll get flagged and checked on if you donâ€™t)
and also the small group is a great way to meet friends, it could be the place where you meet your best friend!
yep
Noted
go to events!! i met some of my best friends at collete through an english department welcome back event, and im not so much as an english minor--just go to stuff that seems even vaguely cool and youll meet poeple there. dont give up if you dont make friends in oweek
i know so many people that befriended people in their orientation group
iâ€™ve met so many good friends as an upperclassman
Join clubs too - I met a lot of my friends through hvz and joining core as well as joining glee club
I try to meet new people and make new friends every semester. Keeps life fun
Tom is the first event for me at case excited
my friends have changed so much in the past 3 years tbh
did u guys become good friends with ur neighbours
i met my best friend sophomore year
Like ur first year neighbours
my roommate became good friends with people on our floor, there were two neighboring doubles that became really close friends on my floor
so itâ€™s 50-50 letâ€™s see what happens
Yes
Norton 3rd floor was lit
727 no way
huh
To be fair at the time we all hung out quite a bit in the beginning. Tbh I was the one who found other friends
https://youtu.be/UYNpkDrCWtA
lol
but at cwru i feel like weâ€™re all pretty like minded
So itâ€™s not like you are intruding
so itâ€™s easy to relate to others
man I am all up for the American culture everything will be new to me letâ€™s see just how different the culture is from Asian/indian
Average case experience?
probably
i was just kinda bookish and to myself in HS
iâ€™ve forced myself out of social anxiety also
No anxiety just SWAG
also there are international student support resources that can help with the culture shock :)
I am ready for it bring it on
Come to uwc club
Most are international there
When/if that happens
UWC club whatâ€™s that
So United world colleges are this group of international boarding schools and a lot of graduates come to case
Ah thatâ€™s nice
And they are from all over
But other people are welcome
Yeah I lucked out
Ig they accidentally accepted me
a college like cwru selects for a certain group of people who are more likely to have things in common
ngl itâ€™s hard,,, but if youâ€™ve gotten in here you have the potential to manage it
lots of academic support resources also :) that youâ€™ll learn about in discover week
Um I would say difficult but ur perception of it will depend on how hard ur high school was cause for me they are about the same
yes
so grind time again
cwru is definitely harder than my high school but i hit the ceiling in  HS
Same it was crazy
On that lovely note I think I will hit the hay to be ready for tomorrow/today
Goodnight
thanks for the reminder i gotta be up by 6am
Gn and safe travels and gl with nursing modules
you and me both man
and then itâ€™s fine
hope so letâ€™s see
Any of u living in pierce house for first year
also profs will review essential topics
Everyone is in the same boat, don't worry about it too much :) unless you're trying to take like 300 level differentiable manifolds in first semester
Yep
Then you should worry
I honestly hope my starting classes are not too difficult
A lot of them require quite a bit of time commitment tho
Well maybe besides Orgo, but every class besides Orgo
I took IB hope these case classes are easier
I found high school very easy, so Case is harder. But my workflow is much better in college
agreed
and also itâ€™s more of an academic match
If you get a 5 in music theory I have the utmost respect for your intelligence.
i like a bit of a challenge
i'm talking about cim music theory
Also I've been decently ahead on certain class tracks so I was definitely taking harder classes than the typical freshman or sophomore
True!
Too far 😂
Thank god heâ€™s arrested tho. Lock him up and throw away the key
i think he's out now
suspended sentence
college is not impossible itâ€™s not meant to be
Crazy
there are classes that are going to be hard for you and easy for others
wait are you taking csds101?
yep
orgo is kinda fun itâ€™s all pattern recognition
do you have previous programming experience?
I have to start from CSDS 101
Aight I will talk is it better to start with 132
132 is the proper intro class that lets you take data structures the next semester
basically the way cs works right now is a lot of stuff elective wise is gated behind csds233 and csds302
Then 101 basically becomes unnecessary
kinda yeah, it's not even part of the degree plan
I think 101 is mostly meant for non majors who want to learn a little low stress CS
https://bulletin.case.edu/engineering/computer-data-sciences/computer-science-bs/#programrequirementstext
Itâ€™s fine
also for people new to cs in the major
with foreback?
Which semester
I am doing BS yeah
You are aware Matthew is a freshman right
im trippin i thought foreback data structures was spring 24 not spring 23
I'm loose
a lot of it is programming concepts
345
control flow and stuff
Then should be fine
people say it is a hard class but thats because it tries to pack a lot into one semester
but you should probably be fine esp if you have prior programming experience
its what most cs majors take as their first class
can you get credit for 132 if you took AP CS A?
yes if you scored a 4 or 5
Wait how different is AP from IB I have always wondered
okok
Different organizations run each one
IB is 5, 6 or 7
ib is harder and to an international standard
IB is more common Europe I think and AP is more common in America
also it goes further
I took IB chem too yoo
It sucked
yeah even mine I did IB diploma
Same
U international
Nah my hs was just weird
So you got a more fun class in the end
My hs did Ap e&m and mechanics in the same class
law studies was debatable
what
why
i mean thats how it works in college but aaa
normally they made some adjustments during Covid but itâ€™s back to normal now
Which the best class to take as like a breadth requirement for comp science major an easy one to score please
there's a lot but i would recommend finding something interesting
Iâ€™d say try to knock out some perspectives and take something u think sounds fun with a professor with good rmp
i and some other people i know can recommend intro to music listening
and history of rock and roll
Easy to score right
i just know they were fun
Is econs 101 fine
For breadth
There really isnâ€™t a right answer for breadth - do u think u will like the course and u find the subject matter interesting - then go ahead and take it
econ101 countes for your SS+M credits
Wow we are up late tonight server
Always check rmp tho - even if u ignore it itâ€™s good to have an idea of what ur getting ur self into
Are we
Not if ur a pacific time L
Whatâ€™s rmp
Rate my professor
... I'm in Cleveland right now
but imo a medium to slightly hard class you enjoy ends up being easier on you than an easy class that feels like a slog
â€¦..whoops
Ah are you from Singapore?
Go take a walk around
Familiarize yourself with Northside
Yep
bro
Ooof jet lag is a bitch
Hey DON'T call me that
Not nice
do not listen to adam
... why not
Night walks are nice
I am so confused
you already know campus and the area around it
LOL
The joke is that Adam thinks he's funny
On campus is fine
Singapore only good thing that itâ€™s very safe otherwise itâ€™s nah
Campus is safe but Walking around an area u are unfamiliar with in the pitch black isnâ€™t maybe the best idea
yeah this
200k for a driving license
that's very unfortunate
Yeah
Interesting perspective, thanks for sharing
$200,000???
that's insane
Singapore govt discourages buying cars like crazy
is it because the country area is so small?
i thought a german driver's license was expensive
I paid like 30 dollars for a US driver's license 😭
Plus compulsory military for 2 years right after high school for the citizens some of friends slogging 24 hours in military and suffering
Are you a Singapore citizen or just live there?
Not wasting two years of my time slogging
here you choose to do 4 years slogging and get free college
I ask them one question or help they will run away from u ten miles
god bless america 🦅🦅🦅🎇🎇🎇
Yeah
Trains forever
All will use high speed rail
good public transportation is awesome
shoutouts to cleveland for actually working on making their public transit better
I took the Shinkansen in Japan and was like yep this is the life
yes
God the only fanart I look at is maps of high speed rails all across the us
One thing about Singapore the only good thing itâ€™s very very very safe cause govt too strict itâ€™s a  one party state and people got no time to do crime lol they have to slog
I absolutely love the Tokyo metro system even if it can be incredibly confusing at times
front range rail is supposedly done being delayed and we will have hsr from ft collins to denver to co springs to pueblo
...
in 10 years
Hope USA would be a better environment than Singapore
mhm definitely, Google Maps is great now too at getting you on the right lines
I will never have the rtaâ€™s back bc  one of their busses just disappeared and I had to wait an hour at target
but i am relatively happy here
cleveland is a really exciting city
every year it gets noticibly better
\:-(
that's really nice to hear
For you Alan
most of the Americans I've met and got to know were incredibly nice which is really awesome 🥲
Yay!!! Midwest ftw
Do not go to NYC (cc @hicinserenomen)
problem is I'm so unused to small talk I blank out 🤣
Imma compost you
a waiter asked me how my day was going and I just went "um" and froze
But also yes new yorkers are assholes
just say good
I've learned 🤣
yeah
15-18%
oh yeah this is the only downside for me haha
Or fine - fine is the universal I donâ€™t want to talk signal (I think? Iâ€™m not good at peopleing)
But there is no service charge right in restaurants here
whatâ€™s a service charge?
Tip where people make a tipping wage which is generally servers at sit down restaurants
Like in Singapore in restaurants there is 9 percent tax and then 20 percent service charge added to the bill
Automatically
No there is no service charge in the us
yeah
Yeah
Bruh then no problem
My mom is so awesome
yes i 100% agree
caselets
caselets is a cute name 🤣
The larvae are coming
How much is pay here in Cleveland in restaurants
Part time is how much per hour
Anyone knows
okay that makes me feel a bit better haha
i try to tip because i am off meal plan but still get scholarship for room and board expenses and the ppl at hells have my order entered into the register and ready for me to pay before i even get to the counter
Minimum where I am from is 15 so no
In NY it's up to 16.30 per hour
yeah they brought it up
There is no minimum wage in Singapore some people slog for two bucks an hour lol
$2/hr is a crime 😭
Not in Singapore
wait 2 an hour in sgd?
Some places
whats that in USD
Tipped wage as a general rule is half of regular in Cleveland it is 5.25
the gdp per capita is high in Singapore only because of the rich but minimum wage laws need to be introduced in Asian countries man itâ€™s high time
1.5 dollars an hour holy
thatâ€™s only for brochure givers
Restaurant people get 5-6 bucks an hour
5-6 sgd
4.55 usd id lose my mind if i worked at a restaurant for that little pay
please tell me they get tips (they ask knowing full well they donâ€™t get tips)
Nah no tips
In Singapore
😮
How high is the cost of living
Very very high
theyâ€™re being paid 4.55 id be annoyed too
Sleep soon and enjoy your last day before the new life tomorrow
higher than most places in the us
see if u get a good job in Singapore itâ€™s fine u can live an amazing nice life which a lot of people do but u work in restaurants and other lower jobs ur screwed over
No and no. I will not ascend
â€œsleepâ€
Not you you numbskull, THE FRESHMEN
But one thing is that Singaporeans donâ€™t do these low level jobs they just force the immigrants and others to do it they too advanced
They think
oops
ahhh the dubai strat
ye
but I think as a tourist u guys would love Singapore
The more u stay the more u realise what the country actually is
Yeah but one thing Singapore has no homeless people basically 0
How...
Yeah thatâ€™s fair I bet thatâ€™s the case with most places
If u an immigrant and u sleep on the streets u get deported to ur home country if ur a Singaporean u get a small dorm room the govt pays
So they maintain 0 homeless
Ah so authoritarianism
How would they tell where Iâ€™m an immigrant from
If I have no ID or anything on me, what are they going to do
They roll a dice on the whiteboy table and send you to Albania
All immigrants have id
Have a safe flight!
U will be thrown to Malaysia
We honor and revere your sacrifice
See u boss
Iâ€™m actually prob going to sleep now gn guys
o7
gn
Famous NOT last words

Good night boys I will be watching YouTube gaming and sleep when u guys wake up

The pfp swap startled me

im fucked
I arrive in Cleveland

👀

ive landed 🧍🏻â€â™€ï¸
5amâ€¦
i would much rather have a delayed redeye next time
Yeouch
ill be flying on redbull tdy
It did give you wings âœˆï¸
Ikr
Me in my apartment
We suffer together 🫡
safe journeys yall
Waiting in line for the case id
Itâ€™s getting real
:000 epic man
D:
thanks haha
Iâ€™m sooo excited to move in
I wanna set up my apartment
Where are people on campus
itâ€™s only freshmen and some random ppl from summer and orientation leaders
We come on Wednesday
And Greek life
Ya that too
Wade
24 hours until I move in 🎉🎉🎉
They gave us our IDs in the garage
The schedule is on the app
It was so much walking and too many activities
Itâ€™s like 8am-9pm 😭😭😭
Itâ€™s a lot
I only did the required stuff
Also there are a lot of bees at case
They kept harassing me
Ya they need to chill it out
Iâ€™m allergic so I would prefer wasps
:0
I just hope for the best
D:
best not to test it
I am so Clevelandpilled
Iâ€™m even more excited for your 7 hour layer in Minneapolis
Iâ€™m 2 minutes out 😫😫
good luck
Yippee!
Well yeah but some places a bit west of me are next level
Did not know that was possible
Theyâ€™re the same as orientation leaders in my mind Iâ€™m ngl
LMFAO this is so real
the dude who posted the whole â€œwhat winning an olympic medal taught me about B2B salesâ€ or whatever made me laugh so hard
Do you mean the meetings with your orientation group
whatever this is
Seems like 1 mandatory meeting to me unless you love on floors 1 or 2
If memory serves you usually have two mandatory meetings, one with your entire building and one with your floor/hall
yeah I thought so initially but it's a bit confusing because none meeting are mentioned for other floors
Did this email come from your RA or some Clarke-wide person
it's my RA and it's addressed to my floor specifically
Wait I'm a dum dum, 1st [floor meeting] not [1st floor] meeting
Oof
Yeah I guess all of them are mandatory then \:-/
ohhhh now it makes sense
Assuming the building-wide meeting is equivalent to an entire residence community meeting, I think it lasted like 1 hour-ish but I could be mistaken
thanks! what about these "small group meetings"? what are they about, and how to get your group number anyway?
so true
I think we get our group number whenever we get our id
is it on the ID?
but I checked in yesterday with the international students
They might give them all out tomorrow
I'm not sure
okay I'll keep an eye out tomorrow
Nah we good now I'm out of Chicago now 💪
Beforehand on the Kennedy, there was a friggn police escort
Yoooo we passed it like 30 min ago
Woo lmao

true, im getting used to it pretty quick
everything was smooth sailing from then on
very cool

Nursing and med ya
I heard the nursing campus has all the good food
yes
oh cool, it looks really nice from the pics I've seen
u could come over
yeah I am going to eat only at the nursing building suggestion from all the tour guides and seniors I talked to
That will be extremely inconvenient
LMAOOO
is it far
Itâ€™s not on main campus lol
U have to take a bus
cuz the shuttle comes by like
every 15 min
I can bike there
its kinda far i think
Ya u have to wait for the shuttle and then drive 15 minutes and then eat and wait 15-30 minutes for another shuttle
Ya it is
I would not suggest eating there every day
you have a bike?
Cafe on the quad is good for breakfast and then thereâ€™s Tomlinson which has like a fake chipotle, sushi place, and subway
Where all the cs classes are
Buying one today
oh nice, where are you getting it?
I think Walmart has some
Iâ€™m saying the stuff I suggested is near ur clases
Classes

Tomlinson is yeah
Cafe on the quad is above ground and is next to that building
They have rly good coffee

So real

6 bags total :D
So have i
I got 2 boxes, a backpack, and my laundry basket fulled with bedding, and a suitcase
Ya I brought 6 ikea bags to case fresh yr
Woahg
It was a lot!
Ok I lied
did you bring a lot of personal stuff from home or was it like room supplies?
Both
I brought this much
oh wow
Ya it was way too much
I brought this much minus the right half of the picture
Thatâ€™s more reasonable
Ok 2 of the bags were my clothes
I have a lot of clothes
Because if not it will take like 10 minutes max
~~I brought so much more than that~~
Ur kidding
I also drove and consistently overpack
Letâ€™s goo moving in?
Well Iâ€™m adding 4 suitcases to all that stuff now idk how I can keep adding stuff
I brought my mom's minivan full of stuff and then my civic full mostly for the past 2ish years
I'm gonna have to get a uhaul to get out of this place
After the second month
that's sucky
literally me
My turn to drive the rest of the way
idk, it is probably polite to stay but you'll have to keep yourself entertained
GL

Uh should be
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
im not directly in cleveland so it could be that

Ohh okay hm
Jolly scholar open?
algebra tea house
but iâ€™m of the opinion that algebra is better
@roguish_raven what do you think
nah i think algebra's fine since its fairly close to the hotel we're staying at
yay
algebra is probably my favorite restaurant near campus
Lol falafel cafe and algebra teahouse sell distinct types of food so I wouldn't directly compare them
Pasta Fridays at algebra is one of the best things ever
algebra is one of the best things ever
plus itâ€™s a palestinian restaurant
heck yeah
anyone here read hieroglyphics?
Welp
Greek life having a meeting abt helping yâ€™all move in rn

I HAVE MADE IT TO CLEVELAND :D
Same
Got an airbnb in a questionable neighborhood
Ooo that's rough that's what I did during spring break for admitted students day and it wasn't fun
So excited to eat leutner food and then move people in for 4 hours
Approx. $1.94 an hour 😍
Oscar where are you in this massive room

Right corner on the couch
Jâ€™m wearing a headband

Skill issue methinks
welcome to cleveland
👍
just took my first shower here
Letâ€™s goo??
I hope you did not accidentally burn yourself like I did
Axel jumpscared me
Yes
WHAT
By accident
I did not understand how the temperature works
how sensitive are the showers
And I made it super hot by accident
like are they cold-burning in a millimeter of movement or
No I set it at what I thought was the coldest
It was the hottest
The temperature controls themselves are fine
jesus u good?
Yes luckily
oh god 😭😭
Will not do that again 👍
Smart
Culter does not
oh do the different houses have different tech and appliances? like i knew they would be different in some way but i thought that kinda stuff was mostly the same between all of them?
Fyi
wHAT
blue = hot would actually be really funny and also very tragic
anyone wanna grab a meal with me and my roomie?
at leutner
if it's open
yeah i had fun that first night trying to figure that out
yeah id imagine
On campus!
ayeeee welcome
the only thing keeping me sane
so trueeeeeee
Get a box fan and put it at ur window
mines does
Yes they all do
thank goodness
I should've got one 🥲🥲
Theyâ€™re pretty cheap at Walmart
if I do get one should I point it in or out
U can go next Saturday with the Walmart shuttle
Point it in
okay 👍
ohh nice
Ya thatâ€™s normal
🥲🥲
oh well
My room was so odd
which dorm was it?
Taft
No taplin
Then I moved to Taft
ohh
I had a first floor single
Itâ€™s the only freshman room with a private bathroom 😭
woahhhhh
taft supremacy
IS THAT AN AC?
what dorm/room are you in
Ya they replaced it with a better one
luckyyy
taft 402?
I have an AC accommodation
i forget the room number
oh okay I saw a very tall person and wondered if it was you 🤣
💀
nah i move in tmr
This was the final version of my room
The AC is in the corner
oh very nice
I kept that thing at 60 the whole time
i like this setup
why 🥲🥲
Itâ€™s the one in the pic
we get mini fridges now
wait
ya but only 1 per room
fixed it
The dorms are outfitted with mini fridges now
So u gotta share it
i may consider
my roomie thought I brought it
🤣🤣
I literally have no use for it
I have a kitchen so it has a full size fridge
lucky
i wonder
does anyone have a tierlist of all the first-year houses?
ive heard that juniper is the best
if you have roommates in the future it comes in handy
Cutter
Taft
Taplin
Smith
Clarke
Everything in mistletoe 
Everything in cedar mag
my current setup
clarke above mistletoe is crazyy
wall look so bland
where decorations
Clarke grew on me
When I visited it I liked it
â˜¹ï¸
the rooms are tiny
Ya but theyâ€™re cutesy
im cooked, im in cedar mag
Ur fine theyâ€™re all shit
oh word
what should I put on it
posters maybe
It looked so nice
wait are led strips allowed?
i feel like a clarke single is fine
YA
YES
but if i had to live in clarke with a roommateâ€¦
But ya I agree Clarke double is like the size of a normal single lol
if it's morning imma be there
i had a friend that had one on the second floor and it was cute
I don't have any cool or interesting posters
omg iâ€™m also morning shift
i may have extras
And now we wait
what's your community
I would love an anime poster
i do have a decently sized mob psycho one
they have not given me an assignment they assign the uce and sye RAs when we check in for our shifts
so i may be at maltz
ooo cool
🤞
MOB PSYCHO MENTION 🗣🗣🗣 ACTUAL PEAK ANIME
You have such excellent taste dude
i want a shirt of frieren making that one funny face
I'd have so much stuff but money.... :(
Me with Ganyu and jingliu acrylic stands
which one?
ive been meaning to get into anime tbh, anyone got good suggestions?
my hero academia is a good starter
i also find it mandatory to recommend attack on titan
like this
that would be good
blue lock (my absolute favorite rn)
i can check my anime list for more
but i also agree attack on titan, jujutsu kaisen and some other well known battle anime are great
alr thanks yall <3
ofc
depending on how much time you have, naruto is also a good first anime
dragon ball z ofc
😞
chainsaw man!!
~~yall better check out my clubâ€™s table at the activities fair next sunday~~
(What club is this)
JapanCase :))
the defacto anime club lol
yes
Iâ€™ll def join tho what time do you guys meet
ill drop our flyer in promos when i get home :D
itll have all the info
Sweet
Sweet ill fit right in
D:
Nooooo u should just come anyways
:(((
Come clarke
When is SAF
🔥
Not like it was a super high tech calculator anyway but still
what is japancase about?!
Monster
we watch anime together every week and talk about other japanese pop culture stuff (manga, tcg games, gaming in general, cosplay)
and i was on clarke for envision move in
So that I can buy it
Rascal Does Not Dream
I have an expensive calculator and itâ€™s actually so worth it
Be like me, have a 1990s TI-86
I have a TI nspire CAS
Damnnnn
i needed a calculator for 1 (one) class
Iâ€™ve needed it for every class lol
Justify it as a tax write off /j
You can justify it Iâ€™m ngl
Ya I assumed
Whatâ€™s 9 + 10
Uhhh uhh uhh
its like a textbook you use for multiple classes
I might have to actually look into itâ€¦.
And it still works
Definitely not
and this
Ya that too if u rly want a physical copy
Anyone staying at hilton rn
Good, I do not want to spend $200 smtg on a calc and chem book
wooo
some classes are required to list a textbook on the syllabus but don't use them
Only purchase Iâ€™ve had to make was ALEKS twice
chem 111 right?
Yup
use openstax
And whatever calc 3
Itâ€™s online open source
with who?
For calc 3
Aight
its so much funnier watching with japancase
i know what club im joining then
thats dope
would it be worth it to have physical textbooks if theyre paid off by disability resources?
probably zhao
personal preference
oh yeah leo who do you have for music theory?
crazy
How many of u pulling up to thwing center for the event
you're in the process of getting into one though right?
Yes
ok good music department can be a little slow sometimes
because the communication between cwru and cim is not the best
Theyâ€™re paid by disability resources?
Yeah, Iâ€™ve heard CIM admin is aâ€¦ mess rn
I think Iâ€™ll be assigned one on Thursday according to the orientation schedule
that's a bit of an understatement but yeah
our commentary adds a lot âœ¨
this reminds me you should look into the HPP ensembles
you get to borrow replicas of period instruments and play on them
Ooh
not quite CWRU's, but the illinois disability rehabilitation services give me a bit of extra aid due to financial aid + having hearing loss
Speaking of, which instrument (I play violin)
oooh
you can play vielle and viol and stuff
not viol im dumb
i sing
I play viola 🔥
flute
o7 I actually strictly speaking (cardinal sin) actually like viola equally on par with cello, and my favorite viola concerto is the bartok viola concerto
https://case.edu/artsci/music/ensembles/baroque-orchestra
Bruh
Underneath the overhang of Norton
Yeouch
Whatâ€™s the Illinois version called maybe I can find something
I might just have to make a run for the house
it can count as a primary ensemble if you ever decide to swap out normal orchestra for baroque orchestra or collegium
the normal orchestra is great though
@ actives and see if anyone can run a fetch quest with an umbrella. I would but Iâ€™m in pajamas and in a hotel
DRS (Disability Rehabilitation Services), I had to fill out a form and write an email to get started!
Thank u
:0
ofc!!
they are really happy to have undergraduate interest
I think Iâ€™ll do normal orchestra tho, I rly enjoy playing in a normal full orchestra (cue my favorite piece being Straussâ€™s The Eulenspiegel)
I will consider it, thank you v much tho!
sudden showers?
orchestra and choir did schicksalslied my freshman year
was an awesome experience to be a part of

It do be pouring
yikes
Itâ€™s nice if you are inside ngl
if you can get a good strong umbrella, the wind can get crazy here and destroy your umbrella
oh god
Same night (consensually) steal my roommates for international student fun night
Ya I have a vortex umbrella it works great
Any recommendations for umbrellas cuz I may amazon one to my dorm considering that fact? I brought one but I think it might be flimsy since itâ€™s meant for Japanese mist downpours and not bullets
Speaking of bullets
🌚
This one
Even when there were multiple hurricanes
Ooh nice
Thank you!
Also are you from Houston by the sounds of it?
Ya
tbh whenever it rains the wind goes crazy so you're better off with a rain poncho than an umbrella
Nah if u know how to angle it correctly the umbrella works
U just point it facing the wind
Iâ€™m from the Dallas area! Nice to meet you lol
Oh nice! Nice to meet u too
Crazy
crazy
\:-/
just the volunteers and staff
Welp
Will a hoodie and a windbreaker do the trick /j
Probably, yeah
I will likely be very easy to spot cuz I have 3 giant Texas all state patches on my windbreaker so
Drinking for
The first time today
Not alcohol drinking I mean literally
I woke up at 5 and this is my first time drinking anything today
Considering where I am
That's probably an option too
No I'm in
A questionable part of Cleveland
fun bullet fact: EMTs in new orleans wear helmets on new years because so many people shoot in the air
What a lovely intro to Ohio
Huh
God I love America 🇺🇸
lmao
I had an EMT shift on thanksgiving in Houston and I felt like I needed a helmet
AMERICA 
***EAGLE SCREEHES***
(I say as part of the minority here who are not American citizens)
imagine being in ohio right now

sent from iowa
Wait until we get a really windy day, then youâ€™ll have to watch out
yeah i have had to lean forwards into the wind to be able to stay standing and move around
I felt like I was gonna fly off the sidewalk some days
like 30 degree tilt forwards
is 5'5" tall enough to not get thrown to the side
it's not height it's weight
And then I get snow burn on my face
tru, i am forgetting my physics class lmao
Ya like Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€ and felt like I was gonna fly away
Itâ€™s weight based
welp, time to get that freshmen 15 speedrun in /j
i'm lucky to be used to dealing with high winds because of my time in new mexico
me and my friends would play outside in 70+ mph winds
Airfoil shaped kings be careful
i dealt with it at 60lbs so once you understand how it works you will be fine
ok canadian
I am simultaneously an american and not an american
dual citizen moment
dual citizenship is pretty nice
also out of curiosity, how did yall pack and bring your things to CWRU? did you have a lot of stuff and did it fit in one car or what was your move
i am forced to lose my dual citizenship when i turn 22 or smtg *(thanks japan)*
I flew and I put it in suitcases + ikea bags
u have to choose one
used southwest, and my parents carried one extra check in bag
I put all my stuff in a car initially but Iâ€™ve now flown back and forth once I got a lot of the bulkier stuff to Case
ty all
now i drive and yeah
what was the other one
South Africa
Yeah, dual citizenship with the US is wonky for a lot of places
Itâ€™s better for me bc if I get arrested America can come save me 🔥
Bc South Africa will throw me in a jail and let me rot forever so 😭😭
They do have better labor laws than America though
But like every country does basically
Thatâ€™s a pretty low bar lol
iâ€™m frozen
😭
dad is driving me so i have 3 suitcases and other boxes
word
is there a japancase server?
Yes
do you think you could dm it to me?

Sure
~~,â€™, | , â€˜_â€˜~~
does anyone have a picture of a hitchcock room?
:Sadge:
Based
peak setup
macbook and mouse

Do you live here lmao
Nah
Jeez
Guys why is it so humid here
Welcome to the midwest
What did I sign myself up for
All 4 seasons in the span of a week
average week in the midwest

Can apply to be a swim instructor
What do they say the requirements are? 
Are you a certified lifeguard/do you have a background in swimming?
cleveland weather is fine
Oh I'm definitely not going to apply but the reqs are experience in teaching swimming and preferably adults
They said if you're a licensed lifeguard you can tell them that too
swim instructor
accidentally got a margarita at Cilantro Tacqueria??
Alchohol taste like doodoo (Asian flush)
how do you accidentally get a margarita
Alcohol is F tier
alcohol is not very good
i only drink probably less than once a month and i am over the age of 21
drugs 👎
Alcohol + Gambling mortgages >>>>>
take it
Yep! I think a recent research study concluded that 99.7% of gamblers quit right before they win big.
Trust him, hes right
They rarely ID
I saw blue and was like
😎
can i install my own window ac?
or not allowed?
no
😭
yeah like what if i just installed it
who would notice?
I think you just do it
you would have to remove the screen
and it would be noticeable from the outside
also in theory you only need ac for a couple weeks, a box fan does just fine
the electricity bill
and the PFAs
Sleep soon and sleep well, class of â€˜28. Tomorrow begins a new chapter of your lives. Then comes excitement and new friends and so much to do in so little time.
But before all of that, have one last rest in the peaceful night before everything begins tomorrow.
(Have a fun move-in!!! I canâ€™t wait to meet all of you.)
o7
also shoutout to all the excited freshmen (and also non freshmen i suppose) here bc i had been lowkey anxious about going back after a shitty spring sem but iâ€™m feeling better now i think yall rubbed off on me
:)
:D
I'll be helping out with juniper tomorrow afternoon, hope to see some of you and be a friendly face :)
Otherwise, I'll be around if any freshmen (or non freshmen) have questions about things or just want to hang out
@reddishlightning can you wink when you see me tomorrow?
All I have to go off of is one picture
I will constantly scream tomorrow so
Excitement?
but the excitement too, sure
Oh lmao oooof
Hopefully your roommate finds it scintillating
Scintillating is a great word
i will go to some for sure! just seeing the schedule makes me overwhelmed lmao, morning to night of socialization is too much for me
Going to the residence hall, orientation group, and major/club things are probably good
yeah that's basically what I'm planning to do!
But free time is good for sure, especially because you want to leave time to hang out with people you have just met or simply relax and have some alone time
It's important to find a good balance of what will make you comfortable and what will help you grow as a person
Your orientation group will give a good overview, and Iâ€™m sure people here would show you whatever if you still need more
But after you move in tomorrow I would recommend exploring the North Residential Area a bit
idk where it's located exactly but I've been to one coffee shop at case like 20 times I swear
Oh yeah that one (I think)
No one will track time at all
a caring person is a bliss
It was more demanding than caring I seem to remember
was that friend of yours your roommate?
just asking
Like asking casually is good but I think it went a bit beyond that
Case might feel like a summer camp at first (it did for me)
i can relate 🤣
Not many summer camps have winter which is what snapped me out of it
okay true
how different is it from the rest of the US
Not that different really it's just that ohio is somewhat of a meme
oh I see
ohh hahaha
Hey man I might live in the US but that does not mean I know the us
once in class I was asked where I was going to college because we had an advisor come in to speak
I said Ohio and people started laughing 💀😭
Ohio lmao
TT
Ohio grew on me these past 3 years
Ohio loll
oh god 🤣🥲
it's cool!!
Downtown is mysterious
I passed by it on the way here and it looks exciting
Ohio city is cool
and I wanna check out the Asiatown haha
love the chandelier
there's a city called Ohio City?
what's that?
Very important to me that I'll be able to get my hands on good spices and seasonings
With all due respect you might be overestimating the amount of cooking youâ€™ll be doing as a freshman
Westside of Cleveland
the number of times I've been to Ukrainian stores is pathetically big
ohh cool
What kinds of stuff do they sell there
And also future planning
Like as a Californian I am well aware of what kinds of things one gets at Asian stores etc., but not Ukrainian
I'd assume
Well I mean like what do you get there
what dorm are you?
The only Ukrainian foods I can think of atm are borscht and salo
Smith you?
ooo right beside you, cuttee
cuter
Yippee
cutter
Adam wht does the text say in your pfp?
It's a watermark lmao I have no idea
if Smith has the same kitchenette as cutter it's pretty decent
Your pfp is watermarked...
That's gotta be the most adam thing
Bro I looked up "Red Lightning" on Google and chose the 1st image that worked
Wait a min isn't kvass alcoholic
So?
Ah okay
Gotta love my fake cereal beer
facts
Zach we can set up a distillery in the basement
I'm in too
W
Wdym by picked tomatoes
As opposed to normal tomatoes
we gotta bootleg moonshine
from the appalachias
pickled
oh god no
I got here yesterday
I don't even know what it is haha
I don't think it works that way
Sounds like an excuse
This makes the bacteria sound like animals
I mean it's basically what happens
They UV treat water
Alright Zach you have to choose
What are we building in the basement?
Mutates the bacteria

Tadaa
The horror of Chemical engineered water treatment

Bro distillery 100%
You are talking to a chemical engineer
But nuclear reactor 🥺
Okay actually freshmen y'all need to sleep
Big day tomorrow and it's 1 AM
No
I slept at 3 yesterday
and survived today
and I will do it again
I've decided and I have all the power
Welcome to our relationship
What if it's a uranium enricher or whatever tf they're called
Chemical
are there activities from day one Tom for discover week
Chemical enricher?
Uranium enrichment?
Yeah
😭😭😭
Adam you're about to talk about creating galaxies here
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ARA%26A..51..457N/abstract
https://case.edu/orientation/programs-and-resources/discover-week
I got here from California so I better not hear any complaining
Adam we can compromise. We will create a galaxy in the basement
Thanks bro
Hey man I regularly sleep at 1 and wake up at 7-8 am
np
international bingo night was fun
What time do u Guys go for breakfast at the hall
when does it open tomorrow
7 am
whenever I wake up then haha
brunch
And I met u only after the event got over
Or if I'm just tripping
Complete luck lol

Or did you just not stop at all
But somewhere in the north residential community
I was underneath the overhang of Norton
Pacing back and forth between the front and the rear where the dining hall was
did u see me
... perhaps
I'm not sure though which is why I asked here
were you at the intl student party???
No way
I am not international and also not a freshman
some of the seniors were there
i think the OLs were sophomores? at least the ones I met were
Gn everyone
Yes, the kahoot was crazy (I am not international but was invited?)
Making the drive yâ€™all
See yâ€™all in cleveland <3
have a nice drive 🚗 😎
Iâ€™m about 30 minutes out
https://tenor.com/view/finding-nemo-today-todays-the-day-excited-gif-13929260
thank youu
I had to make my drive yesterday
No way was I gonna make a 10 hour drive and then jump immediately into orientation
howâ€™s move in going for everyone
Wet
me too
And have to walk 20 minutes to maltz for my student ID
Currently waiting to unload :D
I'm also wet from getting my id :(
Ye
iâ€™m at cedar mag
D:
If you are still there after I get done dropping off my paperwork and student ID stuff I will come say hi Hannah
But also everyone else
Iâ€™m gonna walk over to NRV soon
iâ€™m here until like noon i think

Guys I met Daniel and I can confirm he is just a sunset over a city irl
Where😳
Yesterday
Ah
Outside leutner u were there I think
This is very well controlled chaos
Also Iâ€™m seeing too many people that I recognize form instagram itâ€™s weird
It is strange
Word of advice if youâ€™re trying to drop off employment paperwork today is in Wolstein Hall and not sears
Now now thatâ€™s not very nice
Adam do u have my volunteering shirt
Daniel has it
Dan does not actually
Dan blames Zeke
Iâ€™ll ask Zeke
Howâ€™s move in everyone
There better not be a line out the performing arts center 😭
was just listening to thatt
iâ€™m wet and unhappy
bros committed
this is so weird
Is it safe to plug a power strip into the desk?
Just plug it into the wall
The outlet is over by the window, across the bed
Or I could have my desk by the windowâ€¦..
Yeah
which lot do we park in?
46 or 53? or will there be guides?
There should be signs and guides and stuff that tell you where to go for each dorm
i truly cannot wait to be in my bed
46
Itâ€™s too hot to be in bed
i have AC
average temp in a room w/o ac?
😭
Unfair
iâ€™ve earned my AC
One billion degree
Weâ€™re  paying enough money we should get ac lol
Bro
my housing costs about 2k more per semester in theory
i thought upperclassmen get to live bougee and rent apartments
thereâ€™s on campus housing for upperclassmen
ahh
free rent is better than paid rent i suppose
but upperclass housing is nice
Youâ€™re an RA?
yeah?
iâ€™ve said it here like 16 times
Was trying to say hi
iâ€™m chilling by the cedar mag drop off
Like by the road?
yes
im driving over
For what house
STJ
@eekhannah should I park in 46 and walk to maltz?
or is there a better alternative
😭
axel located me
i guess iâ€™ll go in blind lmao
iâ€™m literally just waving a flag
probobly go to maltz then park, its a far walk if i remember correctly
Holy based
love my free stj room
@reddishlightning whatâ€™s ur shift
We are all afternoon juniper
Same as Jake
maybe iâ€™ll come visit
but thatâ€™s a far from my home

Wya
cedar mag
Yeah we all are
30 minutes
where are you
In clarke
Imma come say hi after this load
Im 25 minutes out wooo
Well
Fr
bro aint no way im carrying all my stuff 1/2 a mile from the top of lot 46 😭
Boutta carry all my boxes

12:40
They told me ppl r gonna unload it for me
I have way too much stuff for that
nah ur fine
Im hereeee
Lot 46 lets get it
💀
they have carts and multiplenpeople
and elevators depending where you move in to
Yeah where do the carts come in
im going towards my dorm house
I hear a lot of cheering outside lot 46
This is so exciting yâ€™allâ€™s
FR
Where do i go LOL
wyd rn axel
Jeez nvm i see it
So
My time was 12-1
But I actually got to the front at 1
Amazing
would it be better to unload from lot 46 to move in or just to try the move in line?
move in line
you do NOT want to move your stuff out from lot 46
lot 46 is just for visitor parking to tour the area
and all the other lots
Thank you i shall be getting this car out
To anyone whoâ€™s at maltz rn, they paused checkin for a few minutes
Reopened checkin yay
The custard is so good
Ah
anyone done moving in?
Yep
^ can help too
oh cool where are you
Cutler
:0 I'm also done
oh sure, that'll be great!
niceee
Oh okay letâ€™s gooo
Hello
hi
im done
im gonna start unpacking soon, i might come if i have the time
Letâ€™s goo (x2)
Yep, np
im also down for museum
Ehh prob wont make it but ill catch yall whenever u do another cool thing
No worries
If youâ€™re meeting in a big group for the first time you might want to consider not going somewhere that expects quiet
Just a consideration
Eh
â€¦
I think we could be mindful but that is a good point
If there's too many people we can always split up into smaller groups based on peoples interests
also make sure yall are back before your small group meeting
Yep
7pm
Go to the main entrance

where is taplin
These rooms are hot as hell
Weâ€™re walking in a big group
um
im by a penske truck
Weâ€™re right outside by where people unloaded for juniper
oki im behind yall
yall still walking
:thumbsup:
To get a vacuum
These vacuums r $200
Has she maybe considered a mini vacuum
From amazon
i thought there are vacuums you can borrow?
yeah same
but if you have to get one just get a mini one off amazon
When do ac turn on
â€¦ there is none
\:-)
open window + box fan
survive
Open window, all the fans set to max, and door open if you can
So like what do i do if my bed is against the window
Open window
Amazing
Do the non freshman dorms have ac
Or naw
upperclass does
some sophomore dorms do
How classist of them
mine was against the window and it was fine i kept it open anyway
me in my ac dorm rn
Also which one is better to you all fribley or leutner
two sides of the same coin
fribley >>>>>>>>> leutner
the grass is greener on the other side
the pastries are usually fresher at frib
and the pizza is better
theyre less likely than leutner to be serving meat slop in my experience
ultimately no meal plan is best
love not having one
I cannot afford such a thing
Well
Also my meal plan is paid for so
Free food over non free food
when you get to be an upperclassman and youâ€™re not required to be on the meal plan financial aid stops covering it
and so buying ur own food is way cheaper anyway
Its a 3 min walk to leutner vs a 25 min to fribley so
many people eat lunch at fribley bc its closer to where classes are
if i were a freshman with an unlimited meal plan again i would be using it at tommy
you just gotta plan it out in advance
not to go all â€œback in my dayâ€ at yall
guh

Also hec kitchen and brb cafe
Alr
@reddishlightning i would like to appreciate you again for helping me move in 💯
Yeah ofc
Is anyone doing anything right now
dinner at leutner
Nice setup Red
Somewhere in the process of
So that's not too fun
But I'll live
anyone in orientation group 30

Oh boy that's a line
Im happy i got there before the line, i saw it leaving
Whats the line for?
Leutner
Ahhhh
Ah
Lot of standing in this dining hall
thatâ€™s discover week for you
thank goodness

Line.
Only next weekend

OUI

If itâ€™s the Emilia Iâ€™m thinking of theyâ€™re awesome
Have Emilia B)
YAY
Yes submit a maintenance request and keep stuff off of your bed
She is very happy to hear the praise
I put mine as mid
And it literally
Is so low
Mid loft is where itâ€™s at tbh
@anton2839 welcome to the server, now you and @jschlanket and @michael_cjr can fight about the best major combo for all eternity
😭
Like does this look like mid loft
You could do this same thing for any pair of you
Closet
It is midloft
Yeah I might have to put mine as high
My closetâ€™s already full
Mostly bins and my suitcases
My mom's taking all that stuff back home
So
No such luck for me
Oh yeah how did the Taplin 3 PM meetup go for y'all
Pretty sure that was a planned thing for a few people in here not a cwru thing
Yeah I know but I know some people in this chat right now were in it
(That was the thing I planned)
It was good
Went to the art museum and then walked around the pond
Uh huh
Wait a min don't y'all have the residence hall presentations right now 🤨
Yes
They're playing a playlist called "upbeat mix"
I felt like I was being tortured
It was so loud and hot
Its loud but not hot
Honestly just might put my airpods in atp, like is this *really* that important
Unlike some arguably more important parts of the campus
It's crazy for all o-week because of scheduled meals and a bit of the first week of class but then it disperses wildly
It certainly sounds the coolest I will concede
these kids donâ€™t know what it was like to wait in the university mandated rapid test lines
yippee!!
(no one knows but the seniors)
Infinite space glitch in rooms is to buy a tower of drawers
I'll send a picture of my room setup later
I have like 4 rugs that I patchwork to cover my entire floor
It's great
Would recommend if you have an uncarpeted floor and a strict "shoes off in the room" policy
all of my drawers are full to the brim
Disinfectant wipes are good
B)
but lowkey they give us less storage space in stj
Lmao
My drawers are just a lil squeaky
But I think it was pretty new because they had recently updated the Cutler furniture to the new stuff
omg in one of the RA meetings they said that they can bunk some of the beds in clarke 💀
how's y'all's first day on campus?
My dorm
Is a 20 minute walk from strosacker
:rainpain:
Did they just say rock paper scissors tournament bro 😭
Nahhhh
So
Realizing in my infinite wisdom
🙂
Incoming third Walmart trip tomorrow because of course
Are these sessions actually gonna go till 10:00
Honestly have no idea
Sure seems like it
Is 9:30 so at least walking would take that much
itâ€™s just swipe category
If only they gave free bookbags instead of mugs
:waaah:
Why not just have your family mail it?
mailing stuff is expensive
So we can just buy another
Get a water resistant one
Or one that has a cover
How was everyoneâ€™s day today
No.
The entirety of Taplin fourth floor is going out for food right now
:0
Cant wait to see if this becomes everyday of oweek or just today
Thatâ€™s definitely O week
How do I log in to the wifi?
mostly o week
where is the food
Yes how do we log into the WiFi

LMAO
monday is the busiest day so get ur rest

Made a discovery with @cynical_socialist

pls
Hey is casewireless working for anyone
awesome, met lots of the '28 people here
ME WHEN I WAS ONE OF THEM
I'm 95% sure I passed by you but I didn't recognize you in time to say hi 😭😭
YES IT WAS AWESOME MEETING YOU
YESS
art museum was fun
fr
Frr
(Great minds think alike)
🤣🤣
what groups are you guys in?
11
dam
u guys start early right?
Im in 77
Not sure
what dorm are u in
Cutler
start soon
or now
how is it
Meh I'll talk to them if they talk to me
Hot
Very
We have 2 fans and the window open
Itâ€™s pretty fun
same here
Also the fridge was placed horribly
I had to plug it in my desk
im getting a fan tmr hopefully it does something
get as large of a fan as you reasonably can 😭
I got a small one and am regretting it
do we need two fans
twos a good number i would say
Like whatâ€™s the temperature
dear god
highs of 27 to 29
translate to american
uhhh
yeah 🤣
good enough
27-29 is nice
The cooler it gets itâ€™s going to be much harder
me neither tbh but we'll see 🤣
yep letâ€™s see
12 if we're lucky
Donâ€™t worry if things go well this year youâ€™ll experience multiple feet of snow and temperatures so cold youâ€™ll have to wear sunglasses otherwise the water in your eyes will freeze
I might regret saying anything
Bruh we are screwed first winter
You will
oh god
yep 🥲🥲
🤭 laughing with my a/c ~~in 11th floor clarke tower~~
does everyone have them in Clarke??
ELEVENTH FLOOR?????
Clark got 11 floors crazy
For me, the colder the better
At home I keep my room freezing
same here
NO sry to get your hopes up it's just me 😭 accommodations
PERFECT.
ah icic, you're lucky to have one 😭
YES :^) i am something of a fool but that is okay
it was pretty nice!! i got most of my unpacking etc done so that was good
definitely was hectic tho 😭 would have been stranded on the streets without google maps
how'd it go for you??
ah I see, was it hard getting things up to the 11th floor?
I moved in early because I'm international and it went great
it was pretty empty then
and I'm on the second floor so it was quick
tbh not rlly!! elevators did not break down as i feared which was a godsend â¤ï¸
oh awesome!! it must have been so chill during your move-in
ah nice
ooo also clarke? or a different dorm 👀
cutter
oooo nice!!! what's it like?
its hot as hell here yall i have two fans running
it's great, we got new furniture, laundry machines and fridges
and I somehow got a corner room so it's spacious
new furniture!! that's so good
fr really happy with the dorm
im gonna melt here
help
welcome to dorm life
We have to suffer otherwise no fun
The suffering builds bonds
True
I hope everyone enjoyed their first day :)
it was dope
Just hot ofc
I swapped it with my desk and Iâ€™m just gonna not use the desk outlets lmao

Yeah fr
clarke tower issues?
Nah Iâ€™m in Tyler
😞
She showered at 11
But I would check the blue/red connections first
I see
Yeah, I know Clarke tower had a somewhat archaic system to operate the shower, which is that wherever the handle points, the very opposite side is what the temperature is, and the fact you have to pull out on the handle
Lol I wouldn't really call it archaic . . . I think some of the hot/cold connections are just backwards
Also compe music is a helluva double major
I've met two cs/music majors I think, but never compe music
average walk to classes?
if you're on north side and in STEM probably about 15 min
Prob Iâ€™m guessing 15 to 20 minutes depending on where you go from? According to google maps
bought a longboard so hope itâ€™ll cut down time 😭
Yeah itâ€™s like that here too lol
Alternatively, golf cart /j
Lmao real
@bnkoeppen any advice to offer this fellow?
music is frontloaded, take advantage of that
Will do o7
So you will go to wade and pick up your package at the front desk, at the wade lockers, or at the Amazon lockers
so if i sent it to 11311 Juniper Rd, Smith and room # it all goes to wade?
affirmative
Case registered is primarily for devices like a Nintendo switch or Xbox I think
Case wireless is the regular network you'll be using most of the time
YOOO
Registered is for like TV, Gaming consoles, etc
THEY ACTUALLY ACCEPTED IT
Idk how cus ts does not follow their rules but I'll take it
Prob back door whateverâ€™s lmao
Big
Well, you can get medical care with insurance, just maybe not in Cleveland
We take those
Which I think constitutes as an emergency?
When do you guys use SafeRide?
like whatâ€™s acceptable tbh
also can someone send the Wade locker address? or is the one on google fine? 😭

up to you
Yeah you'll probably be fine, where are you from again?
South Carolina
I'll be cutting it close on most things but
My rule of thumb is that if at least two of these things are true, saferide is a good idea:
- It's past 9pm
- It's more than a 10 minute walk 
- It's below freezing 
If you're alone or it's past midnight, just take the safe ride
Long drive lol, but not impossible
Safe rides are only available after 6pm I think
Also they're not usually very fast in showing up, so try to order one at least 30-60 minutes before you think you'll need it
in theory you can probably get cheaper insurance coverage here
than the university plan
My mom works in healthcare and is considering switching to that Insurance but we'll have to see how that works
Cause I'd be covered out here if she does
But it's also expensive
who released a pack of yall on panera 💀
good reason to stay in my room today thank you ben
🤩🤩🤩
I swear I put the batteries in correct and everything
Oop
classic
🤩🤩🤩
it used to be really good
now its overpriced
@hismajestyofjackassery what's your major
How do you guys do the dark magic that is coding lmao
Welcome to Case \:-)
Humanities 🙄
It's like writing a poem or some such
humanities better
@hismajestyofjackassery what's your name
You'll have to earn that knowledge
mysterious type
Anyway are you in 132 or 233 this semmy
His names nathan cox
Wow bro just Nathan Doxxed him
You think you know a guy
Ful doxx
How long does it take to walk from the freshman dorms to Veale?
~15-20 min
Give yourself 25 to be there comfortably
👍
Give yourself 10 if you plan on running
This is very specific info Leoâ€¦
It sounds kinda like youâ€™ve ran there before
Give yourself 2 if you love being late
Nah Iâ€™m just a goblin and jester who likes to be weird
If you have a mig-15 you could prob travel that distance in like 10 seconds
if you walk fast you can get north side to mid quad (rock or stro) in 13 minutes but give yourself 20 minutes in case you feel like ambling or time the lights at adelbert and euclid badly
veale is a couple minutes from strosacker

my friends also said my room looks like a prison
And I'm also hoping to make a custom Eigenspace sign
if they still give you the cwru flags you can put that up for decor
Goodwill is a good place to find goofy decorations
clarke in particular is a prison cell yeah
fun fact: a clarke single has 32 more sqft than a prison cell
life in clarke
U can also get pride flags for free from the lgbtq center for free if u want those for decoration- they are small but cute
the church of the covenant has a thrift store on tuesdays and they sell cheap decor there
iâ€™ve gotten a couple cute things from there
things actively on my wall that i got from there for only a couple dollars each
Related to this, queer craft circle meets every week and I've made some cute decorations for my room there (and have had friends make some for me)
oh and you can make things at thinkbox and you only have to pay for the materials (not too expensive)
my bf made this for me at thinkbox
F
are u guys at the new student thing
im 4 rows from the middle
yo bobs so funny
Fr
He quoted from Party in the USA my year

Yeah lol what is happening up there
I may or may not have slept by accident during convocation but shhhhâ€¦
I almost overslept the convocation i had to bike there
Think beyond the possible
Bruhhh
This is like the peak of a stem major. All points into intelligence, negative points into practicality
Itâ€™s better than standing on the ledge
True lmao
Is it just me or is there a thunderstorm nearby
LOL
It is impossible to figure out for us freshmen cuz it is way too loud
If we get rained out weâ€™re cooked
~1700 people are about to get drenched
It rained during mine I think
Just a bit
how do you even get up there
Parking garage. Thereâ€™s an elevator
the line is infinite
Ohhh
The line is so long
***infinite hotel problem intensifies***
Luckily freshmen are countable

Dear lord
weâ€™re just looping around to the back of the line once they get to the bleachers
maybe were going in circles
Thereâ€™s like 1575 or smtg students right?
Yeah i think so
Wait

Crazy? I was crazy once

A rubber room
10 yards is about to start a riot
The OLs seem to be having fun
How do they have so much energy?
Theyre not first years
Thats good enough
Ikr any other time I'd be hyped but rn I just wanna nap
Same
I've had enough socializing in person today
SHINE ON
Practice and training
top tier communication
Should I yell yes next or?
The speakers help
Tell them to play Everyone K by Sha Ek and Lil Mabu
does amyone know what theyre saying
Wait so is there just another hour left
The best part is that I canâ€™t hear a word theyâ€™re saying
love the advice
im sure theyre saying great things i just cant hear
What
Is ahppening
whend they get the time to choreograph this
What is the song lmao
This speaker system is something else
We cannot figure it out in the bleachers lmaooo
Btw they said Leutner will be open until late night 2 am
For new students only
WHO IS YHST RUNNING
BRO JUST HOPPED THE FENCE WHAT THE HELL
WHAT IS GOING ON ;-;
I think it adds to the experience
I set up the sound. Trust me itâ€™s not the speakerâ€™s fault. Everyone is being loud in the bleachers so it mitigates the effect of the sound traveling clearly
i can sort of hear the music now
This is what I hear
The speakers are peaking pretty badly
Its having like moments of clarity
Thatâ€™s part of the song my boy
Itâ€™s not the speakers.
It may be different between the bleachers and the field audio
CWRU
Ah
Iâ€™ll be taking your picture
H no
In the announcers box
WE ARE GOING ON THE FIRLED?
Yea
Did anyone see the guy in the black suit

W?

Yeahh
I was the U

I wouldve had more fun if we did it in the morning
^^^
The important part of that is the OL dance
that was crazy
aw they did awesome
i loved the dance
yeah that was nice
impressively well choreographed for such a big group
iirc they start learning at the end of the previous spring
Everyone make sure to thank the Cwru police for keeping our campus safe!
im chowing on chips in my dorm
No
oh wait still oweek nvm
yeah
the den is overrated tbh
thats so real
the novelty of the den having breakfast food until 2am is cool at the start, just enjoy it while you can
yeah
I went to fribley today and it was so nice 🥲
bro they forced me to be on a meal plan for two years i do not want more leutner 😭
The best thing about leutner is that if you gaslight yourself into thinking it's good, it will still be dogshit.
at least it's closer to classes
I mean weâ€™ll have classes over there so itll always be closer atleast for lunch
mhm
when youâ€™re sophomores youâ€™ll get all the fribley you want
woo hoo
i could also go to fribley
😭😭😭
North side struggle fr
me when 26 minute walk
iâ€™m the most north i could be
but like. why would i eat leutner when i could have pierogi from my freezer
what's that?
pierogi is so good
basically ravioli but instead of cheese mashed potato
interesting
so yummy
it does look very good
i also have a ton of frozen meal prep from the summer
I'm just wolfing down this giant block of chocolate I got from trader Joe's
i have at least 15 meals that iâ€™ve made in my freezer rn
how giant is giant

MY GOD
thats awesome
i did that one time this summer
it isss
I've heard 🥲🥲🥲
very sar
youre gonna have one hell of a sugar crash
gonna be great to get me to sleep ig 🤣
that's so handy
I had a mega crash during the welcome and passed out during the speech
True story
any functions going on rn
oh god
where can you actually get good coffee here
i like coffee house
I drink coffee for the caffeine and not for the taste
oh cool! thats right across the street from me
itâ€™s cheaper than starbucks
If anybody wants coffee and in Clarke hmu, I have instant coffee and a kettle so
my roommate told me he had a caffeine addiction 💀
and one of the first things he bought here is a massive jug of espresso
Bruhhh
relapse incoming 💀
local is always better âœ¨âœ¨
Okay but better that simply go run
Make the most of sugar high
i will try it soon 👍
word
going from a small town to a city just has made me appreciate local restaurants a whole lot more
We may have a lot in common
any cross country runners here
My previous job poorly summarized was being paid to kick, punch, and throw children (I taught martial arts)
god i love indian food, is there any around campus?
thereâ€™s indian flame which is not that good. itâ€™s ok
BUT!!
The smell of spices there is intense
thereâ€™s gonna be choolaah in tink
probably for meal swipesss
ohhh I SAW
Also is it true some people call Tinkham ||twink||
is the vietnamese cafe in euclid good?
no
they should
itâ€™s tink
Huhhh whereâ€™d you hear that from??
erm
i call it tink
no idea man
oops
Connor or whoever, heâ€™s been calling it that ever since Iâ€™ve met him here
this is awfully phrased
I wonder where he got it from 🤔🤔
blame my autocorrect
or it could be wonderfully phrased
depending on your perspective
perhaps
as does everyone on this campus
however,,, the area between thwing and tink may in some scenarios be referred to as twink
i was just about to say that LMAO
facts
i was calling it thwing with the "th" sound like in south
itâ€™s pronounced twing
i have learned the embarassing way
i just use whatever the other person calls it
itâ€™s ok i also called it THwing
loot-ner
loit-ner
"newt"ner but n is l
lootner
yea
this one is the right one
loitner
🥲
Oi as in oil or?
yes
right?
like boy
lewt-ner
loit-ner
itâ€™s ok because everyone said THwing and lootner when they first got here
i love it when everyone showers at the same time during oweek and then the bathroom becomes a musty smelling sauna
too real 🥲
Pro tip: shower at 1 am /j
i actually might 💀
i love my private bathroom
or later at least
luckyyy
im not lucky im just old
Set an alarm for 12:30, snooze like 6 time, then go shower lmao
custodial cleans the countertops
Howâ€™s the retirement home? /j
its like engrained in me
ah nice
Bro please shower at least once in a 30 hour time period ;-;
my sink is outside of the bathroom
nah i always shower before bed
fun fact
I will have to today
so its just in the bedroom?
i am a morning shower kinda gal
no itâ€™s like an apartment
oh i see
i could not 😭
at home my whole family would like shower right as we got home

oh wait thats so nice
where is that??
STJ
whats that?
ah i see 💀
upperclass residence hall
ooo
itâ€™s the weirdly shaped brick building behind clarke
ah i see
a lot spacier than my prison cell
i was surprised they had sophomores there cause of how nice it was
it was about half sophomores when i was a sophomore but itâ€™s done to like 1/6
Quick question: if you took phys 122 by Glenn starkman how is it?
my single bedroom is probably around the size of a clarke double tbh. maybe even a little larger idrk
Niceee
ah wow
slay ig
Tho if I got a bigger space this is how Iâ€™d decorate lmao
im going insane just looking at this
I would do this, invite guests over, and make sure I sit on the floor too
😭

my room is kinda crowded tbh
i have a lot of stuff
wait is it o-week now?
yeah
this is my closet 💀
Yes
excitinggg
hi nobel howâ€™s columbia
Jeeeeez
Thatâ€™s so much clothes
im âœ¨just a girl âœ¨
currently drowning rn but decided to call the night, now I'm just relaxing before going to sleep
True
The only decor I have in question
Yessir o7
nicee
i think during the first week of classes or so theyâ€™ll be a poster sale around ksl oval

so cool
Itâ€™s the big boy one too
ooooo
they finally started selling them in taiwan
I knew someone at cwru knew about framework laptops
ah i see
*hisses at copilot in anger*
oh god
copilot is just
why
This reminds me of a shaving ad in Japan that said â€œour shaver has AI in itâ€ and Iâ€™m so confused like â€œ???â€
yeah.
its just a buzzword now
astigmatism
That moon do be looking nice 😏😏 /j /j

build the pho is nice too right
It is
is there any food on euclid that's open rn?
i got the munchies
im STARVING
Same
Iâ€™ll check it out eventually but my expectations of sushi is way too elevated cuz of my experience of eating like $4 sushi in Japan that was better than $10 sushi here
yeah fr
i see
Great sentence
Also insomnia cookie

Just cookie.
insomnia is mid
a single cookie to satiate my hunger
@dream.9446
Do you want a random ramen pack I have?
There's a good all you can eat sushi restaurant somewhere in Cleveland (kintaro) but it's a bit pricey
I have chicken tenders
Like an obscene amount
Do you have a cup of some kind lol?
i'll take 20
i got a free one at KSL
Bet?
I'm not a rascal house fan but I'm low-key a snob about pizza so it's honestly fine, eurowaffel is good but I'm pretty sure closed on Mondays
its okay tho but thanks for offering the ramen packet
did you go to the wyant one
eh
I have that too
Rahhh we go gym
Nah planet fitness

Unless youâ€™d like to munch on several cough drops lmao
💀
Lmao
I have a Costco size bag of cough drops too

why
nah it's fine lmak
Based?
This
You will get ur tendies
Asian parents + I use cough drops during the winter and dry conditions
I can not eat the amount he got
no it's seriously fine lmao
Anyway I gotta go finish a final exam. Good luck on your quest for late night food in Cleveland Nadim
i have some snacks here
Not humanly possible
ah okay
🫡
where is that?
o7
Its on euclid
mannn okay
Nearby the museum of contemporary art cleveland
👍
So no caffeine but all the cough drops?
Between ford and cornell
Ye
I see
Iâ€™m good, thank you for the offer tho lol
I will keep asking
Do they eventually serve cookies at the dining hall btw? Cuz if so I may just take like 4 napkins and just make a brick of cookies and chuck it into the dorm fridge so
Whatâ€™s the exp date?
They do serve cookies, but they serve cookies in the way they serve scrambled eggs
Hi alex #21
Fribs!!!
Thereâ€™s only 20 of us
I TOLD YOU AXEL
You said you had to meet 20
Brain no worky
There are 20
NOOO
Two important facts:
\- In the basement of Leutner there is a bbq place called Spartie-que. It is good. Go.
\- Their chocolate chip cookies are possibly the worst chocolate chip cookies I have had in my entire life. Do not get.
there's a bbq under leutner...? omg
Ooh
(I may or may not iut myself but as someone from Texas, I find bbq mid)
will do
I despise pulled pork but otherwise I think it's fine
I also outed myself earlier by calling buccees mid and overhyped lmao
Correct
Ayo you're the 2nd Texas-inhabiting Leo I know here
Sounds like I have competition /j
wait @reddishlightning you were on the parking garage and we still didnâ€™t meet
bruh
weâ€™re never gonna meet ever
LMFAO NOOOOOOOOOO
No way 😔
Iâ€™ll take you up on that offer if youâ€™re cool with it
I'm probably going to keep having sandwiches for the rest of the week
Iâ€™m Leoâ€™s roommate btw in case you donâ€™t know me hi
Hello
Yeah 😔 but you should go
It's a good way to meet people
If you walk to Fribley thereâ€™s no line but itâ€™s like a 15 min walk
An f-35 could do it in like 10 seconds
Cutler 401
So I just go and make myself a sandwich cus there's no line for that
😭
yeah the first week i would have like salads at leutner
Bro meet up with me tmw or smtg Iâ€™ll meet with you lol
Nice, I should be there in a few min
You'll see me up there too
i was like next to the delta chi people
i was on the right side
i only knew this bc they were all wearing delta chi shirts
Also my favorite thing that starts with a b is Nashville
(b)nashville
BNA is actually Nashville lol
wait really??
Yes lmao
Iâ€™m the guy in the gray hoodie btw @idkwutmyusernameis2931
Lgbt usually stands for lesbian gay bisexual and trans right?
Yuh
I propose the military contract version
LGBT also stands for
Lockheed Martin
General Dynamics
Boeing
Texas Instruments
(Sleep deprivation has made me weird lmao)
(Iâ€™m sorry btw lmao)
Yes please
Alright cool, I technically got the AP credit for it but I felt like I was guessing thru so much of the course in e&m that I feel better just redoing it so I was just asking
Iâ€™ve seen this meme
some sort of cookie (usually sugar or oatmeal raisin) is almost always there. leutner chocolate chip cookies are rare but really good
Lockheed does exclusively military contracts (think missiles), Boeing made the f-15 I think, general dynamics (or electrics) has worked on making the GAU-8 machine gun used on the warthog, and Texas Instruments made essentially hand held missile launchers
TLDR, turbo nerd stuff lmao
Huh and here I thought Texas instruments only did calculators
They currently do silicon chip manufacturing for communication equipment I think
General electrics also straight up make jet engines, and they also make your toasters or washing machines
Itâ€™s rly funny to look into random engineering companies
Raytheon I think started as a company making microwaves and now does missiles
For large companies yeah lmao
i love when companies do seemingly separate things. shoutout to michelin and the tire company to restaurant rating system pipeline
I love tje Michelin trivia fact
Fun fact: Nokia currently still exists, and instead of making indestructible phones does insane researching all across the globe
Bell Labs my beloved
Dennis Ritchie + Ken Thompson 🥰
No it's lase gestern beserve tuniversity
Based lmao

Real item in the LGBT center btw
BRUH LMAO
I do not support military contractors
I think they should do something else
Like train an army of pigeons
Pigeons are just government drones
Agreed
WAIT AN ALEX SPOTTED
Tick the count up
Iâ€™m the original
Wait Iâ€™m fucking slow lmao
Enlightened: birds were real, now repurposed to be hyper realistic drones
I think im free tomorrow before 12:50, anyone wanna play smash?
Alex and Alan we can try the tv in your dorm if one of you is also free
We can try the tv here tomorrow
great!
I'm thinking of training you guys to get a bit better at smash lol
hi guys
hi
um
Itâ€™s because all 406,000 freshmen are using it at once
Casewireless had a problem last night but yeah
Ive just been using caseguest
Also sign up for eduroam \:-)
Unsecure but its good
Or I could finally get a vpn
You can use this network at any college campus that has it (not just CWRU) from signing up here so I recommend doing it
Ah Michael you made the rookie mistake of assuming I can fall asleep easily
My body would just say â€œnuh uh!â€
Update
Heard a theory that itâ€™s from somebody mining crypto
lol
I bet at least one of you are in this photo
What is this
â€œDear worldâ€
When does breakfast end usually
10:30 and I just woke up
Normally there's breakfast till 11 but it's 10:30 during o-week
So go now lol
Bro it is just day 3
I mean I can be this busy but Iâ€™ll suffer a heart attack from the sheer amount of coffee reliance Iâ€™ll have so
Heart attacks are not good for you
Iâ€™m aware lmao
Yeah ngl I'm probably
Not gonna make it 💀
Iâ€™m finally awake lmao and walking
Interesting, Iâ€™ll def test that later /j
That's like, three bangs
Lunch starts at 11 so you'll at least get food lol
How did you guys survive o week lmao
Will it count against me if I drop a class right now and replace it
I'm not going to the
Make a friend in 4 mins thing
People on my floor wanna go to Mitchell's 💀
Go with them!
I think itâ€™s required to go but itâ€™s only through your group maybe?
I asked my leader n she said it was cool if I didnt

Also do any of you know a James Christopher mihos
If any of you have had him before
Which dept?
Astronomy
@cygnusxxii
I'm looking at prof November's syllabus for ASL and I
now i understand that one RMP rating
JEEZ
that is harsh
THERES A DRESS CODE FOR REMOTE
😭
like the background stuff makes sense but clothes?
He has to be tenured and old
I'll be honest o-week is kind of a blur 😭
im thinking of replacing asl with astronomy 101 its in the exact same timeslot so
Nah you can change around your classes with no consequences during add/drop, which goes till the second Friday of classes
ah okay good
I've heard that intro astronomy is very chill and fun
absolutely no way
I will take a moment to shill intro to geology as well
Fairly straightforward and easy (or so I've heard, I'm taking it this semester) and you get to learn about rocks
Sorry for dropping in randomly but that sounds like fun maybe Iâ€™ll take that next semester
I love rocks
It's a fall only course, just so you know
Join me :)
So it's at least within the realm of possibility
Ohh okay
Iâ€™ll manage lol, I like being busy with stuff
^
Asking about my dual degree
At least itâ€™s a little slower today
```No Valid Appointment Found And Open Enrollment Period Has Not Begun. The open enrollment period has not begun and no valid enrollment appointment was found. The enrollment request was not processed.```
My advice is to make a spreadsheet with your 4 year plan and just make extra plans if you're thinking about a potential double major
My spreadsheet has like 10 different 4 year plans
Gotcha thanks
Jokes on you Iâ€™m upstairs
Oh it starts tmw
ah

That's even better
nice
I've added a class in the second week of add drop before
you guys have your sylabi already?
i am not risking my grade like that
Some have sent it out yes
💀
oh lovely

oh yeah from what she said in her syllabus the hospitals would have been a problem

Am i screwed
The 53 1 reviews are a yikes
That's wild
are you taking 121
Everyone has to take physics lab run by Driscoll
also like
But the actual labs are led by graduate student TAs
She's fine, she's honestly nice. The lab handouts are just very long and tedious
123
And the lab reports can take a while to finish (but you have a week, so it's mostly fine)
You know what as long as itâ€™s not purposefully wrecking my ability to learn itâ€™s fine
Yeah same
Ill be okay
so yeah sounds like they meant this teach
It's just something that most people will have to do
I mean E&M stuff is confusing in general so
Oof yeah
she also has a dress code for if we go remote
you have to wear dark clothes
I actually found e&m easier than mech 😭 but I'm the anomaly
Thatâ€™s a quote and a half lmao
I think my test average was a solid 20 points higher in e&m vs mech
Jeez
Has anyone had michael martens
Good, I rly only am retaking it to just to make sure I have a thorough understanding so that my experience of my later engineering classes isnâ€™t just confusion
Thats the same thing im doing but just for physics in general
Tbh there are tons of resources for intro level classes
so far ive seen 2 anecdotes of the absence thing being very much enforced regardless of reasoning and honestly that's enough to make me consider dropping
gotcha
i try to go to class as much as possible but
the fact i can get my grade axed that badly over things predominantly out of my control
too risky
someone told me they talked to her and thereâ€™s very little she can do to change the way the labs are done
but sheâ€™s a very nice person
i actually took her as a lecturer for two semesters so
thats a little comforting to know
phew
yeah thereâ€™s no way around it really
itâ€™ll make ur life hell like once every two weeks
Yes she also lectures for 115 and 116, and she's expected to technically be in charge of every single intro physics lab
The lab handouts have been the same for a long time and they're not unreasonable, they're just kind of unpleasant
You only have to write like 3 full lab reports throughout the semester as well
The rest are partial reports or worksheets
worksheet days are heavenly
**when you have a full report
Long Tran sounds based ngl
should i be buying a specific notebook or report book for the lab reports?
Prof Tran is the calc 3 goat
But a carbon copy lab notebook for the labs
Okay
And then do the lab reports digitally
you will need a carbon copy notebook, but a professional fraternity or student org might do a sales thing around when classes start
tbh i have one that is mostly unused bc i #lostmyoldone
if you know how to use latex or want to learn, lab reports are a good way to start
#ineededitforonesingularlab
i always hated the reports when i took physics
You can also just buy a carbon copy notebook at the bookstore
like i could get to the answer but explaining how i got to that answer
Adam and Eric have been trying to get me to learn latex for 2 years
It's by the giant hand on Euclid
i might join them on their quest. It's just Nice
Ohhh
Gotcha okay
If you know where the hand is and where Mitchell's is, the bookstore is in between those
What even are carbon copy notebooks btw?
You write on one sheet and it automatically transfers to a second sheet
Ah
So you can turn in one of them at the lab
So I've heard
I prob should get one then for both physics and chemistry
Itâ€™s required for my major :/
Are you sure?
thatâ€™s not lab
no lab there
Chem 111 is general chemistry w no lab
OH WAIT
Chem 113 is the lab and it's listed separately
$200
You do have to take intro to gen chem
I may do a silly move and do gen chem lab in my last semester 😭
Youâ€™re right, itâ€™s just a discussion class
True, I just have a lot of requirements and it's going to be hard to fit it into my schedule
Welp
uhhh
It vanished
Sturtz has the most unhinged anecdotes
Wait where are the lost and founds
Bro is compe music idk if he'll have any free time
To take bonus classes
I meant to respond to this
I see
I do have to take 113
I'm just struggling to fit it into my scheduling
hi yes heâ€™s my advisor heâ€™s so cool
heâ€™s literally so nice
hell yeah
so glad to hear
No
U should
Just go and explore the quad
Bc we will there and we are cool (me and hayley)
Fribley is probably going to be pretty empty at the moment, most of the sophomores are not moved in yet
No half of us and scheduled to go there
Minus nursing students so maybe??
Im gonna go there after i finish this dear world stuff
Wait I lied accidentally
We have to go to leunter
Nursing orientation :DDDD
Why to leutner
Idek
How long do yall have before the nursing stuff happens
Clinicals in October
Ahhh
Stethoscope ceremony sept 10th ish
Uhhhh i hope this dear world stuff finishes soon so i can get over there before yall are abducted 😭😭
All good
Yall have fun then
(unless it's after 9:30 during the week or 10:30 on the weekends)
which of the iclickers is the best
Found my id in my name tag 🤦â€â™€ï¸🤦â€â™€ï¸🤦â€â™€ï¸
Big win
Usually itâ€™s in my wallet lol
@hellspells @idkwutmyusernameis2931
So many of these entry level campus jobs require cover letters
😞
welcome to the CS job market ig
Insane
That was what I keep running into when looking for high school internships 🤩🤩🤩
Proven experience as a software engineer bro they're interns 😭

Well that's nice
oh I see 💀
At least, I did not hear of it
it did
it was happening at the same time as SAF
G/a/t it
I just got here
Can u let me in? I'll be there in like a minute
Gosh new engineering guys we ready for another line?
Technically im not a resident but uhhh
Yeah sure
Yippee
I might go to the board game thing
me
also me
jackbox 8 specifically!!
for amazon packages
its the furthers one 😿
the tower oof
I'm not going to the
@viargentum ayo more mathematics!!!
Welcome to the server all new people
hi o/
MATH MAJOR LETS GO
There are more than I thought there would be
pure
i think
i believe so
why are there so many amth majors here
Yes
It does not but certainly no one is there at 3 AM
yeah wade closes at 10 😢
Oh wait can i just go pick up my package rn
i couldve sworn wade is 24/7
@reddishlightning i talked with the EE profs today and ngl they mightve convinced me to major in EE
yea
ive def been in there until 2 before
Yay math majors
but physics is cool too so maybe mathematics & phys? i'm not sure yet :-)
shiiii okay im gonna go pick up my package then, they sent me the email at like 9:40 and i was like no way
physics is a really cool subject
highly recommend
i'm taking 123 i'm quite excited
oh which session? we may see eachother
was talking to professor covault today and i'm ready to skip to the part where i get to listen to him talk for an hour lol
let me check; i just got the permission today
kk
@michael_cjr moment
the callout is crazy
@haroldasd 110
Do it itâ€™s awesome
1:10?
section 110
trying to send a package
nvm let me check
LISTEN
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE
just a regular shipped package (ie, not amazon)? if so as long as your name is on it and it goes to NRV you're good
yeah we have the same session :)
but seriously the way prof covault was talking got me so excited
thats understandable! theres a lot of cool things you can do with physics (and with a little bit of math in it too!)
phys 123 i think will be a fun class
A lot bit*
understatement is a great literary device
123 is cool but 124 is cooler
cant wait for 124
Wait whatâ€™s the context for this (old man here)
No u are great just do it
thanks adam! iâ€™ll try that
Suhani sited???
I lurk forever

just the "welcome to arts and sci mingle and ice cream" event, he was there talking to people about the major and classes
Me when Iâ€™ve met you ( the legend) irl
Lowky axel why did I not know you were a nursing major until now?
Nah axel we got beef now
What jackbox??
Oooooooooo
earlier
Axel you are the #1 discord celeb
Guys stoppp im so flattered
Grrr
I will grovel
Wade itself, the building, is open
All good
Just mannn
do you lie for fun
And then my energy runs out
I DO gotta
my favorite thing is that axel just found me, unlabeled on the side of the road and decided it was me
LOL?
that was after axel found me
WHAT
how
HAHA
I STAY WINNING
(Me and Hannah being prevented from meeting by some vast conspiracy)
yeah and what about it
you know my bf thatâ€™s enough
you basically know me (everyone is shocked to find out we are dating)
nah like i feel like if i met u hannah youd perform an autopsy then and there
Dont ask me why
Elaborate plz
autopsy???
yes
i will not elaborate further
Iâ€™d love to understand the logic
iâ€™m very terrifying
nah youre just very straightforward and im not used to that
the years have hardened me
:(
iâ€™m almost 22
DANG OKAY
I mean but thatâ€™s good in the long run?
old
Why is there no spine emoji to react with
also does anyone feel like walking to
insomnia
tbh iâ€™ve just been in several positions where iâ€™ve been told the rules and also been trained to answer questions
I could
which is why i was like âœ¨donâ€™t tell delivery drivers to come into the buildingâœ¨
DO IT
Good do you wanna meet where
It's kinda cool but also eh
you should
itâ€™s free!
taft? or i can walk up to cutler
Iâ€™ll go to Taft
cool
Depends like sure it's free but I'm not tryna watch baseball by myself and also
Walking
Eugh
theres RTA
iâ€™m also Not Great at regulating my tone over text AND verbally
fair! thank you for the clarification :) i completely understand that
it helps just to know
Ben and I are ON the way @dream.9446
Then become the way
Easy as
stay afraid
Update my sentences are losing punctuation I think this means itâ€™s bedtime
Iâ€™m not afraid
I just wanna meet u :(
punctuation in text 🤓
iâ€™ve seen you before so i bet youâ€™ve seen me
Sounds like something an afraid person would say
That would make sense
What does that mean, Muhsin?
oh my god
Iâ€™ll try to be out and around more tmrw
iâ€™ve seen u walking with sophie behind hillel if that helps
Error we do go
major spelling error
I am like Jake eepy
MAJOR
Remember how I was like â€œAlex in my head you look like such and suchâ€? I have literally no conception of what you look like
Red CS 28 is an abstract concept
💀💀
i imagine bro as their pfp
after meeting them I can confirm
Maybe Iâ€™ll meet some of yâ€™all tmrw but now itâ€™s Bedtime good night class of 2028 and also Hannah
Goodnight Jake
What about me you meanie
i need to meet you at some point
Oh and Charlie hi Charlie goodnight
Are u going to bed
So that's probably all I am
Good night Adam Iâ€™ll see u later probably
Someday we may meet
i should go to bed
Someday I might meet you Charlie
Wait red do you have the bed by the window or no
This is a lie.
Yes I do
I also used to have the window bed
I'm in the same dorm as Axel so
iâ€™ll stop by at some point
wait
Come now â€¼ï¸
were you at rascal house last night?
Not red
ahhh
courtesy hours say no
Wdym??
yeah but im loud as hell
💀
not really i just like meeting people
im very shy actually
hayley would probably vouch
Or me to you
or should I?
Would you mind?
If I see you I will sing happy birthday to you, be warned
oh boy
its fine i can walk over
Mb
if i wake up to people outside of hitchcock waiting to sing me happy birthday i will be very cross
@reddishlightning morning plan?
i know what im doing tmr
Fun trick for Leutner: get a group of a few people to start singing happy birthday so everyone in the building joins in, then shut up for the third verse so everyone says "HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR ... mibnulndbg ... HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!"
NO
I REGRET SAYING ANYTHING
ngl i have no idea where im going axel
No I mean this in general, not for you specifically
phew
Where ru
Rn we go to you
Ben who is coming says to wait by leutner
ok
i had a random thought on move in day and that was about people whose birthdays mightâ€™ve been on move in day
got a lot of thoughts when ur job is wave flag
How many people ended up coming to Mario Kart btw
It was just 5
Including me
Sounds like fun
It was really fun later
But we had a blast
That's fucking hilarious
Wanna do it ~~tomorrow~~
let's celebrate daz's birthday
Honestly sure
CS I understand because that's just how Case is in general
Oh wait are you not a Class of 2028 person
Alright
I think it's pretty good
@dborhegyi did but I think he's asleep rn
The village, STJ, off-campus apartments, etc
Nahhh
Uh huh
Closest I got is comp eng
Everyone is doing bio or premed
🎉
Wow
I literally was typing out a whole paragraph
Have you met anyone from this server yet?
About how rare we are
Yessir
Are you a premed or phy?
Wow
Thatâ€™s a first
Youâ€™re rare too
Is it not usually?
Writing code on paper 🗿🗿🗿
Thatâ€™s how I did my final
Pseudocode and Java
But 13 pages is crazy
From the way everyone talked about it I thought everyone I asked was gonna say Iâ€™m a cs major
Yupp
Yup
Thatâ€™s my prof
Which
I knew someone who called him Prof. Cronnembacher
I fear I may I have to see it to believe it
Thatâ€™s definitely gotta be an exaggeration
Crazy
Nahhh
Premed or nursing has to be more
True
Maybe itâ€™s just because Iâ€™ve talked to zero guys and all girls lol
Biggest major is biology
If you combine ba and bs then it is
Sir, there are children in this server
You can curse in small letters
Yâ€™all are wild itâ€™s not even that big of a difference
Start a TikTok page on how to get rich by buying crypto
No way you said that as an adult
yes
If you combine the biology department it's the biggest, but not bio as an individual major
i thought hannah said neuro is biggest
or maybe thatâ€™s just in artsci
Yeah
I have like so many ants in my room
theres a few ppl here in taplin
The biggest majors at case are cs and nursing, followed by bme, meche, and biology
But the difference in amount is not that much, right?
are you flying?
Can you do that as a sophomore?
thats the move then
Live in freshman dorms if youâ€™re not an RA
no
Clarke has sophomore housing, but that's about it
Nahhhh
The dorms are lowkey a vibe
Theyâ€™re cute if you decorate it
wait what
Sure
Yeah
6th??
boarding school kid?
The top floor or two of Clarke are sometimes sophomore housing
this year
woooo another one
I think it's in a weird spot
also this is random but are you ashton
i thought you transferred
ah got it
gl
that makes sense for triangle
Ashton how many discord accounts do you have at this point
Over under 20
50
why do you make so many
just out of curiosity
recently discovered they charge extra for vinaigrette
may already be fed up tbh
Bro you have some aggressive autocorrect going
walked all the way to fribley because ppl hyped it just for the food to be the same
its closer to you right?
ohh
i think ive seen it before then
are you on the meal plan
sup ashton
ik generally apartment style housing means no meal plan
triangle is far from the dining halls thatâ€™s rough
yerin too
also fully not done yet
some people in the new dorms have temporary housing assignments for the first couple days
nah
kusch
yea :(
not excited for the stairs
a year and two days ago for me
whatâ€™s envision again
ah
It is nice. Some apartments have dishwashers, some don't
I enjoyed living there
hayley alex and emma did me dirty
Wanna sing or nah
NO
Ur welcome :3
NO
what
biggest in artsci
technically bigger than biology but only bc they have BA and BS, if you combine the two biology is bigger
but those are technically two separate majors. and all three of these are biology department
no sophomores are in clarke this year
the only sophomores on northside are the 50 in STJ
There was a big push to get sophomores into the new dorms
ahahhaha
Which are not ready so thatâ€™ll be fun
nooo did they sing without me
Itâ€™s okay when I meet them Iâ€™m gonna sing so loud
Yes they did and i am pleased to announce that they did not get leutner to join in
this
we'll just have to sing it again later but louder
it was the only way they could be on northside
😨
personally i think sophomores have had it too good
okay that came off creepier than I intended HAHAHA
my childhood best friend at a state school was in a triple as a sophomore
Yeah true
Iâ€™m in a quint 🤩
i hope they do even if its like 20 sophomores
greek life booo
Its a guiding light of hope in dark times
stj was like half sophomore when i was a sophomore and now itâ€™s 1/6
🧐
so itâ€™s definitely going down
They moved everyone from noyes into temp housing for now I think
inch resting
probably tippit or staley
alr
i loved living in tippit tbh
its bottom of the hill, right near the quad, had a kitchen
Yooooo that sounds epic
Also what are the chances of being an ra for a sophomore dorm if I apply for ra
to quote someone on my team â€œputting sye on your preferences is dangerousâ€
but the issue with sophomore dorms is that they have the highest discrepancy in terms of quality
too much variation
also becoming an RA is a little competitive and it widely varies based on the number of spots available. thereâ€™s always a lot more applicants than spots
case will bend over backwards to not give refunds
$8 in my bank account it's so over
Swapped asl
whoâ€™s the prof
Mihos
Win
iâ€™ve heard mihos homeworks can be rough but thatâ€™s probably only for the upper level courses
iâ€™ve heard great things about horst and connamacher
can confirm pup is a good prof
I've heard that Parris is good
I personally really like southside for how close to the quad it is, even with the elephant stairs itâ€™s so much closer for the vast majority of my classes. Veale is also a much nicer gym and if you do stuff in thinkbox itâ€™s a big difference in distance as well
Bro when is music ever gonna let me register ;-;
Southside is nicer when you know where you're actually living and can pick to your preference (and live with friends)
@bnkoeppen
(Not a callout he would just know)
yeah thats the fun part idk
Bruhhhh ;-;
Also your pfp is funny lmao
How can I check my casecash balance?
https://cwru-sp.transactcampus.com/CaseOneCard/AccountSummary.aspx
I'm only seeing "bookstore bucks"
This is what I see
Huh

Interesting
So fairfax has this deal for $5 sushi on Wednesdays but
It is 30 min each way away
What are yâ€™all discovering today
I'm not getting ghosted
And we all have to be seperare places by 1pm
Now I'm running into another problem
I do not have formal clothes and I also cannot afford them
â€œCleavelandâ€ â€” the arts district
So we'll see how that goes
What are you discovering Jake
I might email her asking about clothing and how much it matters
This is not about casino night
Mb red
Not sure. Gonna make tacos tonight but otherwise just sorta chilling
No no the interview
I'm probably
Not even gonna go to casino night
💀
Heâ€™s a chef
FRR
Tragic
It is both a blessing and a curse
Casino night is gonna be great though
Thats tmrw night right
Yeah that should hopefully be fun. I remember it being really crowded lmao
We are free tonight actually
Sorta
Diversitey
Diversity?
True
I think so
We do hypothetically have a two hour period between our explore trips and the diversity thing
In that time
Which diversity thing and also why is ur keyboard Italian
Where lmk
Duolingo 🥲
Smith commons?

Excuse the light mode I promise discord is on dark
Ah nice. Only an hour is cool too
This does look lit
I can lol Iâ€™m just too lazy
Real
And I also have to scroll through all the keyboards I have on my phone
Yeah was gonna say thatâ€™s me with the Polish keyboard and English
Suhani is a polyglot?!???!
Thatâ€™s nerd core of u

Im only fluent in 2
I might have to RTA to Walmart or something 😭
Gl

😔😔😔
Iâ€™m barely fluent in English and itâ€™s my only spoken language
That's odd
CWRU guides says 7-9
2 languages is awesome
Also don't know if that's required
Itâ€™s def not a required event but as with all events, if you have the energy itâ€™ll likely be fun
THATS WHAT IM SAYING TOO MAN
Thanks guys 🤭🤭🤭

minor spelling error
Spelling English in Greek script?
the twenty thirst
Eta for english double E is crazy
Jake, thatâ€™s a disgusting thing to do. Why would you even suggest doing such a xenophobic thing?
Itâ€™s pronounced the same in modern Greek as well, and I also spell words like â€œpayâ€ as Ï€Î±Î¹ for the same reason
Oh if it's modern then that explains it lol
That was a typo and I meant ÎµÎ³Î³Î»Î¹Ï‚
alternate proposalã€use  a Japanese  keyboard to  type stuff
Greek likely has a digraph for ng
Yes itâ€™s this one
For the digraph
E.g. angel is Î¬Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¿Ï‚

Howâ€™s Wyant looking
Busy I assume
Veale will get a bit busier as upperclassmen come back throughout the rest of the week

Return to stick
On an unrelated note how does one get help to coat a sizable stick in resin in the thinkbox
Fr this is why I go to Tremont
But I wanna hit up Wyant w the boys
wherefore
But honestly just show up and ask
Want to meet the smasher?
Sounds legit
Gotcha I will introduce you too sometime
Not at all it just takes a spreadsheet and time

Very bonita
DAZDAY
This speaks to me on an emotional level
I'll be honest, I don't think I would enjoy trying to eat that
But I respect your enterprising spirit
Iâ€™m adding more next week
This is a bit now
Add one additional piece of spinach every day
By next month you'll be eating a salad
Oh no Iâ€™m doing just a whole extra tong grab worth every week
So today was one tong full?
2 tongs
With a bunch of mustard, and a little ham and cheese
Sounds like a fascinating sandwich
Food bits can be pretty funny
I'll never forget one of my HS friends taking like 20 bananas from the "lunch share table" in the cafeteria, eating 5, giving out 10, and taking the rest to class
A mix of respect and slight disgust
Perfect lmao
This is really funny I was part of smth similar
â€¦bannabbabna

BANANATOWER
So . . . Jenga?
Janana
Pretty much lol
Was the slight lean intentional or a natural consequence?
Natural consequence
My high school has some whimsical occurrences
Did orbeez become a fad in anyone else's high school?
Not while I was there
That's the way the world works
I remember carrying around orbeez in my pocket by themselves for a while
My brain thought of zorbeez and I was like why would that be a fad

Orbeez
https://youtu.be/jMWvTP_LPHY?si=xGpKMj_-k3ScgKYi
But no it was the little squishy ones
Yea those are neat
Yâ€™allâ€™s Iâ€™m deciding what shoes to get and this is the final deliberation

Red or yellow
Red imo, but I also donâ€™t particularly like yellow in most scenarios
Red
Red
why....
Did you not see this
This
agreed
commit to random bits for the funnies
jean banana
I believe in the philosophy of commit to the bit
Lmao dare I say iconic
would not recommend
Yeowch
This reminds me
yellow
red is so loud
What else are you gonna do with a bunch of bananas
*insert joke about being irradiated from potassium*

For a little bit of context people were required to take it along with the rest of the provided school lunch but lots of people would just throw them away so me and some friends would go around collecting them
And gave them all to a teacher after lmao
you helped them save on groceries
the hessler darty is not real
the what
dw about it
I am not
I spend far more time outside of my dorm than in it
The shoe
Only like 2 people in this discord have ever met me
I fear I did end up getting the red shoe btws
https://youtu.be/6ReeKVXmlHo?si=LI37w9vwifnnD5fU
@reddishlightning glad i finally got to meet you today
I think general consensus should be neither.
Same!
excited to start CS classes now
after hearing about 132 today im kinda glad i didnt use my ap cs a credit for it
since at my school that course was taught online and genuinely not rigorous at all 💀
i was glad i didnâ€™t get ap calc credit because uhhhh
i graduated in 2021 💀

I can help
i think youâ€™ll be okay
thank you 😭
i did fine in the course but it was depressing 💀
my sleep schedule so far has been way better than HS
Bro what, how did you live
Speaking of sleep schedules
Never done an all nighter, hope i keep it that way
its an experience
you feel fine until like 5:00 when the sun starts to rise
and then your circadian rhythm gets insanely messed up because you're sleep deprived but the sun is coming out
and then the next day you start dissociating from reality
oh god
That sounds lovely!
please no 😭
ive only done it like twice
iâ€™m only on call like once every 4 weeks
ohh
if i get warned for not waking up my first time ill pull all nighters
💀
they did not respond 💀
you gotta call the RA on call
i used the number they gave us
;-;
they are on call
what community are you in
juniper, specifically cutter
ohhh ic
@mudrocker who is your RA
sebastian
Last name
uhh
lemme see
on call is a rotation
garcia
did they call you back?
yes eventually
but after it was all over
yikes
might just be a one off
Probably a new RA on call 🤷🏾â€â™‚ï¸
i think the guy who got locked out just went to wade for a key
Oh wait what time was it
im not sure
Thatâ€™s prob why no one picked up the call
uhh like
12 pm?
midnight
O
Nvm
So
We have to text them lmao
I did like 2-3 all nighters over the course of last semester
Whatâ€™s it like 11 pm?
all of them were for hellish lab reports
thatâ€™s weird
idk maybe different communities are different
true
but we have to answer every call
Definitely not, if youâ€™re RA on call u should be answering
:oalmao:
in this case the person should have answered your call
Well also maybe they were backlogged cuz itâ€™s the first week for freshmen
itâ€™s possible that maybe they were on another call at the time
i gotta tell you something accept my friend request
ok
When they get a call.
O
If I'm asleep I might not get woken up by a call
Do you use one of those vibration alarm clock under your pillow? @redemptive101
Wow lucky mf 😭
you could probably get an accommodation like a bed shaker
My phone's like directly next to my head so if all else fails that alarm does go off directly by my face and that works more often than not
itâ€™s a smartphone
💀
that's wild
I wanna meet you in person sometime this semester
maybe itâ€™s cause youâ€™re not expecting it
like iâ€™m better at waking up to alarms if i know i have to be awake at a certain time
itâ€™s the mindset
iâ€™m not deaf but a very heavy sleeper
best of luck
dang
like just subconsciously turn it off?
as i have said before sometimes i wake up to stuff like this in my camera roll
bc ill accidentally take screenshots in the process
Woahg crazy
💀
My roommate blasted his speakers for Fajr so
Every single night.
so real
Enslavement
Yes
thereâ€™s a watch that makes you do like jumping jacks to turn off the alarm but itâ€™s so expensive
oh yeah it also shocks your wrist
to wake you up
called pavlok
Yeah Iâ€™d prefer not to go through Guantanamo Bay every morning. Thank you.
my alarm was going off for like 3 minutes straight max volume with me flailing around like a drunk
roommate did not wake up
i think naturally i slept a little lighter when i had a direct roommate
also because of the server
a closet???
lemme take a pic hold on
but me and his grandma bullied him out of that 💀

Looks cozy
why is it so yellow
lamp
ah
nice
its more orangeish in real life
ambient lighting W
i just got fairy lights in my room and i love
itâ€™s so great
no big light
my roommate and i have fucked up sleep so we need a light but the sterile white light is fucked up at 1am
also today i found out its quite easy to see into the 2nd floor dorm rooms from outside the buildig haha
try having a window that directly faces others windows in the same building 💀
oh god
Yes 😔
i am describing my own bedroom
😭
u can see my fairy lights teehee
oh yes they look nice
might have to get some
Ok so fr who is wilding out in the juniper outdoors
How do yâ€™allâ€™s have the energy to be wilding out at this fine hour
the joys of youth
Well now I sound old

Bro my driver's license is literally doxxing me this is so messed up
this was such a good movie
I enjoyed almost everything about everything everywhere all at once
prob my favorite
I did not like the hot dog fingers
That part bothered me
my favorite movie is interstellar but this one comes pretty close
omg Christopher Nolan fan?
YEAH
no wayyy samw
i love christopher nolan
but everything else
I think I've seen
memento is pretty good, i think some of his others are better
I think I watched inception 5 times
I've either enjoyed them or really loved them
Yeah no thats the awesome part, all of them are amazing
fr
thoughts on tenet?
i honestly was a little confused at first (as i am with some of his movies) but it turned out to be a really cool concept
a lot of his movies are like that
yeahhh
haha nice
ive met too many tenet haters 😔😔
glad you aren't one of them
i mean i can get why but i think thats just because of like
yeah
absolutely
if the speakers were any better in the dorm houses we could do a movie night
Maybe email aliases arenâ€™t a good idea
LOL
Interstellar is so good
In no particular order
you should have ur address if youâ€™re applying to jobs in ur home state (esp for california) or ohio (for dorm address) bc they may prioritize people who live there
i heard you were in a place and were told a thing
no?

Yeah that makes sense
Totally
Cos no OT and max 8 hr days is a rough restriction for me
chat what am i forgetting to pack
Umbrella?
true!
Charging cords?
i think iâ€™m good on charging cords. iâ€™ve got clorox wipes and the bathrooms have paper towels so i should be good there
Nail clippers
💀
Iâ€™m so good at this
The restrictions are just for on campus jobs
Assuming I get the job I'm going for
Anyone know what they have at casino night tonight?
Probably poker, blackjack, and "sports betting"
Anything to win?
sports betting woo
There's usually a raffle for prizes
i have a ton of extra ones tbh
off campus is a blind spot. you are capable of receiving OT
also i know plenty of people that worked ot at their summer internships
Ok ty
i got an interview for the costume assistant job
which i think is enough for me to hit my max of 1500 a semester
i doubt they're giving me OT if i get accepted
*if* i get accepted
once i hit the max im prob fired 😭
or atleast let off for the remainder of the sem
Come to Tacologist from now to 2 AM
Stay safe and responsible
reminder that there will be a meetup at mitchells tonight at 6

Is anybody selling an iclicker?
SYE camping event âœ¨âœ¨
If only you posted this like yesterday before I bought a replacement
...
You're the 2nd person
To recognize me from a2c
LOL
Some guy at the diversity seminar heard my name and immediately said he recognized it from a2c
wade at 1:30 pm
im goin to buy one from sm1
he has tons
For how much?

but ye those are the prices
Alright time to become active here
Man the iclicker resellers are going crazy this semester lol
Is 20 a scam
And whats the best version iclicker?
Does anyone remember what the bookstore price is?
I do wonder what the logistics of buying clickers in bulk and reselling them is
Bookstore is like 70 bucks
I had to get mine at the bookstore💀
WHAT
😭
If u wait there might be other people who undercut 20
But to me 20 is a steal
Itâ€™s really just the big core eng classes
So like the post above mentioned phys 122, the basic chem classes and maybe some others
Ah
Slay
Me in 5 years
Hey '28ers
How has y'all's O-week been so far?
Fun but exhausting
Had an interview for costume assistant job

Yeah, not too far off

Like itâ€™s perfectly cooking a chicken breast and then immediately afterwards getting a steak cooked to congratulations level
Also any music people at the jolly scholar tonight?
P chill and nice
The vibe is nice
Yeah about leutner make sure you enjoy the ice cream before the miserable weather happens (it's rly not that bad)
I just occasionally see msges like that
ah ours was very alive
Only one that gets used is the one for my floor
And that's cus we're all actually friends(ish)
common gih win
i barely knew who the others on my floor were
I think suites help
People get to know each other
i mean i was in a suite style dorm 💀
Ours r called quads I think?
Their loss
Like after this it's groups of 4 max
So the chances of me keeping up with most of these people is slim 💀
On the bright side the dorms only seen to get better from here
Are the bookstore bucks included in tuition?
no
i think theyâ€™re charged to sis
Putting non freshmen in doubles is low-key new I think
Yuck
@leowhygamma
before this triangle was double occupancy bedrooms
Please kindly ignore what is happening in memes rn lmao
i would like to announce that i finally met @reddishlightning tonight (and also @cawu)
Oh interesting, thanks for the fun fact
I met a guy with the same last name as me today. So that was fun
i met adam hutchings once, he stole my uvula and now i can never speak french again
he then asked me what my favorite phoneme was and the uvular trill was unselectable like when you lose a finger in trivia murder party
Lol
This is me saying that you upperclassmen are fucked seeing what the lowerclassmen are doing
Because it is incredibly dumb lmao

huh 😭
only in ohio
Yea! It was fun methinks
@eekhannah you were not lying about the rearranging furniture grindset in southside dorms
its nice here though :)
https://youtube.com/shorts/Bvotr49eZN8?si=gf-qZEnsr29TRSIX
Wait I'm curious, do the freshman dorms have their balconies unlocked this semester?
ah
was it something yall did or did we ruin it for every future class
All my RA said was theyâ€™re staying locked to keep people from going on the roof
do all the juniper dorms have balconies
yes
i think juniper is the main problem bc the second floor balconies are like. on the roof
i see
so nothing to worry abotu there
Y'all ready for classes to start?
Kinda
Not looking forward to my 8:25 MUTH 101 class tho lol

But I don't even have to worry about piracy cause my program alots up to $750 per student for textbooks

This is a limited offer
I liked warrior cats as a kid and now they think i was/am a furry

Undeniable proof
Bro why would you wear cat ears and whiskers 😭
C'mon Alex
Heâ€™s very receptive to joining you guys
Heâ€™s telling me right now
(Alex I do not think you are a furry)
Eigenspace to furry pipeline
💀
Alex in eigenspace when??
Oh true
But take the signs and move them to the new place!!
So la resistance lives on
Nah do yall actually need another furry
The ~~lab~~ furry space
We do not use being a furry or not as a requirement or a disqualification for being given a bid, no
Crazyy
Diversity quota
Does anyone have an iclicker theyâ€™re not using this semester that I can borrow?
Finally, something to counter the oppression faced by furries
😭😭😭
Charlie spotted
What movie is showing outside?

Does anyone have extra lined looseleaf (preferably with reinforced holes) that I can buy from?
i think he's new
does anyone have the google drive with the pdfs of the textbooks
wait thats a thing?
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D0lWG3YcERIdeKy1Zf-zgqFIAO5liA2G?usp=sharing
You are probably better off downloading textbooks from libgen or something though
also there are multiple folders going around and this is one of them
can you just download stuff regularly from libgen or do you have to torrent stuff?
You can download stuff regularly although there is a daily cap
Torrenting can be done as an extra step I think but itâ€™s safer
Ah ok Iâ€™ll just download it then thanks
Even if we have a VPN and stuff
Not the safest practice
what free laptop vpn do you guys use?
Thatâ€™s your decision to make
Proton vpn
f it we ball
is it okay to torrent pirated files on case wireless using a VPN 💀
Start at least 48 hours before
For a multi week project got it /j
I used the meal plan to get something at the den
So none of that for now 💀
Tbh if you want a drink at the den you can kind of just get one
^^
yeah i would literally go to the den to get diet dr pepper all the time freshman year
Yep.
we have to pay for aleks?!
yeah
man
😭
welcome to college
WHAT????????????????????????????/
glad to be here 🥲
yep for chem111
dropping out rn
No chem for Emma

Why not
CS major
required course
The
True
cant wait to suffer with emma and alex in chem
Enjoy
🥲
unlike you guys axel and i will be having a joyus time in anat and phys
another reason to switch to nursing
🙃
nuh uh
uh huh
nuh uh
uh huh
Same
will adam be our TA for that
or for one of the recitations
Depends on what recitation he gets
please god
i ask for one thing
ill be seeing hayley in anth 103 but other than that i know like nobody else who will be in my classes
🥲
we can have twink mental health night after first day
🤣
LOL
REAL
for you ill try to make the 30 minute gap to get to clark hall work
are yall excited for tmw
nah i was kidding
Lets gooo
i say unhinged and unfiltered things when i am tiried
yes and no
excited to start classes but
Potentially
from where
not excited to do work/wake up
eepy guy right here
from hec
you should be fine
i have clinicals right before
the other hannah forced me to go eat with her
right now? or earlier while we were at leutner?
i give myself 30 to get to class from lab
right after the RA meetings
ohh ok
so tomorrow it will be me and google maps
🙏
:3
there'll be some of us tabling on the quad to help you find classes
thatll be great 🥲
yippee
how late can we be for the first week lol
try not to be late
let's go with "try not to be"
twinning
okay figured
normally i would say walk your schedule
but itâ€™s a little late for that
Yeahhhh
Its ok i got this guys
where are your classes?
lemme see
if you send me ur schedule i can map it for you
also case mysteriously took away my NMSC scholarship and charged me an extra 1000 dollars 🥲
i have one by guilford but that class is a few hours before my others and everything else is on the quad so i should be okay
GUILFORD MENTIONED!!!!!!!
oh god
is that the pretty yellow house near tink
(my favorite building)
yeah
Yeah
i have one in mather house this semester
ooo i had something in there for oweek
mather house 💀
talk to them
how many people are in the lecture and what does the syllabus say about absences
and also yeah talk to them
that takes attendance

my schedule
check with the prof but thats generally the case
my tuition is paid rn and i think this is the first time ive started the semester with my tuition paid
you're on the quad for everything except the chem discussion. the only thing that might trip you up is that the classrooms in crawford are downstairs. When you walk in, take a left past the cafe and then turn right and you'll see stairs and can go down and thats where the classes are usually
okay ty i will save this for tomorrow
NRB can be a little tricky but if you enter on the side across from bolwell g27 will be on the floor you enter on
bed time! have a good night everyone and godspeed tmrw. hopefully @reddishlightning stays up until midnight 🥺 🤩
gnnn
is that the nursing building?
Broseph I am hitting the sack
ill post Fun Information in the morning then if nobody else gets to it
anyhow nighty night
Yes, in a way. but Not HEC
i think we went past it during one of the tours
it is the nursing research building in the sense that that is where nursing research takes place
yes
okok
itâ€™s behind it
ah okay
does the G in G27 stand for ground?
best way to approach it is from cornell tho tbh esp if youâ€™re coming from northside
yes
okok thanks
hereâ€™s how to get there from the quad
ohhh okok
tyy
hey are any upperclassman willing to give away or sell their old textbooks?
aaaaa
i so have a class in NRB on tuesdays at that time 🌚
oh fun 🤣
is the white building the one right next to olin
yes
okay phew
i know where to go for tmrw then
I have uhhh i have 15 to get from clark hall to kent hale smith
i think i could do that??
yeah totally
khs is along adelbert
yippeee
but also like
not
thats weird
true
RAAAAAA
Good luck yâ€™all! Iâ€™m so excited for classes tomorrow
Guys Iâ€™m imposter
But rather quite neutral about the matter
Same
I think Iâ€™ll get excited as I walk to the classes
it helps if you have, say, a dnd campaign to look forward to every semester
True gotta have our little fun silly activities and side quests as compensation
why would you do that instead of spending $1500???

Nord is the one on the quad yea
Dear god

It's in the basement of the Hillel
Basically walk to thwing along Euclid and then keep walking past the church of the covenant
Then you'll arrive at the Hillel, which is a white square ish building
Go down to the basement and that's where your class is
First day of chemistry: deadass flash banged lmao
Ok so
Just watched covault eat chalk
Physics prof
Nice
I expect nothing less lmao
corbin covault has the most protagonist name ive ever heard
he was in a YA book at one point in his career I just know it
yeah he does that every first class
yo so does anyone know where to find the free edition of "we the people 14th edition"
It's not in the drive and it's like 153$ 🤩
Mf turned around and said "hi"
Like an entire stick or just a piece
I mean chalk is just calcium bicarbonate or smtg right? So itâ€™s not like deadly Iâ€™m guessing?
yeah its literally tums
stick
covault is a character he is great
Youâ€™re in for a wild semester
i love covault he is a great teacher
hagoromo chalk has a cult following for a reason
Trueâ€¦
It is like the best chalk in the world too so
Wearing a gray shirt with cargo shorts rn
I am looking for a 4th year who boiled mountain dew and put a tea bag in it who was in Cultler and is currently a senior
The freshmen rly do be doing batshit stuff for shits and giggles
i just saw a video where the guy said "what are sharks most afraid of?" only to immediately get a walmart ad
oh boy i sure hope I'm in the correct lecture hall
Good luck soldier 🫡
ty 🫡

the chipotle on euclid takes case cash right?
in theory but no
â˜¹ï¸

My OLs said that they just refuse to fix the scanner to take casecash
im doomed
i have to spend my own money now
i have an 8:30 class then and a class later at 1
💀
oof
gl buddy
thanks
have not started my classes for the day
Same I got 5 classes
On tues and thurs
Might drop one bur letâ€™s see how it
Goes for a week
😞
wat
oh word when do u have today
Is the Millis Schmidt lecture hall the same as Schmidt auditorium
I see a Millis hall and a Schmidt auditorium so
Yeah
I'm done with my classes today besides glee club
Jesus
I expected it when it said auditorium but it's huge 😭
Scrotumsucker?
Schmidt
Yeah Millis schmidt lecture hall is usually hella full
Yep valid
Unless they changed it
Same 1 more

interesting grading scale
i would've expected projects to be worth something
intro to java
csds 132
also allows ai in moderation
@dborhegyi is this how it's always been?
which is nice
Pinging Daniel because he was a TA for 132 at one point (not sure if he still currently is)
he basically only says to use it to see if it will find errors
and even if it "finds" an error that doesnt actually exist if you know what you're doing you'll probably notice
:waaah:
Ah handwritten code
Lovely
I mean ai is p good at pattern recognition to an absurd level, but itâ€™s kinda middling at generating answers so thatâ€™s why
No, this is extremely different lol
Interesting
:yippe:
Soci 101
Dr. Anna RybiÅ„ska-Campbell
Ahhh gotcha
But he said it challenges a different part of our brain and that's why it's hand written
😭
I'm so excited for this class in 5 minutes
it's gonna be peak (non)fiction
Why is CampusGroups so ass
Same
Insane
13 pages of code would send me into shock
So
For an accomodation
This AC is not very accommodating
My roommate got one for our room but the issue is in order to install it they literally went and like
Forced my bed out of the way
So we have to buy like
Extra tubing and duct tape to tape the tubing together
Much accomodation

What we have to do for now
So my desk is just kinda split in 2 in the middle of the room
insane setup 💀
It's practically kicking me out of my own room 😭
I thought they had smaller ac units 😭
I was expecting like a window unit
Like obviously they have window units I see them outside some of the buildings
You should ask for a window unit . . . It seems unreasonable to expect y'all to live like that
The price of cool air 🥲
Well well well
How was the first day of classes everyone
pretty chill
Not done :Smoge:
one of my classes doesnt start meeting until after drop/add period thats nice
They're fine
AIQS prof seems interesting
Who
higgins
Ngl I liked mine
She seems nice enough (Daniel)
Gl 🫡
wym good luck is he bad
Iâ€™m just responding to your message
💀
Mb man
My aiqs is next sem
:thumbsup:
Nice
I had him. If you want any advice or stuff I can dm you more later
oh cool, ill let you know if i need anything
That is evil
Like actually foul, why would you set that up
Itâ€™s a 2 way street
I'm definitely gonna be on the lower end of the spectrum but
C's get degrees!
Exactly
Or a job
But we'll see
is ur name red?
Preferred yes
I mean there is the pass/fail system so
Like if you ever meet me in person I will introduce myself as red
this u
smh smh
nice to meet u red
It's Red from OSP
Know what that is
"overly sarcastic productions"
dw its a lot better than the channel name implies
Is cwru usually this hot lol? Like itâ€™s not uncomfortable hot but itâ€™s noticeable so
R
casually
no
give it like two weeks
Cool, or not cool I guess lmao
Please reference the chart for relevant seasonal details
Unironically helpful lmao
It's shockingly accurate lol
I was expecting it to get colder when I went further north
Like bro heat index and I still have to walk 20+ minutes to my classes
bruh
You just gotta love heatstroke man
survive for two weeks
halfway through september and then everyone should be fine (usually. hopefully)
My favorite cookie, 0.3% napkin
How

guys i am going insane

oof
but did your excerpts and solo do well
Yah
what instrument do you play and what ensemble were you auditioning for

it depends on the prof whether they show it or not
seeing the averages is kinda more good than bad tho. cause itâ€™s good to know if your failing grade is consistent with everyone else. and i care more about that than comparing myself to everyone else
Will insomnia count for an accommodation for an AC
Itâ€™s 90 degrees in my dorm
For fucking real
ME NEITHER OMT
I CWNT
Itâ€™s seeping into my brain
ITS SO FUCKIYNG HOT
Give myself hypothermia
Then I got in my dorm

IKR SHOUT OUT TO BEN

Wickenden is right between Yost and sears. Walk in and go very slightly right and thereâ€™s a hallway (small) to a big lecture hall
okokk thank you
I'll have a room to myself next year
:praise:
found my class, thanks!
Big
Big
Yeah it's more likely I get put into them than I don't but hopefully not
It's 400 people like per dorm
💀
Sobbing
It's an ebook and every chapter has a quiz you can only do by having the ebook because it's like a website
So I HAVE to buy the book because it's part of my grade
which book does it happen to be
Evil
It was just the physical version of it so there were no quizzes
I literally HAVE the book and I probably have to get it again 😭😭
the new dorms aren't that bad - im living in them rn and so long as you have a good roomate (thanks @wanningswontons ) its chill (lots more space than top of the hill)
does anyone happen to have the anth 107 book on pdf
How does one navigate tomlinson
I ordered something from here but I don't actually know where to go LMAO
Thanks
I'm probably not going to eat here for the rest of the semester but we shall see
ok who set off the fire alarm on northside 💀

Ayeo!?
but i heard one going off

has anyone ever had her
anyone interested in going around campus with me for some meals to rank all the different dining options?
where is the nursing research building 😭
ok wait I think I found it
alr whats the grading scale like

Lowkey yes
Huh
Just means that it's big news or a positive development
Ah that makes sense
Thanks
How optional is it 5= most optimal, 1= itâ€™s not worth it at all
im down
Ok Iâ€™ll make a gc once I get to a sitting place
let me know specifically what you think about the den
the den is good
Yeah
Guys I keep autopiloting north side
That sounds like a surreal struggle ngl
does anyone have the psych 101 textbook
the best way to guarantee this is to join a greek chapter that only has single rooms tbh
aka one with a house on southside
whats the inquisitve
The hw site
If you have butler
But check the syllabus
@twiningrat NO WAYYYY ANOTHER CS+MATH JOINS THE SERVER
Itâ€™s only the best double major
Second best.
MATH & CS LETS GO
booooo
why are there so many of you
they clone them somewhere
Its just a goated combo
:waaah:
Nothing high level lmao I'm in 120
Struggling is natural and okay in any class smh
Although I did take it 2 years ago
The amount of times I've heard "which you remember from highschool" when I do not in fact remember from highschool 😭
If I had just come from precalc it'd probably be different but
yeah then its expected that youre having a hard time getting back into it
hey guys is it social suicide to triple major
i know a couple triple majors who do okay but also theyre kronked so
what majors
Thats
Insane
i mean of course ill return for a masters and phd for phsics but idk
physics*
with the mathematics + physics pathway it drops a lot of the labs in favor of just one advanced physics lab
can i use as many portable swipes in a day?
up to 14 total in a week?
depends on the place
look up meal swipe plan pdf  cwru on google

I keep having to go back and look at this PDF every time I order to keep track
😭

yeahhhhh
def worth talking to your advisor to see what the ramifications would be
alr
thank u
np gl
Specially with all the free time I (don't) have in the summer
Tmw at leutner at 5:15 pm, show up to watch me make a spinach sandwich
Out here watching ochem teacher for precalc
😭
organic chemistry tutor is goated
But I might test the waters on not doing it
Alright everyone you've (I think?) had all of your classes now
How were they
p fine
Dr. tran is based
sped thru module 1 and was going into mod 2

🙏
Alr sounds good
Thanks
of course
Monitor replaced

ik you probably mean the freshmen but im avoiding my modern reading so im answering now. astro is lovely, modern seems decent so far (and i will probably eat my words once i get to 3.2 in the book), sci fi is great, and electronics lab is. well. e&m and i dont get along
dude your gpu is sagging so much 💀
Yes lmao
Nice NZXT pc
Cyber power
Yeah I took it out once
i walked by stro today and saw all of the freshmen lined up with their blue books to get in 👁ï¸👁ï¸
Astro what
Nvm
You're an astronomy major
sophie is my favorite astronomy major
I'm just in Astro 101
But depending on how this goes I do wanna take higher level Astro courses
I like astronomy in general
Not sure how much it'll translate to academia
it might be worthwhile to get some supports
Gonna sell it and just get a new one
What specs?
3600 and 5600xt
ram?
16 like
ah
gotcha
Anyone else in Clarke sweating to hell rn
https://tenor.com/view/team-fortress2-tf2-spy-drip-funny-gif-22547298
Itâ€™s so over for us
Did yall try keeping ur windows open
Talk to them
I will lmao
my window is staying open until like november at least
good luck
I have my blinds pulled over the open window
otherwise I get radiated in the morning
iâ€™ve found that the blinds are so ineffective that it makes no difference to have them pulled over the fan in the window
what i do is i make the slats go â€œbackwardsâ€ so that they tilt at an angle that stops the sun from glaring while i sleep, vs if i do it the right way around itâ€™s the exact right angle to like shine into my eyes
:>
It's actually pretty cool outside today
me when i lie
??
What are the police doing over at coffee house?
Now
Literally in 5 mins lmao
Ah
I thought I would be in the same room as you but ig not
I'm in 204
I have my first quiz in a couple mins
Oh good luck
💀
Yea
Is it always this hot in the dorms
no
this week is very atypical
Owie
I was doing problems fine like 5 mins before the quiz but as soon as we started I just blanked lmao
lowkey judging from the course descriptions I feel like AP Chem should get you credit for both Chem 105 and 106
Anyone in physics 122 so I can stare at you rn?
where's the Wade Rehearsal Hall?
Or am I spreading misinformation
Itâ€™s at wade commons I think so unless youâ€™re looking for wade building
It may be refrrring to Denison?
there's an entire rehearsal hall in Wade commons?
Yes
Yeah I mean

Itâ€™s just a big room
oh okay
just in Wade?
Yeah
okay
Yup thatâ€™s at wade commons
seems like an odd place for a rehearsal hall but ig it's nice that its near our dorms
All of the instrument lockers and some practice rooms are in wade also
the same wade where the Amazon locker pickups are?
Yes
ohhh okay
Itâ€™s just past a set of doors
oh cool
oof I gotta go from the quad to Wade to thinkbox this afternoon then
😭😭😭
Oof good luck soldier 🫡
10 minutes to get to harkness chapel from the quad am I making it?
If you can hurry a bit
Cool
alr???
hope u get better soon
hopefully
Did it
Saw you
Oops

Spinach sandwich made
theres both
More leaf
hey y'all has anyone taken ntrn 201 recently? if so does anyone have the textbk plsplspls 🙏🙏🙏🙏 🐀
Character building experience
I took it also if you pay absolutely 0 attention the entire semester you can get an A+
As long as you have a general sense of nutrition
And yeah I have the textbook Iâ€™ll dm
@reddishlightning did you meet hannah at glee
I did!
did she say anything weird 💀
Take a guess
yes
considering you told me i should take linear algebra yes
â€¦ how does this have anything to do with Alanâ€™s friend being weird 😭
yes
Hannah was not weird at all
NO
Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ll be there Wednesday \:-)
WHAT
honestly
perfect do it
same
No jk Hannah was fine and not weird
Yâ€™all should come to Glee Club concerts though, at least once
she is very happy to hear that 🤣
yes totally
Iâ€™ll be singing in a solo group
adam singing solo?
that is not an exclusionary criterion
I sing in a quartet every concert
I can understand the sentiment
it is an ensemble designed for folks with little to no singing experience
i only sing in karaoke when its okay to sound bad lol
oh wait actually
thats kinda cool
yep!
okay im intrigued now but
ill think about it
wednesdays are already so packed for me 💀
:0 wait I might have to do glee now if it's fine that I'm bad
you can definitely try it! Come Wednesday at 9 in Wade Denison!
I will think about it
All Iâ€™ll say is, easier to go on Wednesday and then decide itâ€™s not for you then to not go until add/drop is over and have it be too late
thanks!! rlly appreciate it 🙂
@mooneboom IS THAT A YES OR are you wondering the same
Anything from the hw might also be on it
If you struggled with basics do the hw
Thanks 🙏🏽
Right
😞😞😞😞
Those who sleep more are gonna score better
Youâ€™re right
I'll live ig
csds 132?
Yes
It was not on my calendar
So I'll have to spend like my free time today catching up on all of that

Yep everything is off completion
I think he said something about your max grade being the % of "optional" assignments you do
If you only do 90% of them the highest you can get is a 90
Thats basically what it is
Yes
This one is in Dr java
After classes today Im gonna try and like
:rainpain:
lol that's so weird
hi ashton
i knew it was you before even checking mutual servers
Honestly even scarier that it's only tests
Like I think I have a lot of time to refine a project
One and done

Yeesh
so this is crazy
does this mean theres more than 1 midterm?
wait how do u know theres 4 then lol
4 is wild
He said there would be a midterm after each of our programming projects and that theres 4 of those so
is there 4 programming projects and a final project? or is the final project included in those?
The way he talked about the structure of the class was like it had always been this way
Or atleast thats how i interpreted it as he was going over the syllabus
But clearly not
im guessing ur 4th project is just ur final then?
we only had 1 midterm lmao
so im guessing 3 midterms and a final
Maybe? Idk weâ€™ll see as we get further in
!!
Anyone else hear those jets?
Military-looking, maybe f-16s?
Heard them in ANTH 103
its so loud
Nerd emoji
Yeah fr Iâ€™m in Clarke Tower and they were crazy loud
Dude f16s are awesome
I wonder why theyâ€™re flying over here
i wouldnt think so?
Also, just saw a spotted lanternfly, make sure to stomp them if you can
Yes it is morally correct to do so

They wreak absolute havoc on agriculture where I live
Cleveland air show is this weekend I believe
Oh I see
And they fly over campus because PBL is ugly ah hell from the air
I'm not kidding
It is, love this time of year
they're heckling us for having ugly buildings
PBL best looking building on campus
hands down
I think theyâ€™re blue angels(?)
Thatâ€™s what my prof said anyway
yeah I saw one and it looked like it

God I love when the Wepa printers print my file and the bottom third of every file is chopped off
classic wepa
is it common for people to make discord servers for certain classes?
no
It happens decently often
Probably depends on major how much people are likely to use discord
But class or study group group chats of some sort are pretty common
Not necessarily discord
The way it goes among people I know is
- make discord GC for class
- if more than 10 people, make server
makes sense
This happens occasionally
ah I see
The prof for 308 made a Zulip thing
that very much makes sense
my astro prof made one for the class lol
What did they do
Are you talking about the gazillion flyovers?
Super hornets
Ah ok
fa/18s are similar to f16s, Iâ€™m not completely off base lol
The original prototype of the F/A-18 was intended to compete with the F-16 so yeah
🤓
Ye
I just recently learned about how the vtol system on the f-35b works, holy shit itâ€™s awesome
I throughly enjoyed it
Then again I love this stuff
Yo what
No clue
The flying club is going on Monday and I'm going with some other friends here on Sunday
What all is gonna be there?
C-17, Blue Angels, an F-15 flyover, some aerobatics shit, and a lot fo stuff on the ground

Oh yeah an a10 oh my god
My favorite thing about the a10 is that if you hear itâ€¦.. youâ€™re still alive

I was at an airshow in May and got this
Thatâ€™s so cool
Discord compression did me dirty

Some other good ones I found
I heard the saying:
If you hear the A-10â€™s cannon
You werenâ€™t the target
💀
thats interesting

^
top of the hill is kinda nice tbh
esp now that thereâ€™s a dining hall up here
Lazerpig has a pretty good video talking about how shit they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWfsz5R6irs
And here go all the ME, AE, EE, and IE's coming out of the woodworks
it was never meant to be good
it's designed to do as much damage in one pass as possible
ty

Did anyone get the low test scores assignment for terri
is anyone taking engr 131
I am
how is it
I might add it
Itâ€™s eh
You could 100% add it and be fine
alright cool
3
Is anyone taking Muth 103?
Only good for counterinsurgency indeed
Brits when their warrior ifvs get mistaken for enemy armor
So many military/plane nerds here
I love it
Iâ€™m more of a ww2 history type of guy
Also more inclined to like armor than aircraft
oh alright nice
I went to the bovington tank museum two summers ago and it was one of the best times of my life
you definitely have to try and itâ€™s time consuming. but itâ€™s not hard stuff
alright
cause I'm pretty sure I'm gonna add it
this is why
this teacher confuses me
https://i.imgur.com/ZNijQqF.png
like i can understand everything ab the factoring
but where did the fractions come from?
I gotchu
you set each factor equal to 0 and solve
If two numbers multiply to zero, one or the other is zero
Itâ€™s x equals those numbers to get the factored pieces to equal 0
Because multiplying two nonzero things cannot get you zero
I love how 3 people just jumped red and be like â€œI gocchu you
I deserve to do it because I am RedLightning (Red enlightening if you will)
it would be better if that was at all explained in the doc 😭
Nah green enlightenment
just wrote arrows to the fractions like that was helpful somehow

Oh lol
I can do mt but if someone kidnapped me and told me that if I could part write 4 measures to be set free, Iâ€™d prob be ransomed off
My favorite one is the Arjun, which can fire a PCB (standing for penetrating c__ blast)
aural skills is mainly emphasized on the cim side iirc

Makes sense, I have the vocal range from D2 to about E4 (which goes into my falsetto) which makes singing hard lmao
Also wait were you at muap on Wednesday?

Daddy drew just meowed
Can confirm but never say it like that again lmao
Did yâ€™all know you can make a milkshake at Fribbley?
What do swipes get you at Dunkin donuts
its grab and go
there's teas, coffee, bagels, crossanwiches, and sometimes donuts available for pickup
a swipe gets you a drink and one food item
yknow when you walk into frib or leutner there's the little card swiper?
Yea
it'll spit you out at the counter in front of one of those swipe things
just swipe your card, wait for your face to pop up on screen, grab a drink and a food and go
in other places (dunkin is a cafe swipe IIRC) you might have to get in line like at the indian place in Tink, but they'll ask for your card at the start of your order or at checkout and they'll swipe it on the machine for a meal swipe (or case cash if you ask and they accept it)
Would someone in Phys 121 mind sending me their notes from today's lecture
I could barely hear him since there were people in front of me talking the entire time
i dont think a single person knew what was going on lmao
I understood snippets

Oof
Yeah I get that stuff but itâ€™d take me a bit to remember what all of it is
Anyone else here in CSDS 132?
WHAT
NO
😭

Iâ€™m kidding

Guys would the writing resource center help edit my paper?
Thatâ€™s their entire job yeah
I don't remember if it's primarily walk ins or appointments at the center
Appointments iirc
Like thatâ€™s
Good
Right
Thatâ€™s not asking them to write it
Yep! Theyâ€™re there for the entire process. If you have absolutely nothing theyâ€™ll help you brainstorm. Theyâ€™ll help you write, edit, revise, etc.
Okay RHANKS
the director of the writing center is my ENGL 310 prof, dr. parkin, she's a very kind person and would absolutely love to help you
nah nah actually *go* there, it's a lot easier that way
Got it thank you
the website has appointment signups and you can filter by in person, virtual, and asynchronous

It took me like a combined 15 minutes 😭
CS sometimes be like that

Hope you feel better soon! That's no fun.
i think you tell your 4 year advisor iirc

Itâ€™s on SIS Iâ€™m p sure

Ppl on my floor got covid
I may or may not have been put into a medically induced coma my freshman year
I think thereâ€™s an outbreak lowkey
...please elaborate
adam how would you rate the experience
NSFW (possible gory details) ||the phrase â€œmay notâ€ is doing some VERY heavy lifting in that sentence||
have you talked to your professor about the stuff youâ€™re having trouble with? also, everyone gets an hour of free peer tutoring per week. sometimes you just need extra time/help/a different voice explaining for stuff to click
youâ€™re also a math major
but like fr is it possible to have trouble in the calc sequence but be okay in cs classes moving forward? i donâ€™t know how much later cs relies on multivari calc or whatever
If youâ€™re just interested in being a developer then probably whatever
If you are interested in researching ans developing novel things for CS you really gotta know your math, but otherwise if you can code youâ€™re fine
happens happens
i feel like imma consume my words if i say any more about that class
Maybe I'll need physics and stuff if I really wanna game dev but that's a whole different problem
my only regret is not picking something more employable
this might be worth talking to oats about? if you know the material and just blank on tests then maybe a different testing environment/some other accomodation might help?
im not sure how willing oats is to give accomodations tho
his notes r not very helpful at all
https://i.imgur.com/ukPnjJY.png
it's one thing if you already know it because you can fill in the blank but for someone learning for the first time this just looks like a bunch of scribbles and numbers with no real connection
those are a mess jeez
do you take your own notes when he explains in class?
or do his explanations not make sense
ppl from all over the world with local germs from all over the world living alone in close proximity for the first time with questionable hygiene
sometimes he just says "stuff" literally 8 times in a row
and sometimes it makes sense
https://i.imgur.com/qDopZ1R.png

It would be nice if he used genuine examples because I can picture a variable I can picture a number I can't picture "stuff"
thats rough
just that the way he teaches things does not click with the way I understand things which means I'm learning a lot of this by myself
which obviously isn't going so great
That sounds like a very frustrating class
just looked
she teaches 125 for the fall
i'd have to skip a class to go to them 😭
Xe is also pretty good with emails too.
emailt o meet a different time
Id highly recommend emailing xem.
oh wait this is horst teaching 120?

Bro itâ€™s over for me
I should just

Nah it would completely mess up my schedule
And they both count for the same thing so eh Iâ€™ll just deal with it and then forget that matlab exists next semester
I fixed it, thanks
😞

Yes!!!
There were 5 projects in Fall 2021, and starting in Spring 2022 they switched to 4 plus the written assignments

Fribley has really good muffins but they are the only place that does (fribely proper not elephant step)

Leutner > fribley ngl
Thatâ€™s a take of all time
At least for now lmao

Csds 132 officially has 4 midterms 🙃
on the bright side that means no midterm has an inordinate effect on your grade

Thats actually insane what

Yo samesies!!!

i watch vtubers (not much but tragically)
Whatâ€™s a vtuber?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber
im too lazy to give an actual definition but here it is
So YouTube anime?
basically yeah sorta?
theres more nuance then that but that's like a tldr id say
Just use discord
The cool kids app
anyone else watching starliner reentry
I do not lie within that statistics
But it makes sense
i fall heavily under that correlation
i have only spent $40 on merchandise in my life for that
so far
Like who?
Limealicious
Michi Mochivee
Porcelain Maid
Dokibird
Kettletoro
False but okay
thats what i said lmao
a virtual youtuber
the cool kids app for the kids who think building pcs is cool and not doing drugs lmao
so just a youtuber..?
a youtuber or streamer with a live VR avatar
like i said theres more nuance to it but yes
o
i love vtubers 😍
like i said, correlatiion of CS major and vtuber/anime/gacha lmao
i love anime and i'm premed
okay starliner has parachutes deployed (aero major speak)
i'm going
But all that free food
Why not go
okay maybe stem majors in general
I think anime is more interdisciplinary than the others
true
Yeah
yeah
oh hey it's tomorrow
Tbh I think the most I've spent on merch that's sorta anime-related was like $12 at most (I love me gachapon machines)
Gm!
I'm just going to save funds for whatever future artist alley I encounter
fun
starliner is landed!
boeing's reputation can stop bleeding now.
its been going on for FIFTY YEARS
instead of "fixing" whistleblowers
honk
honk
theyve overelongated the 737 is the problem
i like ducks
honky tonky
just they need to bring back smtg like the 757
quack quack
let me kiss u
i have a girlfreind...
(unbelievable i know)
let's share
jk
i'm kidding dude calm down
she's all yours
i legit said jk
im aware lol

they're at william and mary
good school m8
This must be really awkward for you guys
Which is why you go for a midnight run!
Or sleep
????
whats sleep
Something thatâ€™s been fighting with me for a while
Dw we'll keep you awake
That sorta sounds like a threat
Not necessarily
ill bring some pots and pans
both
Choose wisely
If the food is good enough
Iâ€™ll let it slide
What?
I'm not good at cooking
I will have to sacrifice you then
lol
make it flashy
Bet
Very entertaining back read
the outlet in my desk beeps once every 2.3 seconds or so when connected to power
sophie, its a bomb, run...
😭
ur the physics major lol
unironically i have no idea why it would even have the ability to beep
i was playing chess and i was in a completely winning position (up a queen and a rook)
and literally hung mate in one
my ELO dropped 300 points
my elo is poopoo now
not much changed in that regard
Did you already drink from it?
got 2
Yeah, that's why I usually try to carry my stuff with me wherever I go
My old school was relatively safe with that kind of thing, but not everyone is respectful enough in the real world
leutner bathrooms are revoltingly disgusting
Me personally I wouldn't let that slide
slash his tires fr
he's in college you potato
no obvious bike
i would personally track that person down and ruin their life
we finishing our chem111 aleks with this one 🔥
we might get a seizure or two but we ok 🔥


i got a brilliant move in an unranked match 😦
so thank god
They added something new to the Dens menu
Well
Atleast to the meal swipes menu
What did they add?
It was probably already there for other stuff but the pancakes eggs and sausage thing
jump on it its so good
(i have a bias)
AMA first fire alarm
Thank god nobody was showering
i fucking knew it was popcorn related
its always either popcorn or ramen
How about fork
Just fork
Fork vs microwave
lmao
It was good however
Wait two dorms were set off yesterday?
It happens every year
Lmao they took it off already
Actually yeah I think it's late night only it's unavailable even with casecash
They'll sometimes just offer it for one day only
Maybe once or twice a semester
Ahh
Same lmao
Why is chem 111 weirdly loud
à¨œà¨ªà¨¾à¨²à¨®à¨ªà¨¦à©
okaaaaaaayyy
à©€à©ˆà©ˆ
ok
𓇋 𓂧𓈖â€™𓏏 𓈎𓈖𓅃

Oof
no offense to mafu but i can barely understand him
what's he talking about
BRO YOUR ALARM WAS GOING OFF FOR LIKE 10 minutes and then you snoozed it
I SNOOZED IT?!
Did it turn off by itself then???
And I think it did that
on day 1 of classes I slept through my alarm for 15 minutes, smh
(I am roommates with the moom pfp)
THATS WHAT IM SAYJNG
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE A MAN TO TEACH W=FD
I feel like heâ€™d give really good lectures
i took pictures of the slideshow he displayed at the beginning and i feel like i learned more skimming that than actually listening to this lecture
if you could have one professor teach every class, who
covault or butler
i would love that actually
Dr. Fernando, heâ€™s so based and funny
Oh nvm lmao
Itâ€™s duct taped together too
just send pictures if you can
🙏
please and thank you
Dr. Julius my glorious king
make it quantum
insert relativity
string theory
Wait whatâ€™s the deal with the path integral
Does that mean anything whatsoever
do you mean line integrals
The integral with the silly circle in it
if so, run. before the surface integrals get you.
oh that thing
that thingâ€™s fine then
What is it💀
in e&m we basically treated it like a normal integral
Itâ€™s just a normal integral if youâ€™re  given the amount worked
Or smtg
I barely remember mechanics and Iâ€™d need to check my notes for it
How do we stalk our Lab TA to figure out of they will screw us over or not so we can plan ahead for immenent fauilure?
does bibibop take case cash
yes
kousuke ogaki
🐐
y'all no one told me clarke had roaches 😓🙏🙏🙏
i'm fearful
i'm afrighted
i may not survive the night
one litrlly watched me from above my bed the whole goddamn night
got NO sleep bc i was terrified to turn the light off lol
What floor?
Our RA told us theyâ€™re around 2 and 11
But also making their way down from 11 towards 10 iirc
how did they infiltrate the upper floors
this is like attack on titan but vertically
Probably the elevators
Thus they have surrounded us
11 😦
Checks out
we're ordering a fuck ton of raid spray courtesy of malaya (she tells me to tell y'all to vote her for rha prez 😭)
Not happening

Heâ€™s my Suitemate
ohhh okay you're good 🤭🤭â¤ï¸
EVERYONE ELSE vote for malaya â¤ï¸

Vote for weber
Iâ€™m not saying what was going on because this is a public chat
i think they were watching a jjk movie on the 8th floor last night
i genuinely have no clue what was going on last night (cockroach induced amnesia)
i heard there's roaches at 11th
😦
yes
🪳🪳🪳
Guys I have raid prevention spray
😭 dude WHY
I was half not there
But I could hear stuff going on through my walls and headphones
And we have really good sound proofing
ohhhh i did walk past 5 on the staircase a few times i think i heard y'all
We get very active
what floor you at
Mainly because a lot of the girls on our floor bring their friends from other dorms
5
11th floor r lucky they have the new furtniture
They do???
Tf
yeah
my friends room had those tables with outlets in it
OOO yea that's good ngl
Dude Clarke sounds like a dystopia
clarke is the best

freak western
Na this is normal
Supposedly better than the rest of the other dorm buildings
In my opinion my floor has it pretty good so I guess I cans corroborate the claim that itâ€™s pretty well off
postwar architecture
chat are we gonna be okay
Ohh I see, ty
Are these the first caffeinated drinks of today?
not necessarily

â€œMightâ€
No that is a caffeine addiction

Did you have all 3 monsters?
ye
â€¦ how is your heart rate and breathing
it just posted my number
That is strange
well that's usually how it goes
lol
like if I type "I live at" it inserts my address
Mine thankfuly does not do that
that's so creepy
I would assume it just puts your actual current address
yeah
Are you in your dorm right now
?
That would do it
probably
who designed that feature and who thought people would like it
yeah crazy. Like it knows im at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500
lmao
Yes, need any help?
Yes!!!
@leowhygamma imposter
This is not the place for language like that. Consider this a warning
and i'm triggered
ye
Also like is someone out to mess with you? Because it was just recently that someone also messed with your drinks and chess match
i worked my ass off only for some schmuck to be like "HAHAHAHA NO MORE PAGE"
google doc?
Did they take your hw?
they took a singular page
ye
it's physics
why was that accessible to them?
like on the table
guh
sure
why not both
yeah both
lmao
this is case
a school with high IQ kids
the fucking 4th one
like if you need to cheat fine i'm not your dad

â€œThe authors of the original paper claimed to have created an entirely new form or carbon, graphyne, which is fundamentally different common diamond or graphite,â€ said Valentin Rodionov, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, whose team has been investigating the now-retracted work for the past two years.

Jan Hendrik SchÃ¶n moment
science nerd or bobby brocoli watcher

rate the doggo
Edible out of 10 /j
Iâ€™d fight it and Iâ€™d prob win
he'd win


i thought i made you anxious~
Based lmao
@.tobyc you needa know that i still love you no matter what you think â¤ï¸
no homo
Makes one of us
This is one of those LK-99 superconducted-esque articles
he is a bit dumb lol
if he was human he'd probably get admitted to case ngl cuz he can sell himself well
whats his name
rocco
@tazmania40 bruv literally writes for RW
wait did I get put on that?
lol
It is my research group, it's a hell of a story
Itâ€™s rly a Jan Hendrik SchÃ¶n moment again lmao
(Btw if you donâ€™t know who he is, tldr is he lied about his research relating to supercooled semiconductors)
OMG another person who knows the SchÃ¶n scandal
o7
Itâ€™s so interesting
did you also watch the like 2 hour video?
By BobbyBrocoli?
supercooled organics*
If so yes
yeos
YEAHHH ANOTHER BOBBYBROCOLI GUY
Ooh send video that sounds interesting
it's very good
Itâ€™s in 3 parts
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAB-wWbHL7Vsfl4PoQpNsGp61xaDDiZmh&si=7QSBIBKD5QeSqqvz
oh no way thats been on my to watch list
so fun fact there's a new polymers prof coming in spring who studied under Dr. Zhennan Bao at stanford
I'm gonna try and do research in organic electronics under him when he comes
This guys video series Iâ€™d say Iâ€™d be surprised if someone here at cwru didnâ€™t find it interesting lol
i just got solomon asch'd yall 😭
the prof a question i thought was obvious and when everyone else in my row answered a different same answer, i changed my answer
my first answer was right
when is this? I'm asking for a friend btw

Guys good barbers within walking distance from campus that arenâ€™t horribly expensive
thanks
oh yeah those videos are great

â€œ77 minutesâ€
a bit... it was mostly our postdoc but I saw a lot of the reactions and got to see the results of our replication efforts  which led to the retraction
They likely made nothing more than carbon black
september 16 iirc
expect above 80 after like 10 am
wow thats so cool
butler roasted a football player this morning
how many butlers are there
2
Chris Butler and Jennifer Butler (who I'm very sure is his wife)
I think unrelated
Omg I remember that 😭
few head hits xd
write it down and write a novel about it, and later he might read it and be very confused
make him question reality
LOL maybe i should
bonus points if you can make it seem like it was published in 2023
or earlier
She is, sheâ€™s also the Dr. Butler while he is not
she has the doctorate in that relationship
She wears the PhD
Compare their RMPs if needed
Also ABC is providing debate coverage at 9 PM ET
does anyone know where the MUSP 100 classes meet 😭
I'm in Cleveland Institute of Music 017 but I have no clue where that is
J Butler has been fine so far
@bnkoeppen
basement
also theres like a pre-debate special from 8-9 PM
cim is like behind cutter
that's still a 50 min wait lmao
I waited in line though and it was only like 15 min so it was fine
Yeah 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
Honestly i should do that more often
lmao this is actually relatively short compared to what it usually is
very tame
*150 minute wait time flashbacks*
What the-
I saw that reaction lmaoooo @reddishlightning
Wait your @ is also reddishlightning you rly are committed to the bit
Yâ€™all better be watching the debate
Iâ€™m watching cdawgs printing stream highlight
How is it
I mean itâ€™s just as fun as it usually is
Harris is scripted but at least she makes sense
Thatâ€™s about right tbh
Debate is on
Tuned in late but love Harris's eyebrow raise
It's quite interesting how Trump emphasizes a lot of past achievements while Harris emphasizes the future (at least for the parts I caught)
Yeah it definitely is a big difference in approach
Oh man I love this stuff
itâ€™s quite interesting how harris accuses trump of many things he did and trump just starts ranting about immigration or executing babies or whatever
â€œIâ€™m gonna start talking and hopefully people donâ€™t listen too closelyâ€

so my body decided to punish me lmao
i have a sleep schedule akin to that of a gremlin but yes
i am also being severely threatened by my gf to fix my sleep schedule too lmao
does she go here?
true but also i'd rather not lie unneededly
Why was she dating you when you were in 9th grade 💀
idek
this was my same question lmap
Anyways you were helping her with her physics hw in 9th grade? Dang
what
brother you are not the only one who went like this
what
uhhh
i dated one person and we were only 8 months apart
it's questionable
a 19 year old is a bit more than questionable
19 and 14 lol
thats like pedophila
or paedophila to be more specific
certified loverboy certified pedophile wop wop wop wop wop?
FIVE YEARS????

venezuela in relation to the united states inflation rate is insane
I'm very sure there are people who shred US dollars
the biggest spike of inflation venezuela had was from 2017 to 2018
127%
?
we're gonna play a game of higher or lower
higher
273%
higher
420%
higher
785%
higher
895%
still under the actual number
like severely under
1969%
12000%
?
Goodness
higher
That's a lot
higher than this
17000%?
higher
higher than 20k%
Ikr 😭
Mmm that's true
btw answer was about 63k%
https://www.statista.com/statistics/371895/inflation-rate-in-venezuela/
yeah inflation is insane in vene
did i hear the word inflation
*gets shot*

wait did they fix it somewhat?
draw an exchange market and you'll see why this is impossible
vene's just fucked at this point
ah not natural rate change
that's not an exchange market
but yeah
gets the job done
did you take AP econ
this is why i do compsci and not econ lol
no
Wait so then why did the exchange rate stabilize? I'm not good with econ stuff at all
that is to say, i have to wear a compression sleeve constantly, and it gives out on me randomly
Do they do a thing like Egypt does?
That sounds tough
because they did a negative supply shock iirc
to bring it back to equilibrium
What does that mean?
reducing the supply curve
Donâ€™t ask how I got a 4 on AP Econ
I highly doubt that
The latter part
https://youtu.be/7LjzirbEePo?feature=shared
Never forget
Brooo
Also guys fun fact, the dorms handles have usb-a female ports on the bottom so you can plug shit into it probably

Lmao what?
(I have no clue what this does
Will you test them out?
No
Oh true
No I get it
am i a psycho for drawing my x vars like this
no, but you might be a future math teacher

i can whoop chess ass to this song
you're okay for now but once those curves start overlapping and looking like a half-cooked venn diagram we're gonna have problems buddy
@mudrocker are you in chem 111 in 780 seconds
no (yes)
no (yes (no (yes)))
Perfect get doxxed loser /j
Where are you in relation the front anyways lmao
Where you at compared to the right and front
Iâ€™m gonna tackle you /j
middle
4th row, middle section

lol

just make sure you open it once before optining out
Wow Meyer's intent on us making the most out of our tuition
very admirable
Bro Iâ€™ve been doing 2048 for over 20 minutes lmao
I just played one game of it
hadnâ€™t played in years, my high school blocked it
Dang that's harsh
they also blocked anything with â€œunblockedâ€ in the url, so if you type â€œunlockedâ€ into the search bar of like. canvas. or google drive. itâ€™s blocked.
Bro I wrote like 2 things during that lmao
yooo you have chem111 too?
Yep lol
Bro I was not paying attention at all lmao
I rly should start doing physics hw in chem 111 lowkey
I was sorta paying attention, but it's mostly a refresher
wait also cs + premed sounds insane
Do you have physics next by chance?
Same, and kinda common sense for it too
Ah okay
I have phys 122 at like 2:15
Lowkey yes but I might just do a BA
What else are you taking next semester?
yeah I gotta do those labs omfg
Iâ€™d say do a BS + BA, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing
Yes
And with instructions that date to at the latest 2016
I have 14 credits, recently just upped it to 15
While also referencing windows 7 and 8 as modern OSâ€™s
Iâ€™m at 19â€¦
I dream of windows 7
Itâ€™s okay tho a good number of my classes are refreshers
Or easy
Yes
Hello
lmao
Muth 101, chem 111, mude 101, muap 121, and muen 385 is rly easy for me
I am 4th row rightmost in the middle
Based lmao
how do you survive.
I'm starting to try to stand up between stuff
Or do hw
Or more accurately you walk into class, and walk out retaining nothing
well, gl with that.
Real
do y'all have aiqs this sem
next sem
ooo okay
I have it this semester
what's eurhythmics btw
that's a funky word
I have no clue lmao
oh LMAO
I just show up to it
real
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalcroze_eurhythmics
sounds bizarre but interesting
Itâ€™s interesting lmao
also do you have a green lightning pfp just to spite Adam's red lightning
my pfp has invisible lightning
ooo
very cool
Yes
LMAO
Bro they rly playing pumped up kicks at fribley
New record
hello leo
WHAT
the best PE class offered at case
shoutouts to prof sweigart
ooo
what do you do in it?
that's actually insane 😭
you have to be a music major to take it unless u get an exception
basically it helps you associate rhythm with movement and eventually build a stronger internal sense of rhythm
oh wow
that actually sounds really cool
yeah 💀💀💀
sounds very intriguing
its very fun and i started seeing results in my music almost immediately
btw thanks for the help with getting into MUSP 100
very excited to start piano
and it changed how i percieve rhythm and meter period
np navigating cim and stuff is a little weird
yep 😭
lol real
oh cool okay, I'll definitely keep it on my radar
THAT SOUNDS SO COOL WHAT
How does one hypothetically get an exception to join this class?
you talk to someone in the music department
not a guarantee especially because i heard some rumblings about class size issues and cim runs on a different schedule than us
p much and only for music majors at cwru
which are priority over non majors
Hmm that would make sense
Does anybody know about the rugby club (will I get concussed)?
does anyone know if anyone can go into taplin 4th floor (not for concerning reasons)
Tailgate
okay anybody but ritsu lmao
â€¦â€¦why
If youâ€™re in Juniper then yeah
so i can go mildly mess with other people lmao
See, Iâ€™m on Taplin 4
letting people tailgate is a âœ¨security riskâœ¨
Yep, we went to Gas USA the first night
I love how Taplin 4 has gained such a reputation
🅱ï¸ruh
whats the actual crazy dorm this year then
No clue
I mean somebody got beat up and hospitalized in Norton a bit ago
bruh
I know some people who play, I could send you their contact if youâ€™d like
i'm just going to the class anyways

Yeah, that would be great, thanks
Unethical???
What are you scheming?
Chaos
yo wassup
been a bit
the freshmen dorm has ambulances being called over every week i swear
there was a time when the whole crew showed up
@bnkoeppen are you here lmao
u will see me in recital class on november 6th
you coming to kendo today?
I have rehearsal today
Nice, you are still an enigma to who you are to me lmao
i will be at theta chi board game night 7-10pm today
I have rehearsal;-;
Actually I could prob swing by
Iâ€™m joever
Y
Also it is Wednesday
Join me at leutner at like 6:10 for the weekly spinach sandwich
is taplin 4 RA lear?
yes
What
bro skipped his turn just so i wouldn't en passant him lmao
I have to go to skate club

PAWP TF OFF
yes i made a harem to assert dominance over my opponent
Thatâ€™s so many 😭
0/25
Ya
But if I follow my peak/worst plan I can still get A
Okay that's good at least
0/25
Wait out of curiosity who teaches 106?
Bc I will definitely be careful next semester or whenever I take it
:frejard:
Wait are you there rn
I just got here from gym
Iâ€™m a dumbass who locked themselves out of their dorm and had to use the website online and fiddle with it for 5 minutes to get their dorm to open
Ok Iâ€™ll be here for like 15 more mins ish
Gimme 20 more seconds lmao
When they take the spinach away right when I was gonna use it
They put it back
that is certainly a creation
Iâ€™ve been doing it every week
Itâ€™s actually half decent
Noted

What number of scoops are you now on?
Given what I remember from AP Stats, hereâ€™s what I came up with for c
THANK YOU
5b is 4/106
4/105*
Was I right for c?
No itâ€™s 1/3 😕
Dang
Ig that makes sense, 5 out of 6 available positions are not chairperson
Whatâ€™s the answer to a?
I might have something new for c
1/15
Ok
Iâ€™m confident this time
Because there are 6 positions, P(committee) = 6/15
I made the mistake of doing 1/15, which is instead the probability of being selected for 1 specific position
God bless thank you
Since 105 can only be formed via a number thatâ€™s a multiple of 7
Such as 14
ie one less than 15
Solved it
Give me a moment to write it nicely

Stuff below is with names expanded
Lmk if youâ€™d like any clarification 👍
Theyâ€™re 2 giant scoops and they fall off the plate every time
Just eat the ones that fall off smh
THANK YOU SO MUCH
No problem 👍
Good practice for me as well
why am i smiling unconsciously lol
i'm a huge U2 fan
I remember when they had a free album on the iPad
yup. songs of innocence
not their best album
achtung baby or joshua tree is better
Will def listen to those
Also is this prediction gonna be real lmao
(Yes I went that far back in the chat logs for gits and shiggles)
Definitely
Hmm I see
I mean tru, tho we could def try
Some of us here are chronically online anyways
Today has brought amazing news
are you guys reading the server history from the beginning????
woaw
:frejard:
For shits and giggles yes
There are some explore events that are super obvious (if you go on CampusGroups the event thunbnails will say explore)
That might be where the calendar is
On campus groups you can search by the explore tags
finally did the aleks lol
Nice
Why tf are there so many spotted lanternflies
But they seem to especially enjoy the quad
Yeah
That's good
I'm honestly so glad they do that
No
how do i check how many explore credits i currently have
campus groups -> events -> my events -> events i attended
just keep count of which explore events of which type you've been to
nah u good
There's also a "My Checklists" thing under "Your Activity" that tells you the progress you've made
AAAAAAAAAA
fuckkk
fcuk
fcukcf
Dw I got you
Is this combustion?
Anyone who did the phys 122 lab that can help me?
which lab is that? ip?
Dc circuits
@vitis_vinifera
ip is phys121 bro
physics 2
ah
Why are all the explore events during my classes bro
Like I'm not skipping a class for these
Someone should start a lanternfly squishing club fr
cwru_slf
is dr mafu asian
It does
I believe he is from Africa


Bro, did you not buy one like a few weeks ago???
@404wolf ?

@merctai
Probably a dumb question, where can one buy energy drinks around here?

You can dm someone, we have no control over that, but this is not a server to sell things or promote sales

People who have done the phys 121/123 IP lab, did you all also get a much higher value for your predicted acceleration than measured?
Wait the measured one is the one from Logger Pro and Origin right?
Yeah
Ah okay
I got about 0.33 for the measured but roughly 0.39 for the predicted
Ok me too
Ah that's good
Lowkey I'm struggling with the fill-in-the-blank
Itâ€™s just weird, theyâ€™re outside each others margins of error
And yeah the fill in the blank is weird
yeah I got about 0.32 measured and 0.38 predicted
Itâ€™s so strange
I mean that makes 3 of us, so maybe it's okay?

I have no idea what this means but probably
The CIA should force terror suspects to take a semester of Driscoll labs
Dumb question but is kinetic friction friction experienced while the cart accelerates?
While itâ€™s in motion

Not necessarily accelerating

did that guy get arrested

jeezus
or maybe smoking
and the smoke set it off
someone would have gotten arrested had this been the case
true
underage smoking
wait
I thought it's 21 federally

theoretically you could do anything just with the consequences :ahhh:
any illicit substance is 21
smoking, drinking, etc

yes
Youâ€™ll see him again
absolute hotttieeeee
we wuv him
Ah so we might have two semesters with him
i wuv bum most
him*
I think ur the only one
He's got a wife
I think she works here too
She also teaches here
Thought so
Yeah she's my psych 101 teacher
she's actually a psychologist
that's cool

Lowkey tho I like Mr. Butler better
ms butler is cool

you can take me
Yeah, we also get to be part of experiments for the class
like what
do y'all get IQ tests n shi
otis gamma
what was that one for
Literally the description was solve fractions as fast as possible
I have no idea what its significance would be
Hmm lemme check the portal now I'm curious
seems like a lot of fun
It's kinda cool
Most of the actual class time is her reading off of a slideshow stuff that we read about, or some other additional info
what's funny is that i already had my IQ tested for an ADHD evaluation and the AP psych test result was shockingly close
130 on gamma and 125 on the adhd eval
What's the gamma?
the IQ test our ap psych teacher gave us
when we were talking about intelligence
Ohh I see
i'd be signing up for all of them 😭
i love learning about myself
Hmm I suppose you could learn something about yourself from the funky fraction
You would be the participant in their experiments after all
Yeah
I wonder if even if I'm 18 I can ask for a walkthrough of one of the experiments, I would love to see the planning and such behind them
the ones about cognition and learning seem fun
I think my teacher said something about being able to ask researchers to explain the experiment
Iâ€™m also in Psych 101
But with Augustine
You're with Augustine? I heard they're pretty great
She is!
Augustine is very nice, only downside is lots of reading
Same way with Butler I think
Is the textbook the same?
Psychological Science
Seventh Edition by Elizabeth A. Phelps, Elliot T. Berkman, and Michael S. Gazzaniga?
I really hope you'll be able to see them very soon
No, we have Interactive Psychology
Oh I see
Omg I think we get to bring a note sheet for the Phys 121 test
WAIT WHEN IS IT

Whoever made that deserves an award
Should I bring in a speaker to chemistry and play that as loud as possible right before prof meyer says his loudass okay lmao
yes
That would be Zach Baldwin. 
He's a comp E alumni and an engineer at Marvell now
"you could be like bubble bubble bubble bubble or BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE"
Damn nice lmao. Is he aware of the silly impact his thing has made lol
save me chat
do you know how much he pays for the domain per month lol

dr meyer teaching a class full of dr meyers simulator
it's a subdomain
so maybe less
x.y.z = subdomain
y.z = domain
Subdomains are free if you own the domain
But he owns the domain
If you go to the base domain I think he has a website there
what do u think of this @.tobyc
later bro i'm having fun
The stickers
what the empty

get a thumpin speaker
place it right out his dorm
Play shiakiro days to rly mess with him
i'll mix the two
or better yet
get drew meyer himself to scream "OKAYYYYY" right outside his dorm
(am currently using it so i can't get a better picture)
the dorm kids will melt at the sheer sight of dr meyer
Omega Mart????
absolute hottie

yah i went to omega mart a few years ago
it was fun
we wuv dew maya
it is also the source of the only thing with cat ears i own
this summer
the gamestop splatoon 3 preorder stickers lol
Why do we even worship drew meyer anyways lmao like itâ€™s funny but Iâ€™m curious how it even started
i think it's just that chem 111 is a class almost all freshmen take
and a significant amount of the freshmen each year happens to be freaky
eh i'd say about 15%
Random thought: the existence of case western reserve implies the existence of box eastern supply academy
i think 15% is a significatn amount tbh
rather than giving/taking backshots
definitely enough to keep the meyer worship eternal
whatâ€™s the P value lmao
implying that some freshmen wanna get freaky with dr meyer 💀
have you seen sidechat
you sweet summer child
what
hell no
The what
same thing as yikyak
Youâ€™ve opened a box lmao
am i just that innocent 💀
its like. anonymous reddit but for specifically college communities ig
i used to think i was dirty minded af
can someone send me an ss of the sidechat lol
i wanna see
okay the case sidechat is crazy because it's completely anonymous and people are still engagement baiting

The Allen Memorial Library

You all should feel very proud of the antics you got up to.
now back to your regularly scheduled programming
Not exactly. Pass by KSL oval, then the really busy Euclid crosswalk. At that corner, the building there with the big stone stairs is Allen Ford auditorium (and the medical library)

So who's actually here
My Chinese anthropology prof gave us little moon cake quarters in class today
yeah the line hasn'y moved in forever this is Not worth the wait
hmm it's not too late to take the bus somewhere
considering getting boba on my own
Imo Koko bakery has some of the best boba I've had in Cleveland
They have a location in Asia Town and in Coventry I think
I like koko bakery, there are two separate locations here and one of them has the tiramisu boba that was really good
Sweet spot boba on Euclid is also decent
asiatown koko bakery is so much better than coventry koko
chali has good boba too
where can i get caffeine
trust i'm premed i know what i'm talking about

was the boba good
how long is the line 😭
It winds around the room to the tink side entrance

mooncake was yum
boba was not
👍
Was about to say the mooncakes should be fire

Where was it from?
I donâ€™t know any good boba places in Cleveland but in Texas my favorite was Ding Tea so
no idea
the ones off campus i've been to have been mango magno, chali tea, and koko
i know there's a mooncat cafe somewhere too
mango mango so good
a group of friedns just took the table next to mine and are now discussing jjk
mangomango is so aesthetic but pricey too 💸
How much do intro chem professors take off for sig figs
like. maybe -1 point every time it happens
It was 100 poinrs

mangomango also has top tier art
You can contribute to the art wall too if you go, which is really fun

How are bio 214 lab quizzes
imo they were kinda hard and nitpicky but theyâ€™re worth so little
RLY
Theyâ€™re easy af. You just have to understand just a little bit about what youâ€™re doing and youâ€™ll get an A.
Wait but how do I study like I have the farm lab quiz today so do I just memorize all the formulas and the procedure or do I have to memorize the names of all the trees n shit
Or both
protocol
Protocol but both helps
Okay Iâ€™ll just memorize everything else then LOL
tbh the quizzes were very intuitive, i only ever skimmed the protocol
Im taking notes on the protocol
I hope thatâ€™s enough
But Im gonna give myself grace for this one bc I genuinely have no idea what to expect LOL
Itâ€™s an 11 page protocol
are they multiple choice
No I think write in
like fil in the blank or open responde
mine were multiple choice
i think the TAs write them tbh so it probably varies
ohhhh i see i see

Like someoneâ€™s gonna be like â€œa bunch of magnesium to flashbang everyoneâ€ followed by someone throwing copper in there to ensure the flames go out of control
Okay but like what if we burn different things for different color fires?
We can have a blue fire for Case
iirc other colleges (namely texas a&m) do bonfire things
Copper burns blue but it also has the highest temperature so if that happens itâ€™ll become harder to put out
barium is green
i remember that from 6th grade science
And magnesium is white but itâ€™s also blinding to look
sulfur is blue
COPPER
That is true
Alcohol based
<-- gave a d&d player a cursed staff with a sulfur-themed archfiend trapped inside of it, that produced blue fire magic
it also suffocated him with a sulfur smell while he concentrated on spells

how do you do, fellow kids?
WWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
which one do you have?
@snsc has been sitting next to me and heard me go slightly insane
i haven't heard of that one, is the content interesting?
barely lol i got shoved into none of my choices
what kind of work are they making you do
i can confirm
is this for 131?
minimum 1500 word?
phys 122 ;-;
ah yeah phys lab
unfortunate
im gonna try it again later im ramming my brain into a wall with no feedback besides cell loss
also i regret to inform you that a standard paper for a lot of classes is like 2500+ words
what
i quit
yeah 1500 is kinda short lowkey, especially if you start cooking with your writing
so in theory your aiqs prof should be teaching you how to write this kind of paper because it is quite different from the 5 paragraph or 500 words stuff you were doing before
the song i'm listening to is pure irony, hope is the thing that lets me get through my work in like 2 hours magically with all the understanding perfected
but aiqs is a bit fucked
AIQS is very fucked
What's your paper on?
my final aiqs paper was like 5 pages and then i get hit with the 3000 word paper with actual research next time i take a class that requires writing
barely
Hope is the thing with feathers that falls with no air resistance from a height of 69 meters. What is the velocity just before it hits the ground?
my brain goes full "unfocus" mode
btw the 3000 word paper is in your future, MUHI202 with Francesca Brittan
AHGHAHGAHGHAG
she is a great prof and a great person though
great to talk to
this is like half the problem in and of itself
this is a problem
but
and while you're doing those specific readings, start creating an outline of the paper you need to write
and find quotes while you read, rather than needing to go back and pick quotes while you're writing
effectively, you're writing the essay around the quotes rather than finding quotes to fit an essay
wait are our lab reports supposed to be two column or one column or?
although note that while this strategy is effective for me, it may not be for you, so gl lol

sophomore dorms must be (at least slightly) better - free cookie for anyone that can come up with the most accurate reasoning for this
but the options must be, at least slightly, broadened
Sophomore dorms are a lot better. Sure the buildings are still old but having your own bedroom is amazing.

And sure the new sophomore dorms are doubles but at least they are new construction. 

That being said I was glad when I was an upper class men and didn't need to be in the dorms anymore. 
I love my apartment

my brain is already cooked as it is
you can't anyway lol you're underage
🤓🤓
at all
i might just be friends with a lot of drinkers
which is funny because i havent drank anything at all
extrapolating the behavior of a larger group based on a very polarized smaller group
how do you even know they drink lol
they have told me
do you go to parties with them often?
and ive been around them while they are drunk
how large is your friend group?
depends on which one
your drunkards lol
but the one i hang out with the most is like 12 people
your inebriated peers
then that's probably just statistical likelihood
it is
especially on cwru's campus where officers crash almost every fucking party
one of my friends got sobriety'd by an officer while walking back from some random frat party
I can assure you thatâ€™s not what happens lol
then what does? jw
i'm being cautious because getting into legal hot water in your first year is absolutely crippling for grad admissions

Guys marriage pact just droppedn
i got my friends gf.
STOP💀
im act done w ts
Dang
💀
why is your friend's gf doing the marriage pact
:PES_Suspicious:
multiple of my friends who are dating people signed up
sam tell me who it is
Iâ€™ll message you bro
i mean from what i heard its all j shits and gigs
yeah it's pretty much just for fun and "hey maybe..."
(lmao)
idrm, i was doing it for shits and gigs
same
then just go for it?? 💀
get close to, ask, if no that's okay if yes that's okay too
that's how it usually goes
marriagepact ironically just complicated it 💀
i like the concept but it's fallable when you ask teenagers to fill it out
you can fill it out every year right
💀
MP is only if you have your eyes on absolutely no one imo
Couldve found you by happenstance
See I would have liked to know this beforehand
or if. you're doing it just for the funnies.
or that
but say if you're doing it seriously and your match is doing it for funny...
BUT say you're doing it for funny and your match is doing it for serious... 🤨
who knows
then you're locked in lmfao
depends on how good of a person you are
either way, you have the power
that's why i would never do it for funny
but it's multidimensional in that you're also crushing someone's dreams of potentially finding a partner
more likely their dreams of having the obsession applied to a different uninterested person instead of to me
but iâ€™m also biased having filled it out as an aroace person 💀
valid lol
exactly
I filled it out once and sent an email to my match but never got a reply lol
lmao
I'm guessing this is about the average marriage pact experience
Eh it's silly goofy
but some dumbasses might stalk their match even if they explicitly demonstrated disinterest 💀
get your feelings out about someone you like and if they notice that you're noticing or notice you as well, then you have a match

strong tism debuff
yeah I'm thinking I should've done it ngl. when it got mentioned today I was like "wait I think I should" but then the next words were "it just closed"
yea they kept on extending it
but you can do it next year right
yea prolly
there's always next year, yeah
you should have already received your person
no?

I got my person

writing an email
writing emails: the bane of existence to procrastinators since the dawn of time
eh yeah following at t = 0 would be extremely weird
eh I know a lot of people who are just following on insta
shrug
To me not having an insta presence is kind of a green flag
like on the one hand slay touching grass on the other hand. so much easier to send reels if i can send to another user vs copying link
my instagram presence is entirely never posting anything and watching the stories of people I follow. plus the one time I posted a story about the cleveland airshow.
it's a worthwhile existence.
Exactly
Or both
lol yes same 😭
I have one but there are only two reasons
so true
like i j asked a man to build legos with me and now heâ€™s my boyfriend of 2 years idfk
Based
optimal love story ngl
Love at first sight as they say
we do have the best love story tbh we also met in a parking lot
About a year before legos
Mine asked me out while I was working and made me think they were playing some 6th dimensional chess move against me
Mood
Met thru tkd and âœ¨genshinâœ¨ (cringe I know)
me when i was being â€œconfusingâ€
Average male experience of dating lmao
Ngl a pretty good amount of my friendships started with Genshin
Literally oblivious and would ignore every sign under the sun if it meant they were able to do some incredibly niche funny thing
No way
we started dating less than a month later
oh and he also let me meet his mom before we started dating and when we were still in the â€œconfusingâ€ stage
Extremely average male moment of a pre relationship relationship status
this entire conversation is so real
As yes, the â€œoblivious maleâ€ trope
men are just oblivious he acts like i was playing chess
Many tropes are based on patterns of reality
i talk to my friends about my experiences and every time they call me an idiot for not picking up on things
i always realize it right after too
why
Same
Mood
itâ€™s a self preservation tactic tbh. in hs a boy that i liked told me he was flirting with me after i kept rejecting him unintentionally
we still did not date after that LOL
Not even friends?
it was a weird kind of friendship
Me who managed to date an Aro/ace person and they switched to being Demi instead lmao
we were both at the top of our respective classes (he was the year below me) so we had this mutual respect kinda thing going on
Understandable honestly
fun fact my current bf is the first person i have dated or gotten close to dating that was actually older than me
yeah i mean if you guys were largely on good terms then youre chilling. we erm. were not
i have not spoken to him since my graduation day also
so
my highschool relationship was certainly an experience
mine was too
she dropped hints that she liked me for like 5 months
Same here
Same
so it took me 5 months to even ask her out
the relationship itself went fine
Dang
Also @whywouldibearnav did you order smtg from the den
i procrastinated breaking up with them for multiple months also which was. not the best thing i have ever done. not my proudest moment
i was already wanting to break up with them
Ah
Absolute mood
but the guy motivated me to actually break it off
so itâ€™s not like
woh we're getting senior lore
she was inconveniently in my main friend group so i kinda had to rebuild my social groups at the end of my junior year
this is like my junior year of high school lore
it was an experience
Are you saying people started turning against you because of all that?
thatâ€™s why i procrastinated
High five *no this is just fucking a tragedy lmao*
kinda? most of them were better friends with her than me
SAME
this is rizz
I see
so i felt as if they would take her side so i just prevented it by burning bridges
truly the sapphic experience of the year 2019
Iâ€™m gonna hit you (in Minecraft), never say those words again

disclaimer: DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS

Ah, nevermind
this was coachella 2016. this was the vibe at the time
it kinda sucked still but my senior year i had a group of good friends
This is the longest it's ever been for me
Before this was like 30 mins max
wow
ur lucky
does the app accirately say how long itll take?
For some places yes, others no
for den specifically
Thatâ€™s good, so long as you ended up in a good place
i had two, three hour den orders my freshman year
It also depends on the time too
I love how disconnected all of these conversations are
ik
multitasking
what.
red has secret priority den orders i guess
but yeah usually it's over an hour
Average discord moment
Could just be because I order earlier in the day
Den is usually my dinner so I order at like 5-6 pm
yeah if you order before ~8pm its faster
This an outlier for me 😭
You really do have a secret pass
general is for chaos
I suppose
Hey, Iâ€™m here for it
Also in most cases, milling machines or cnc mills over getting an actual partner in many instances
So true
real
Should I post it again in memes lmao
Go for it
For the context
milling machine >>>

ngl
At least you know what to expect
you really come in here saying bullshit with 100% confidence its fascinating
wait fr?
but that's shifting the goalpost not a curve per se
not sure if that was the cutoff for a b or anything but
Aka no curve right from the gate, but curved post haste?
yeah sure but its preferable to curving bc no one ends up with a lower grade than they would have otherwise
Interesting
I was surprised that we only had to know like. one polyatomic ion. and it was in a problem identical to a discussion question.
I was so stressed about memorizing all of them
so your actual test grades or whatever dont change, but what letter your final number grade corresponds to might
True
Hmm I see
Hopefully I did well enough to make the cutoff then 🙏
Thatâ€™s all I can do
Yeah

Chem 111 at least when I took an A was >88
Can you guys get me one? /j
Idc, leutner still better
crazy take
Not rly? My high school did 90 as the A grade, and the only way to get a max weighted GPA (aka the one used to determine our rank) was getting a 100%
If you have had good high school chem and are very comfortable with dimensional analysis it is not that difficult. 

If you struggle with dimensional analysis it is brutal
that's how it worked
Not so crazy take in the foodmaxxing server
dimensional anal is easy
Nah
Easiest way to DA: figure out what unit is needed, and reverse your way back to it
eh that's more physics
tbh yeah

my sophomore hoco date asked me out with pink floyd
she was nice but frankly if she had been a downright dickhead and asked me out with pink, i would seriously consider it
if i do some digging into my icloud i might find hoco pics 🤔
Eh, I'm not sure about that at all Kyle
and U2
U2 > Pink Floyd
ask me out with "U2 - All I want is you" and even if you have the candidacy of a common ant, I would most likely say yes
Wait is U2 the group on your banner?
yeah
bono is leading the charge as always
wheeeeeee
bro i've *been* yapping about U2
it goes U2 > Pink Floyd > Radiohead > anything else
for me
The only 3 bands that matter

I'm actually starting a cult 
What about you?
I am not starting a cult right now
That leaves a great number of possible activities, which one?
I am sitting
Very specific
By chance, are you procrastinating your physics hw?
Ohhhh that's not good lol
Why are you procrastinating then lol
Hmm yeah the legs are different
Ty 😭
Hi clarisse!!!
Hi Iris
How's it going?
From whom?
How are you?
Pretty good!!
That's good to hear!
Also can I join your cult?
Whatâ€™s this cult about?
When I said that tho, I was just joking around bc I was hanging out w @s.uperman at that point (along w another friend) so he knew what I was up to lol
Is this cult in Stardew Valley or is it a cult related to Stardew Valley?
It might be a running crab spider?
Or a longlegged crab spider
Or a fishing spider

A fake one 😭 🤣
what would the cult be about
Will they start changing the ochem curriculums a bit then in the next few years?

why can we not have normal printers
sounds absurd? it is
the printer at fribley just scammed me out of 4 dollars
printed my resume just gave me blank pages
lol maybe in this decade. But single electron sigma bonds arent the norm and it seemed like it needed specific molecules that would be stable and also form some sort of radical. Maybe Sri or Liang would get a kick out of it if you showed them
i paid 4 dollars for 20 blank pages
You could always file a dispute
how
Anyways, the game is the game
what
I just pinged you so you could correct the pluralization LOL
Can I take the empty paper from you lmao
Also I have met Arnav
bro i paid 8 dollars for this
let me at least keep some of it lol
jk take it
Do it after you get refunded

so true! erm ackshually itâ€™s curricula 🤓â˜ï¸
why were you using casecash and not wepa money for printing
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1114856508920971354/1238187317420883988/IMG_0614.gif

yeah wh
use your wepa credits
Do wepa credits renew themselves after each semester or do you end up using cashcase after a few semesters for everything
they reset

spamming "okay" was therapy lol
Arnav certainly does
esp max volume
i fucked with a noisy dorm mate with it 😂
Was it that one person who played music super loud?
yup
imagine they thought that dr meyer was actually there lol
Do you have a formula?

My guess would be to sin-1 whatever you found sin(theta) to equal
So sin-1(11.8) +/- sin-1(1.17)
But considering it says theta = sin-1(sin(theta))
Thatâ€™s my best guess

I was looking at all the education program stuff
"Students admitted prior to Fall 2024 can pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in Teacher Education as a second major while fulfilling the requirements for their primary major."
But now it's not accepting students
My backup career option was to be a teacher but 😭
Why are they not accepting people now?
unless one of my professors is a troll, safe bet to say that we ain't have any more exams in the near future
imma be real you can get certifications and there are a lot of districts who will take you
If I ever have to resort to my backup I might get my degree in poli sci and be a history/gov teacher
Weird. I would email to ask if they plan on accepting students to the program again

no
You take a function of x and you call it y
Take any xâ‚€ that you care to try
You make a little change and call it Î”x
The corresponding change in y is what you find next
And then you take the quotient and now carefully
Send Î”x to 0 and I think you'll see
That what the limit gives us if our work all checks
Is what we call dy/dx

why does that shit look like it'll irradiate your entire system
i got womp womp'd by chase
Because it will
i asked them to ship it to case and they said "nope it has to be your permanent address"
Thank you Chase 🙏
smart thinking
i love u
though I'd minimize the amount you use it regardless
ur actually brilliant
ty
ty
i'm actually squealing in joy
ty
sm
i love you
if I am, then keep your caffeine intake normal for the next month or so
not a brilliant
this a blunder
:blunder:
in general a human should not drink more than about 200 mg of caffeine a day at a maximum
i got limited to 400 so HA
"much less than 400" but whatever
whatever that means
bestie please keep yourself lower than 400
Preach
that means the goal is less than like 200
Ideally 0 is what I say
i'd just be sobbing all day
chase should have a way to add it via the chase app
hmmm
correct, I say 200 mg is a good maximum for folks who are already doing too much
Like tantalus and the fruit tree
i worked my ass off as a CNA and medical assistant in order to get every penny of that 1K
400 is literally the safe adult limit
i mean yeah but like
fuuuuck
ok
What he said

ive been hunting for energy drinks that i can legally drink
what in energy drinks does ncaa ban?
L-taurine or smth
taurine is an AA in and of itself
taurine promotes neurogenesis
i.e. growth of new neurons
so yeah
so basically i have to either drink an insane amount of coffee or just thug it out
me too bro
we drink coffee together
coffee drinking party
we do well
gonna have to use two meal swipes a day on dunkin to survive my dogshit sleep schedule
i feel like the theta chi parties feature coffee instead of alcohol lol
this is false???
is what I'm sayin
threshold of what?
https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ssi/substance/2024-25/2024-25NCAA_BannedSubstances.pdf
albuterol is for asthma
you can abuse it for certain sports
see the amount of footballers who use inhalers presumably for asthma compared to other sports and the general population
alcohol is not allowed in the house
oh wait so im not cooked
wooooo
not in theta chi but elsewhere 🤷â€â™‚ï¸
methinks
yeah i know
real as hell for that tbh
i'm saying that there's alcohol at other frat houses probs
its a great time
not as many as u would think

just 100% anxiety

Don't worry, everything will be okay
i know i blundered heavily
i just know it
my thinking is so blurry rn
hhh
i don
i'm not gonna check
you'll do fine
cs get degrees
ah
well
Right now I think you've just got to try to take things one at a time as best you can
you'll be fine
for such a deep reason that if i say it here, it'll just turn into a trauma dump which is something i don't wanna do
learn from your mistakes and do better
channel the energy of this failure into application essays
it also might not be that much of a failure
everything will end up fine

my coping mechanism (this was actually a super good game lol)
"everything is going to be okay, we will all be okay"

This guy isnâ€™t some icon like George Clooney where everyone refers to him by full name
Heâ€™s just a chem professor that is a certified opp

Agreed
That would be correct however my opinion of him is based on emails
Yeah I can this guy is a complete opp
Idgaf what anyone else says
i am humanities major chem is too complicated for my drawing in coloring books vibes
Also 105 is historically a weed out course because of him as well
Burn the Meyer naysayer!
But Iâ€™m all for natural selection

The people have spoken Arnav
vp debate let's go
that's our senator!
🥱
(jk)
Why do they speak so much better than Harris and Trump
was about to say younger but only vance is
walz is 60. harris is 59. trump is 78. vance is 40
All young compared Trump
40!? Dang
it's like vance and trump memorized a bunch of talking points and then had to go "wait crap" and ctrl+f every "joe biden" into a "kamala harris"
i got the dreaded meyer email lol
the one that says "your test sucked do better"
Ope
What can you do, you just gotta sell
The VP literally does literally nothing besides the tie breaking vote
exactly
but vance has absolutely no idea how to otherwise attack her
so he copes
Yeah
Also Cabinet
I love how waltz is taking notes
Very cutesy, very demure
honestly chem results took my will to do well rn so i'm just gonna watch with y'all
That kind of speech is banned in this channel
Which one
the "haha you fucking dumbass you did horribly on the test" one
😭
Except nicer I assume haha
i have an attentional impairment
Did you file with disability?
yup
but i got the email the day before the test
logically, there's no way for me to have gotten my accommodations
:/
Did you talk to him?
yup
Whatâ€™d daddy say
only accomms can do that
i'm struggling af
this but a coping mechanism
LMAO SEND ME A LINK TO THE DEBATE
Itâ€™s on cnn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZCwKxn-ATU
Rn they're talking about abortion rights
Now itâ€™s on break
Shouldâ€™ve done a discord watch party
Ah, my stream must be lagging a bit then
Wait
We can
I have a tv in my room and watching it there
Woah
Nice
"how we actually do it" maybe do it first because every time you said this it's been a "haha nvm"
say "make schools safer" one more fucking time i dare you
omfg is he making this about immigration
oh heâ€™s making it about cops
man
bro has ADHD
oh right he already made it about immigration
That is literally the only thing they are running on
STOP TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION YOU FELINE
LMAO
he legit just said "that's not my problem"
AHAH
vance hears immigration: itâ€™s free real estate
HE MADE IT ABOUT OIL?!?
STOP DICKRIDING TRUMP AND MAKE SOME POLICIES GODDAMN
I think itâ€™s easy to forget that with all the revisionism vance is doing about trumpâ€™s positions, people have MEMORIES. they know walz is telling the truth about what trump ran on.

not to u
to walz
lol
Why does Vance look so round??
baby face filter
Real
lmao
walz is rebooting
Walz is doing much better after the break
Fr
They gave him the good old pep talk
â€œand PART of it is to be moralâ€¦â€ walz YOUR PROGRESSIVE IS SHOWING
Good
heâ€™s having to be so centrist but he makes these snide asides
â€œIâ€™m JD Vance, certified human being. I have a wife, and three beautiful kids, and I love them very much. To protect them, we have to get all of the illegal aliens out of American families in order to protect American jobs. I have three beautiful kids, and we have to protect them.â€
I honestly believe that there is a higher chance of jd Vance being a lizard then mark Zuckerberg
shocked
shares a higher DNA percentage lol
did my man just use a racial slur
or did i mishear
guys
vance is going to be our senator for another few years BEST case scenario

Bro what
Is it 2 or 6
Where is the 6 number coming from 😭
Presumably 6 total and youâ€™ve already done 4 of them
What's throwing me off is I only recall going to one
I'm pretty sure I only have one left to go to
wait i have an idea
Consider that learning about anything, even menstrual health, is not reserved for any particular set of people and that you might derive some benefit from understanding pieces of those different from yourself
need extra credit -> ur trans or have a gf/sister -> attend -> free extra credit -> profit
Also thereâ€™s a raffle
yeah lol i'm joking
if ur pre-health it's probably important too
The raffle is the important thing here
you can go on campus groups and filter by attended events with the explore tag
ah
2 for every 6 week is what itâ€™s saying
i may be cooked perchance
Bro
Also who was going to town on it???

HvZ counts as an explore event FYI
👀
just attend one mission and you will get credit
(im too core pilled must promote this every single second)
core **pilled**
Wait where to find this again
Campus Groups -> My Activity -> My Checklists
I've only done that on the website tho, not sure if it's different on the app
Just use the website
^
man I'm so glad I don't have to worry about explore credits anymore HAHA
i'm FUCKED
Check #polls arnav
Yeah, you might want to plan things out now and put it on a calendar or something
They give you lots of opportunities for explore
@cynical_socialist

of course it's cg
0/10 app
cg mobile makes me wanna jump off a bridge

Just a small part of is cracked
Also tfw you see bobbybrocoli is about to post soon
cant wait
wait if 2 vegans fight, is it still considered a beef
yes
I mean they both will beet eachother up
I have to find an explore event by the 7th
It'll probably be fine

meyersâ€™s lecture is an exothermic reaction
Iâ€™m doing/attempting calc 3 review

I love how drew meyer is the most drew meyer teacher and then he just pulls stunts like this.
just out of nowhere
mystic gang lets goo
Also ingress is better (I played it for years before PokÃ©mon go was a thing)
ok
what did he do
Can I join?
wait he bought them personally??
no idea
but the people said to thank him or something
Sheâ€™s Asian like many of us

very descriptive leo 💀
I love drew
Lol it's okay, I think you're in my CS lab section so that's why I think I know what you look like
Wait are we meeting outside or something rn?
WAIT REALLY

You have the clear glasses right?

This is from a singular slice
yeah frib pizza is interesting
leutner?
fribby
Frib
Iâ€™ve done my very best to avoid using dining halls these days.
like yeah okay its greasy but luetner is greasy and soggy at the same time
leutner pizza is SOMETIMES edible. most often soggy cardboard.
I donâ€™t take the leutner pizza
Fribley pizza > leutner pizza
:(
Dapped up the pizza with more paper towels than two guys gayly dapping each other
gayly
Amen

They do be free birding today
Bro youâ€™re not any better lmao
Tbh
none of us can talk weâ€™re all on our phones right now
I stand with him
Thatâ€™s just an average day of being Leo
how 😭
Where do you go for lunch on weekdays
Itâ€™s only convenient when your morning class is at CIM at 8:25 or youâ€™re too lazy to walk
its closer to the quad than leutner but ig you can do tomlinson or tink
Always tomlinson or tink?
Tink
m/w/f I either have no classes after lunch or a big break until next class, so I go back to leutner and dorms. tuesday I have absolutely no time to eat so for lunch I have a bagel from nord in the morning and a sushi roll from tomlinson in the afternoon.
Noted
Makes sense
if yall arenâ€™t using the mobile order app get on that fr
eventually theyâ€™ll add the stuff in tink and then itâ€™ll be properly useful
mobile order only for den
oh I use it so much.
I love it so much
and jolly milkshake
but i eat at tomlinson or grab it for lunch usually
choolah mobile order would go hrad
Emma has the taste palette of a 5 year old
that shit would have a 2 hour wait time fr
LET ME DRINK MY RED 40 IN PEACE
YOU JSUT HAD PIZZA ICE CREAM AND GATORADE
You think Choolahâ€™s getting a mobile order? 💀
Whats the problem?
man on friday I mobile ordered from the den. it said itâ€™d take 7 minutes. it took like 30. there were orders made like twenty minutes after mine that got done first.
Den usually takes an hour after 9pm
Yeah
it was like 7:30
ah
yeah the den is notable for the time being not accurate at all
I think having choolah on mobile order would mess up the entire system
noted.
Wait times would be abysmal
Maybe i should pay attention to physics for a minute so i know whats going on
The time for den at night is whatever time you order at, expect it at minimum to take another 40 min after it
@whywouldibearnav did you just say the Ms are killed?
Maybe you should
Dunkin line is gonna be crazy for the rest of the day, those gift cards are gonna break the economy

When did you start sleeping?
fun
Good question
Which one?

Iâ€™m curious now
Oh wait I am so dumb mb
The vector expression thing is confusing me lol
Also 2c is insane
From my understanding at least the vector expression is basically just the components of the vector added together
Then the i hat and j hat just correspond to the direction, so instead of drawing the arrow on top of the Vx part we just say Vx i hat so we know that the specific direction is the x direction
And for 2c, yeah lmao
Make sure you use the ac = v^2 / r for that one
And I have an answer for it although I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct, but I can try to walk you through it if you'd like

Thatâ€™s the terminology

🇮
for the chem 111 quiz is it going to just be forming net ionic equations?
I think he mention redox reactions and acid base reaction too
If youâ€™re working with aqueous substances most likely meyer expects solubility rules memorized
I think that was for the test, no?
guys look outside

itâ€™s so wild to me that people (tech bros) (oh nvm tech bros arenâ€™t people) think chatgpt is the future of humanity
ChatGPT is great at basic tasks
Itâ€™s like they think itâ€™s magic or something
Itâ€™s like a gun in Harry Potter
I think most people misunderstand how it works and what it's good for
oh definitely
Iâ€™d call it a failure in communication but it was actually a very intentional marketing move so
and it's very good at seeming to know what it's doing which can be very misleading for people without knowledge on the thing they're generating
yep
Me when I see coolermaster say that they have AI thermal paste
😭😭😭
what does that even mean 😭
I survive ai misunderstanding solely because I watched a few codebullet and carykh videos over covid

which headphones did you recommend?
i like headphones to an extent
that's right! it goes in the square hole!

This is why I love pokemon roblox
Audio-Technica but I was looking at the more reasonable ones
Also it is Wednesday

Tonights northern lights forcast
9PM-2AM i think
yep
look north and take long exposure photos
my cochlear implant is legit bugging out
probably the geomagnetic storm
Oh my, it might be
worth a shot to see if we can see aurorae this evening
meet up in tink?
If you guys end up doing so, please send some pics!!! I wanna see them :D
@katsukurry_32009 @mism0937 @brokenbladeofmystery @leowhygamma 
watch party?
sure
meet up at tink dink at 6?
8-9 is better probably
both for seeing the lights and because I have rocket team until 8
peak looks like itâ€™ll be around 11
alr
but we should coordinate at 6
imo

he heard the "checkmate" sound on chess.com and saw "black wins" and said "MOTHERFUCKER"
pounded his keyboard
Iâ€™ll let you guys know if I see anything on my end tho
Youâ€™ll start foaming at the mouth soon enough
I prefer 8 or 9 meetup
I have small group sectional today so nah
no
unless u have a different good reason to drop
Freshman forgiveness is best used for classes that would otherwise be an F, a withdrawal, or occasionally a D
🙃
right then tink @ 8 for aurora. viewing starts at 9.
Maybe if itâ€™s a big photo Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
I only have 11,604 photos and videos on my phone, that's not the most it's had ;-;
This is what Iâ€™ve got rn
Iâ€™m on the quad, too many lights. Iâ€™ll take a photo once I get to a darker spot.
Iâ€™m at the baseball field rn but the house lights are kinda rough
So prettyyy
Iâ€™m in tink
Wait how are you guys taking photos of it? At least on my phone everything still looks blue
I got a hint of green in a photo but itâ€™s still way to bright with all the lights

Oooo I see it!!!
Are you using a phone?
oh nvm I think thatâ€™s just flate
goat
glare
frozen fingers
Forget which one though
Took this
In the summer
I got really lucky with the may one
Woah!
wow that's beautiful...
Got it!!! Tysm!!!
Np
oh youâ€™re right I should try turning the exposure lower for less glare
Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s light pollution
yeah
You can kinda see it in this one
are they common to see here??
In the Midwest, not so much
Iâ€™m guessing Ohio is similar
now I really wanna see them 🥲
Iâ€™m heading to Carlton to see if itâ€™s any darker there
Iâ€™m tempted to go all the way up to the lake next time we get a shot at northern lights
Would def be better for light pollution lol
Itâ€™d probably be gorgeous up there
It is pretty up there from photos Iâ€™ve seen

kp index rn is 8.67

out of 9
Guys is this it 💀 it looks purple
various spots around campus. I think the occasional pink at the bottom might be it.
You did it!
Iâ€™m seeing something similar

itâ€™s definitely there
turns out the best spot to see it is just straight up my dorm window
Surely we can do better though
Thereâ€™s some green low on the horizon rn
Supposedly
yeah
Just got this as well
ooh bice
Wait i can fainly see the green now!!
🥳
That one is really pretty
this is a PSA: if youâ€™re in your dorm room, turn the lights off if you can. small difference but itâ€™ll help.
Hmm maybe
also you'll take better ones yourself if your lights are off lol

That one is so good!

itâ€™s so cool how weâ€™re all seeing the same shape of it
Yeah lol

true
Off topic: anyone here not planning on using their jolly swipes?
Telescope?
Yes (:
Sweet
Anyone?

meet at KSL

Iâ€™m a bit far now

What time is best to see them tonight?
bet
where
South side scholar
bet
i'll do it
come
Green tea mango with lychee jelly please
also you have to trek up to carlton
Itâ€™s faint
SOUTHSIDE SCHOLAR
tippit tea operates off jolly swipes
It may get stronger, but for now, those photos are all I have
sugar?
Half
type of milk?
Make sure itâ€™s mango green tea
Not the other one
Show me the screen before you order


Have you swiped for jolly twice this week?
yup i think
🤦â€â™‚ï¸
Two is the limit
i have failed you
daddy kyle
Otherwise Iâ€™m staying put
@casasdefender swiped u
@mism0937
now come
lmfaoooooooo
Much obliged
Iâ€™ll be there now
this is more for him, i'm chilling
Iâ€™d like to thank you as well
no problem lmao
meet @ front
Give me some time to get the thing
@mism0937 can you pick something up for me
or will you steal it
NOoooooooo
Ahhhh
Holding out hope that itâ€™ll come back later
No ;-;

Hmm it seems to be getting better over here
Maybe it's moving down somehow?
AAAAAA
3 coffees
brilliant move
:brilliant:
Arnav nooo
what
ALEKS is a bitch

thats so pretty
Woah
Yâ€™all go outside rn




Fucking sweet
I can go back

😍
noice
will aurora reapear tomorrow or just today
maybe tomorrow
maybe saturday
but with all this solar activity we'll probably see it a LOT more in the coming two years
solar maximum is actually NEXT year

Okay wait
Hypothetical question
yes?
binary exists
Yeah
Genie loophole
oh wait
no UNABLE to count to 1 or 0
so
hmmm
no what the genie would do is remove 1 and 0 form existence and make the minimum value 2
you kinda just have to make it incapable of comprehending numbers at all

That works
However a more interesting idea is what if we made it unable to enforce its own rules
This would cause an interesting paradox
I think it might be best to go with "a universe which is a replica of this one sans rules against meta-wishes" though
xkcd wins this one
I wonder whatâ€™s a weird insane question that poses no real concern in an average day yet has infinite potential
I'll go with that one chem 111 exam question
"can you change subscript numbers to balance an equation"
or whatever it was
The existence of case western reserve implies the existence of bagged eastern supply college
our evil twin
BESC
Additionally, it implies the half way points of lock southern infantry institute and key northern storage facility
Anyways did you guys finish your ALEKS?
yep
224
tis back

When I see you next time I wanna hear this
Any other takers?
@jschlanket Where did you take pictures last night, that park looks super good for viewing

@mudrocker
Help
What classical conditioning process did you undergo???
what
the feet smell was just a neutral stimulus
Prob one that involved some sort of power imbalance
why did you put your full name now
and new pfp??
Itâ€™s to signify the Gojo simping
their pfp was already gojo
yeah prolly
dw

Gojo as a character is mid

the entire manga??
Yeah
Itâ€™s just okay
The opening arc and shibuya arc is strong
Kinda falls off from there
bro does not get the vision
👟
The fights with sukuna is decent
I hope you jam your toe on a doorframe sometime this week
🐾 :shoe:
stop talking
bc no spoilers  i mean
opening arc???
@leowhygamma 🐾 👟
The like first arc before the shibuya incident
nvmd bro does get the vision
And the movie set before the introduction of yuta is good
SIGMA
huh?
MEYER HAS BRAINROT
YUS
The part between shibuya and sukuna fight is mid
What.
MEYER HAS SKIBIDI BRAINROT
it is a letter
therebis only 1 movie and it's the one featuring yuta
I'll never have meyer but this guy is such a fascinating creature to me
SIGMA
Itâ€™s âˆ‘
Î£
Yeah that one is good imo
he is literally quite normal it's us who are weird 💀
Î£Î£Î£Î£Î£
Ohhhh ok that makes a lot more sense
whatever you say, pretty feet 🤤
âˆ‘ can be used as a cursed E by doing ~~ âˆ‘~~
Yall are a bunch of freaks fr fr /affectionate
what other movie r u talking about lol
whatever you say, pretty feet 🤤
we are freaks /derogatory
I think weâ€™re talking about the same thing just referring it in different ways
Yeah but I'm calling yall freaks affectionately
However in stark contrast if we talking my favorite anime nothing beats Rascal Does Not Dream of a Bunny Girl Senpai
I meant as in the arc before whoever is the mc after yuta im forgetting his name
Okay is it actually that good? My sister also really liked the show and it has some interesting concepts but also like idk
@leowhygamma gimmie ur feet
i needa stress munch
Itâ€™s such a good show
HIS NAME IS JUJUTSU KAISEN
What kind of show is it?
Shit title card, amazing anime despite it
chew on ur big toe
nom
romance but also drama/sci-fi
itadori yuji
leo is once again spreading the bunny girl senpai propaganda
as he should
ITS A GOOD SHOW LMAO
UR FEET ARE A GOOD SHOW
you know what also involves psychology time travel and paradoxes
Psychology, paradoxes, and death sound cool, but waifus not so much
Your mother
Pride and Prejudice
hit donghua link click

huh, yknow what else involves all of this but does not sexualize women? OMNISCIENT READER'S VIEWPOINT
Your feet
GO READ IT PEOPLE
TRUE
Itâ€™s more like a side note, the waifus bit is honestly a joke imo which is great, plus the romance isnâ€™t an interference in the show
is there yuri
ORV>>>>>>>

ok
(I guessed)
yay

B I think
ok tyy
That was what i got too (i guessed)
it's over
I zoned out when he was speaking lol
I think it helps to start with the first equation and producing CH4, then just cancel out whatever you can (intermediate products like H2)
by like subtracting and adding stuff like algebra?
do you reverse it?
Yeah
@snsc tell the skibidi to unblocc
This is what I did
The first one you can reverse
I see
Then, to cancel out the HCl on the products side, reverse the 2nd equation and multiply it by 4
Also oh god fly me to the moon is going thru my head
and let me play amongus stars
My mental capacity is actually shot
ohhh
pedal orgasms can do that
Fly me thru the moon
Lemme play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
Jupiter and mars
In other words
Hold my hand 🎶🎶🎶
bet
Then you just use the 3rd one unchanged, and the CH4 and H2 will cancel out
in other words...
please be trueee
💀
This is my brain rn
if we multiply an equation do multiply the enthalpy as well?
Then you get C + 2Cl -> CCl4 if I did that correctly
Yes
ohhh
you are a genius 🙏
SKIBIDI GYATT RIZZLER ALERT
Since the enthalpy of formation is for 1 mol reaction, if we do 4 mols reaction we will have 4 times the enthalpy of formation essentially
that makes sense
After class please get a good meal and some rest

360(?) grams of caffeine and no breakfast does not sound good

look ma i did a chemistry
caffeine merely increases glucose assimilation in tissues
meaning that glucose is rapidly absorbed
meaning you'll feel hungrier quicker
especially with a diet mtn dew
meaning my blood sugar prolly just low lol
THEN EAT

calm ur tats
i'm gonna have lunch

Perhaps consider bringing a snack
Usually I only have a slice of bread before class for breakfast, so eating in between classes helps
why
so you have a choice
and you just choose a slice of bread
lmao
dunkin is right on the way and easy to grab a breakfast sandwich/donut at
yeah i'll just casually absorb it via osmosis
👍
alternatively plum has good breakfast sandwiches and the only fresh yogurt on campus (when they have it), and if you order when you wake up itll be ready once you get there
what
typically youd eat it
like youre walking through tink you take an extra 30 sec to swipe your card and grab a food and you can eat in class or between classes or whatever

yep
crazy
started from dressrosa in march and finished mid august
I was crazy once
they locked me in a room
a rubber room with rats
and rats make me go crazy
you cannot escape the insanity
just accept it
bc i do regularly start one piece from the beginning like every year or so with my family and then we all fall off at dressrosa
I hear pacing is miserable there
if i can carve out time from finishing tower of god
don't worry
i will consider it
Im rewatching my entire MAL
currently rewatching demon slayer
currently in the entertainment arc of it too
Good intro
And outro actually

Hello Emma!
hi clarisse

how many tabs ;-; jesus
There's quite a bit more than that
lo leo
How do I check 💀
hello jonah
yay
my score dropped because i'm a degenerate
good question
google search it
or bing it

Um
A lot

about 4gb...

Only 50% memory? Weak
My Lenovo Yoga would usually run at 70+%
i have 32gb
Oh nice
if i shut some stuff down it'd prob go down by quite a bit
Try jspaint online
I'll def check that out, thank you
@katsukurry_32009 comfort me pls
Itâ€™s just a practice
yes i'm proud of the score nd whatnot but the 123 CARS is scaring me
i'm going into the world with a limited ability to read
😦
it's 32nd percentile
below average
I see
Well itâ€™s a practice, no? And practices like this exist to help you understand where and how you can improve
Well surely there exist ways of improving it
It's okay, it's just a practice
arnav youâ€™re a first semester freshman
you have so much time
Precisely
So don't worry about the score right now, you're quite literally only at the beginning of college
Just take a deep breath, and look at what needs to be done today, not for two years from now
Plus, youâ€™ve already done more than most people at this stage, so thereâ€™s no way youâ€™re behind now
Exactly
a 505 on first take as a first semester freshman is crazy good, like that's unreal
Also 3rd parties tend to deflate scores too
Leutner got hit by the fire alarm bandit
im fairly confident with everything else
like it sorta makes sense but you have to keep on flipping between the real spheres and gaussian (or what i like to call the "my rules, idgaf about what reality is" sphere)
also god dammit i swear my O2 levels better not be slowly falling ;-;
i have an oximeter lol
I have abandonment issues lol

mods dont ban me ||I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as OSU, is in fact, osu!. The game has an all-lowercase name, mirroring its creator Dean "peppy" Herbert's habit of avoiding capital letters online. In a similar vein, many components of the game and related projects also have lowercase names, such as pp, the four gamemodes (osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania), and lazer. Due to many people habitually capitalizing the first letters of given names and being unfamiliar with names containing punctuation, this game is often incorrectly called "Osu!", "Osu", or even "OSU!". There really is an Osu! - the name is an abbreviation of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, a rhythm game for Nintendo DS that inspired peppy to make osu!. The circle clicking game people know today is osu!, with three lowercase letters and an exclamation mark.||
what in the hap in the fuckening copypasta is this lmao
@leowhygamma shall i get a coof
coffee
mods
modssss /j
ive been at case for too long i see osu and think of ohio state not the game 💀
based
https://tenor.com/view/low-tier-god-meme-mods-gif-14385308006689816010
i see osu and it's either the rhythm game or oklahoma state university for me
@leowhygamma should i disappoint the psychologist or shall i keep her happy with me
to coffee
disappoint
or to not coffee
I think of Oregon State University 😭
so coffee
ok
bet
why are there so many OSU's
but whyyy
she actually seems so happy when i only had two

I think he'd have an actual withdrawal if he did that
might even meal swipe me a coffee

Are we not assuming standard deviations
A bell curve is by definition symmetric but yes the distribution of scores may not be normal

im probably gonna do smth in the humanities so
Is it 145 for you next?
Yep
Just dont do stem, just join the humanities hype train!!!
But i love my math major
I thought cs skipped 145
Yep
Ohhhhh
Iâ€™m doing music too
The most musical i get is glee club
We are performing tonight at harkness chapel btw, 7:30, come see me all spiffed up in a suit
Iâ€™m the coolest baritone with bright red hair !!
ive heard to take 145 in the fall cuz the teacher is better
C4????
Yeah Iâ€™ve heard from Alex too
Itâ€™s either ECSC 132 next semester for me or that
Same
Ooh
Maybe Iâ€™ll do that then
Whatâ€™s MUDE?
Eurhythmics
Iâ€™ve heard thatâ€™s a fun class
But mainly fun
https://tenor.com/view/kiryu-yakuza-dance-cook-gif-12807151538300548832
Itâ€™s not easy easy if you have no sense of musicality but itâ€™s def fun for music majors
Lowkey this is kinda what itâ€™s like
exactly
Most recent midterm involved like a 12 measure 4/4 canon, microbeats going from 1 subdivision per beat to 9 back to 1, and singing in a way we get 6 bpm exact
Yes
What do you use for septuplet?
Like wording
Di-ga-Di-ga-Di-ga-na
Oh Iâ€™m from Jersey so I say rut-gers-u-ni-ver-si-ty
It varies from professor to professor
And 5-let is hippopotamus
the idea in eurhythmics here is you generally divide into 3s and 2s
Yup
Oooh
It stays more consistent when doing music too when you have to do some weird stuff in rhythms
also the more consistent and neutral syllables help with this
(Example: I have a 22 note run in my concerto and there is no way in hell Iâ€™m opening the dictionary to look for one that could do 22 syllables lmao)
Yup
it also makes it way easier to figure out polyrhythms later
for stuff you are not necessarily taught
Agreed
My teachers always split runs into 3s and 2s (or 4s if theyâ€™re long runs)
it gets weird with vocal stuff sometimes because of phrasing and how the breath works
https://youtu.be/iAGRRdjOy6A
i had to do this piece last semester a bit faster than this recording, the bass like at 0:43 gets subdivided into 5 and 3 when you take it faster
if youre bored try solving #3 and #4 using the definition of derivative (f'(x) = f(x-h)-f(x) / h)
and show me the step by step process
God no
U sub
3. Id make U=2x+1 and then start going from there
4. Iâ€™d flip it so itâ€™s (x-1)^-2 and also u sub
Ah, I see 😔
i said using limit definition not u substitution 💀
They run 9:30-10:20 MWF in spring
Wait is it x - h or x + h

Butler calculated 3
I'll calculate 4 later
x-h
wait
WAIT
yeah it's x+h
tysmm
Thank Butler not me lol
Thatâ€™s okay, I do that a lot
oh wait does he post the solutions to his website?
Only whatever people ask in class
oh ok
Wait there are solutions mb
nah not hw it's review
I see
Wait are you also in 121?
yeah
Ohh okay, makes sense
this reminds me, if anyone has data structures questions after 9pm tonight i can help with them

imagine not trying to make a lightbulb in 4th grade and thinking all electricity was the same
and proceed to put wires into the wall socket instead of attaching it to a 9v battery
indirectly committing socket fork
it's illegal to take it off the wall after 4 months
fun fiziks thing
u can grab the terminals of a car battery just fine
okay thing is the wires were already connected to metal paper clips which held a graphite filament to act as a filament that could act as the part that lights up
people get paranoid but its perfectly saft
makes sense
I mean I wouldnâ€™t recommend it
there is a video of a guy with jumper cables clipped to his balls which he then connects to a car battery
i want to see that video
its like 12 volts

Care to elaborate on what?
holy fuck lmao i started a tension problem about random strings and this came on
Itâ€™s a hint
Replying to this again because im so confused
solubility rule plus H+ rule thing for reactions
if compounds contain insoluble thingies from the solubility rule then it's solid
if not, it's aqeuous (unless it is water which should be liquid)
good question
i'll look at it thursday afternoon
Whatâ€™s the best way to get to brb for morning lab
In cokked
you can go straight from nrv to euclid and then turn up cornell
Is there something you wanna say?
"skibidi"
#not-english

insightful thoughts @dream.9446
😐
butler approves
mpe flashbacks
"skibidi" - butler 2024
"i'll take my skibidi" - hozier
It canâ€™t be said Iâ€™m an early bird
Itâ€™s ten oâ€™clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you donâ€™t gotta pretend, baby, now and then

Donâ€™t you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake?
Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If youâ€™re drunk on life, babe, I think itâ€™s great
But while in this world

I think Iâ€™ll take my skibidi
My coffee black and my bed at three
Youâ€™re too sweet for me
Youâ€™re too sweet for me

I take my skibidi
My coffee black and my bed at three
Youâ€™re too sweet for me
Youâ€™re too sweet for me

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I aim low
I aim true and the groundâ€™s where I go
I work late where Iâ€™m free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know

But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if itâ€™s Heavenâ€™s gate
The rest of you like youâ€™re the TSA
I wish I could go along, babe, donâ€™t get me wrong

You know youâ€™re bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe Iâ€™ll wait
Until that day

Iâ€™d rather take my skibidi
My coffee black and my bed at three
Youâ€™re too sweet for me
Youâ€™re too sweet for me

I take my skibidi
My coffee black and my bed at three
Youâ€™re too sweet for me
Youâ€™re too sweet for me

Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh

I take my skibidi
My coffee black and my bed at three
Youâ€™re too sweet for me
Youâ€™re too sweet for me
I bid you luck this physics is tough

Anyone know how to do number 1 & 2 on the chem practice test?
nvm i know 1 now not 2
Can you share it here?
YES
WE'RE 100% GOLDEN FOR THAT CHEM TEST
IT WAS JUST PHYSICS
WE LIKE PHYSICS
@whywouldibearnav Your id is in leutner
yes i know ty lol
my ADHD riddled ass might have just dropped it
I am so happy with how well that chem test went
the teacher: you're done..? we're only 3 minutes in
me: yup! *he looks at my answers for a long time* woah nice
for the actual chem test, quite cooked
but for today's discussion test
not cooked at all
Nice!
i genuinely love physics but despise chemistry for whatever reason
it's like that one meme
I am not familiar with this meme

for you right
top is english
middle is chemistry
Although todays quiz was great
it was just physics right
Is it just basic PV=nRt
it's legit just physics
Bro wdym
no chemicals
sure
It really was just a physics problem tbh
Oh lmao just plug and chug
i screamed in a girly way and said "PHYSICS!!!!!" with genuine excitement
i love physics
There was like no chemistry whatsoever?
The quiz is gas laws which is like chem
Wtballs
when
you just be needed to know the units for MM
what time works for you
any time honestly
4?
i'm free after 2:30
lol
same
honestly just lmk when you go to ksl and i'll head over
I am so happy dude
That chem test released happy chemicals in my brain

Wait is it raining?
Also not really an issue im at leutner rn and have my umbrella
Iâ€™m heading to clarke now anyways
alright thank you so much lmao
Are you coming down or?
no (yes but no but yes)
Larger is solvent, smaller is solute, so ethanol has to be the solvent because its 151/2 % made of ethanol
hello again I am once again asking what does this say?
to the right
"(Aeal reason is bonds in are in resonance)"
Real reason
and is there just a typo in the second half?
i'm not even sure what "in resonance" means
the bond is in a resonance structure i beleive
no clue 💀
oh ur good 💀
So these structures are resonance structures
ohh
another question: why does it say "2-Butanol"?
what does the 2 mean
I think it means the O is attached to the second carbon? I'm not quite sure
That's an ochem thing for sure tho
Wait nvm I am completely off

ty
I am guessing that it is because the hydroxy group is on the 2nd carbon
ok ty
Yeah okay it's because the OH is at position 2
Np
bruh some of the questions of the practice test is different than the ones on the answer key
💀
yeah they're not the same test
If you calculate the urms for O2, you get 472m/s
Keep in mind that the molar mass used in the bottom of the fraction is kg/mol
ohhh that might be it, ty
Also Emma if I may ask how are you studying for CS?
Wait what are the reaction types we need to know??
Precipitation, acid-base, redox
Assuming same as 105
Precipitation: (aq) + (aq) -> (aq) + (s)

Acid-base: H+ transferred

Redox: oxidation states change
Additional tip: when writing out net ionic reactions for weak acids make sure to keep all the ions from the weak acid
oh I'm gonna cram tmrw during my lunch period, right b4 the test
Ah okay
Know the rules about oxidation states
cool
Such as oxygen is always -2, hydrogen is always +1, etc
And neutral particles have net oxidation state of 0
hope this can help
that's a very long acronym for a very simple concept
drew meyer
Or LeO says GeR
only 6 letters :p
yes and two of those letters are "is"
there's surely a more efficient method to convey that information memorably
idk it works fine for me
Oxidation states
ty
All halogen are usually -1
But Fluorine is always -1
Say it.
No
Iâ€™m gonna go get drenched in some recycled dinosaur piss brb
alright I think I'm good
I hope
Good luck to everyone taking an exam this week! Especially you chem 111 folks. You got this :)
Me whoâ€™s in chem 105:
grrrr
Can someone explain this to me? Thanks T-T
Nvm I think I get it now
I'm confused, why are the answers for a and b both positive???
Depends, what is he doing?
the equation got 
flipped
But then if we're breaking NO2, why would the enthalpy of formation be +68?
why is it pressure
what
A balloon has to have equal pressure to the outside to maintain its shape
ohhh right
Actually according to Meyer, "balloon expands until pressure in matches external pressure"
The equation on the actual practice test is making no2 not breaking it
Ah okay
Ty
remember the ideal gas law, everyone:

â€œpimb vectam cots tratâ€

(pressure is multiplied by volume, equaling closely the amount moles compose of the substance times r and temperature)

God is good
I could barely do the practice sheet from the review
we love to hear it

But your energy TSA, checking everything, pls
I could follow, but the rizz too weak, honestly.

Uâ€™re bright like the sun, but I move in the dark

If u tryna sit in that basic lane, Iâ€™ll park
But for now, Iâ€™m sayinâ€™â€¦

Skibidi with no regrets
3 AM hit, coffee on deck
U too sweet, Iâ€™m a different set
Too sweet for me, so no effect.

Whoa, oh-oh

This is pm right??

How far into the evening do your classes go???
so 5:45
yeah
wait why do these schedules sound so nice
I finished, which is a major improvement in itself
You can schedule them yourself!! Just make sure you're right on time as soon as class registration itself opens
iâ€™d love to see one so ik what to expect spring
yes
it works
OH THANK TOD
GOD
i thought i was gonna end up like my friends with premade schedules
Nah
well yes but most freshman classes such as the legendary chem 111 only have one time slot
True that
so if you're doing calc 2 like me you have to get up at 7:30 every monday wednesday friday
exactly how do you live
do you have breaks at least?

basically if you're STEM, you have his class at least once if you're not testing out with AP chemistry
Yep
imagine being stem
losers
Wht was your physics teacher like?
uhhhh
:(
imagine not gigachadding with music and STEM
tf is a midtermâ€¼ï¸
a term but mid
Imagine not being part of the chem 111 gang (and 105 for Kyle)
https://tenor.com/view/bocchi-bocchi-the-rock-lowpoly-model-3d-gif-27300477
they studied inelastic collisions
arnav please
maybe don't traumatize the new people
MODS

Chem 111 (and Kyle)
No because Arnav you're right, sleep is important, so go to bed
btw asides from arnav, I'm like the second craziest person here tbh in my humble and completely unbias opinion
And the rest of us should also go to bed
I would consider myself normal by this servers standards
Yeah lol
Listen I need to lock in for chem
which is 15% done lmao
😭
nah
Gl Leo o7
we not locking in

WHAT
WHAT
L
mods get this guy out of here
mods take care of him.
You should help me calculated 6 values of kinetic energy and 6 values of momentum please Leo please please please
i could do that
KE=(1/2)(m)(v^2)
Yeah why tf do you have that one pic on your phone?
and momentum = mass times velocity
you're welcome
it's like barely decent
I swear I have talked to you once

as opposed to this?
Banana Fish
?
I think that was you at least
https://tenor.com/view/sponge-bob-patrick-star-thinking-hmmm-intense-gif-5454670
lol
id send something even more diabolical
but iâ€™d get maybe kicked
i dont remember talking about banana fish with anyone recently
dms it is
there is also another muhsin on the campus
which is why i have both initials of my last name now
wait what instrument do you play
well at least it's not the 17 alex's

i have a sleep schedule stereotypical of a CS/engineer
https://tenor.com/view/gintama-gintoki-gif-23945774
will be oversleeping the instant i get home to compensate
Idk if that's healthy necessarily but whatever, I'm not any better
i could also attempt a reset
this is for sure making me feel prepared to live by myself
I make decisions like I'm a 10 year old playing minecraft
problem is that i already am 😭
well its over for me!
That's probably why I'm unwise
same
No it's not
Let's all go sleep now
indeed
😭
i will

The photos on the other hand
Well

what the ADHD
It's not easy having 11,409 photos and 187 videos

clarisse has more messages stored than the size of wikipedia
how many people do you text

Listen I like photos and my concert videos
And gacha gambling
i put it housing apps on the 7th of november
?
what games do you play

im in it
and also it's very loud sometimes
Rn just Project Sekai and Honkai Star Rail?
leo says grr?
also facilities are kinda mediocre and rooms are small
my friends got me hooked on wuthering waves and thatâ€™s it
yeah
You should donate some storage
will and shall avoid
i do play terraria and genshin
i have gotten desperate on occasions
i like
haven't had time for genshin in a good bit
No
clarisse have people sent what i call video bombs to you

Lmao imagine playing Genshin and not getting banned from it by your parents
clarisse touches grass or is terminally online
finish games i havent played
kekw
it's just like massive video files
just sent to you
Maybe? I know my friend's brother used to make vlogs and she would send the video to it
Who is the baby 💀
that's prob why
don't ask the babybrain question
there is no amount of context that could possibly explain this
don't ask
mods
Just checked and I deleted them, largest video sent was 859.9MB
:O
how
the more questions you ask about arnav the more you pull on the thread that makes up the ugly sweater known as arnav
Case gives us 100GB of storage after all
basically meyer railed butler
and had a baby
MODS
arnav please
GET HIM OUT OF HERE
https://tenor.com/view/stfu-gif-6401003389838608981

I mean he's pretty knowledgeable on many things science, but also he is very well-versed in brainrot
that's why i said ugly sweater
utility is there, but fashion choice is negative
yeah, AIQS can do that
Arnav is your name "leo says grr" 💀
i speak with smtg akin to on the fly weirdness
Yeah how are they dividing up the topics anyway?
@whywouldibearnav have you ever wondered to yourself if time was a construct and when the dog jumped over the moon into saturday, you sprung up mid july out of bed, trick or treating, while at christmas dinner with your family at the graveyard, take that in for a second and see the cat wearing your boots, getting it down like his name is taylor swift, and since you shake it off, try and understand that work is calling your name and theyâ€™re asking why your waffles are made out of shoes? thatâ€™s right, you need to sleep
https://tenor.com/view/bocchi-bocchi-the-rock-non-linear-gif-27023528
i love bullshitting in class
this is gonna be me with AIQS
tis my favorite activity
Real
That could be fun actually

aiqs?
https://tenor.com/view/elf-nonsense-elf-frieren-frieren-beyond-journey%27s-end-sousou-no-frieren-gif-2308403050531304831
us in AIQS
Basically required writing class
i ended up in the same AIQS as my name twin
ohhhhhhh
That's quite the coincidence
meyer inserts some special chemicals into into butler's derivative 🤤
it's some sort of mandatory writing class
alright get out
we are also on the same floor of taft
some people have it this semester, some have it in the sprung semester
its comedic
That is quite incredible Muhsin
@leowhygamma how do you live in the same dorm as arnav
i live in clarke
he's in raymond
Imagine living in a dorm
where do you live
shut up commuter
lmao
its a very interesting experience
WHAT
Home lol
so youâ€™re telling me
you live in OHIO
Yeah
ohhhhh
CS stands for multiple things
Yeah
meyer integrated all over butler and out came kyle
if you look in my profile, CS is not comp sci
arnav go to bed
CARLOS SAINZ MENTIONED
Yeah it's your gf's initials right?
https://tenor.com/view/bongocat-banhammer-ban-hammer-bongo-gif-18219363
yup
how wholesome
That's quite sweet
Arnav respectfully please stop
sometimes its not our turn to speak
if arnav was in japan he'd be arrested
Kyle you're back please help
Same
KYLE
PLEASE
STOPPP
kyle please make arnav sleep
I used desmos, just put in the equations and change the set values for m and v. matlab also works. maybe I should've just used that. lmao.
Look at Arnav's server profile
mods can we use chloroform
just this once
mods remove one electron from arnav
add 7 neutrons to every atom in arnav
redox
mods hit arnav with a comically large clown cartoon hammer that magically fits in my pocket
https://cdn.weeb.sh/images/H16aQJFvb.gif

https://tenor.com/view/low-tier-god-meme-mods-gif-13608578677877456774
oxidize
acid-base arnav's ass
precipitation reaction arnav
Mods, make all of his bodily acids donate 1 proton
mods throw arnav into the nearest bunsen burner
ima use my hobby chem research
splash some triethylborane
Ooo hobby chem research? Please elaborate
mods impale arnav with a test tube rack
can you make meth
meyer uses his chemistry knowledge weekend 😏
exactly **how**
having the idle thought "what if dragon spit two streams of hyperbolic propellants at each other. biological rocket engine."
ah nvm then
Mods, send arnav to strosacker purgatory
baby mutler aka kyle
with some consultation remembered that pyrophorics are a thing and work better for that
TEB is used to ignite rocket engines
yeh tis bedtime
mods, send arnav to mesocosm hell
Interesting, I will look into this
mods, send arnav to the if i have no mouth i must scream canon
i can one up you, i set my lab on fire
At least it was only one day
good thing is, i got a free repair cuz they thought it was a screen defect
Ooo nice
lmao
What did you do 💀
mods, manifest this onto arnav but make it forever
meyer drops a 1 gram weight
chemical explosion
i mix too many things
and uh
blew up a beaker
which transforms into an 8 lb weight
and it caused the curtains to set on fire
no :(
good night all
gn mate
My favorite thing is someone telling me about how they got the lysing buffer(?) in their eye and then saying it was fine because it was only red for two days

how about the USS kitty hawk
right
;-;
it was such a magnificent giant of the skies
good night
I am under your bed, do not check and do not fear
be not afraid @dream.9446

itâ€™s time for yall to hit the sack because you are all genuinely, one may say, **tweaking**
just like butler is constantly under meyer..?
that includes you arnav
*especially arnav
arnav when i get there in the spring
this is a test: name the vehicle sitting atop the antonov-225
iâ€™m coming for you
yeah i hope i dream of butler hitting meyer's "OKAYYYYYYY"
it's the soviet version of the space shuttle right
Gn, no dreams for you
iâ€™m already planning arnavs demise
a very delightful experience
I have a bamboo sword
just in my room
Oh yeah kendo right?
yup
butler would absolutely *kill* it in bed
shinai
Nice
going once? going twice?
Cool little plane?
would you like the yuri treatment from DDLC
iâ€™ll just tape him to the ceiling
"little" 😭
That's the strange thing tho, he's been intaking less caffeine
wait
theoretically
what if we dose him with more
I mean it IS a bit littler than the space shuttle
NO
We are not overdosing anyone okay
🤓  um actually hypothetically is the correct word here
the answer is buran.
I'm doing an overdose bit in front of my RA
What 💀
Impossible
it's amazing how many things like "oh yeah the soviets built a space shuttle" most people probably don't know.
i filled up an entire bottle that originally had some decongestant meds that i took corrrectly, cleaned multiple times, and currently filled with water
im gonna drink it in front of my RA whenever I know she sees me
or he will go into actual withdrawal
Reef, during one of my first encounters with Arnav I found out he had 7 mountain dews, 3 coffees, and 3 energy drinks in one day
HE DID WHAT
That is really cool
oh yeah he did tell us that
I think so?
average day of arnav is insanity
it was a special occasion
usually i have none
i legit almost made my "therapist" slap me one day 💀 i was so thankful i had a physics lab
also arnav for the love of god please change your name back before one of the mods hunts you down
Do you see now?
i wonder what goes on in that head of his
Wait wdym?
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1149078132901564590/1222401220744970320/crab_fry.gif

i'll dm you what i sent her
iâ€™ll take the fall and dorm with him to make sure he doesnâ€™t overdose on caffeine
what i had that one fateful day
4 mtn dews
4 rockstar energies
1/2 a max size coffee

^

Precisely
oh boy
GET OUT
Shut
I am so sorry for this first impression of your future classmates Reef

Do you wear contacts?
nah
i have rly good vision
Hey at least I don't have to be chained to the campus
I'm happy for you but dangit (me with glasses)
being chained to campus is great actually
Prometheus style
any volunteers?
L
Both of us with glasses 😔
😔
I can actually kinda increase my vision too almost on command
similar to my blood pressure
???
zoom in feature
i've done it before
Thatâ€™s Leoâ€™s quirk
That's pretty cool actually
arnav literally was taking my pulse and then i just started raising it on command
Woah that's super neat
You should donate some of that vision and height to me
nah
donate the vision to me
iâ€™m begging
-13 is getting to me
im proud for being tall as a japanese person
how tall?
As tall as a Japanese person
Duh
💀
Bruh I have family friends who are also filipino/chinese and they're like a foot taller than me
5'5
Good morning Alex
according to my DL
itâ€™s chem 1 am time
Good morning Clarisse
hello 1 out of 17 legally named alex's
If that's the case you should donate some of your height please
20*
i got 3 inches to spare
***that's what she said***
Ty 🥹
Now I can be taller than Leo ha
so itâ€™s a win for me either way
chem 111 midterm is over man
Every time is chem 111 time
I can rest
rev up the chainsaw and that can be fixed
Go rest, you deserve it!
Be careful, Drew Meyer might give you a clicker question
CLICKERQUESTIONGO!!
atp i canâ€™t wait to take chem class because this seems exciting
I mean chem is...fine
is it:
a) sodium
b) bromine
c) carbon
d) electron
e) hessâ€™ law
There are no labs or anything like that that you get to do in 111 at least
f) resonance structures
0_o
Yes.
hint: the question is â€œwhoâ€™s that pokÃ©monâ€
Drawing structures = fun, photoelectron spectroscopy or something like that = not fun
You're so right tbh
I will fr
Gm
i think that applies for the rest of you matriculated college students
gn yall
anyways imma sign off
itâ€™s chase atlantic time
Nah
Lmao
OH! I KNOW!!!

also i think arnav got noscoped by a mod
*is not surprised*
Arnav has been removed from the server for repeated rules violations, including repeatedly posting explicit content that should not be in this server.
yeah makes sense, like i said, not surprised
I will add that this was a team decision and not just one person. We felt like we gave him ample chances and time to refrain from posting this content.
Sometimes the job just has to be done
also hey @mism0937 are you heading to carlton rn
Nah
whymst
it's only 25:38
or -23:38
You made me pause a bit with that first time
-22:22
which now that you think is kinda crazy
Interesting
like that's wild to think about, especially for a place that small that gets multiple rushes even within that time frame
No wonder theyâ€™re always backed up
there's always weird chaos going on
plus a new spring semester person is gonna be thrown into what i'd call a hodgepodge of actual chaos
also i did not just write 6 = 4 on my paper like a dumbass lmao
nah
im gonna cook
(aka i burn to hell like I'm hellmo)
Sleep
i have 8 more questions

One upping you, Iâ€™m on 3.5
will be napping later today its fine
Okay, that's good

And when I mean giant, theyâ€™re like bigger than most peopleâ€™s hands
Iâ€™m not joking either lmao
One of those is arnavâ€™s
too many options
"Skibidi toilet rizz"?

@leowhygamma iâ€™d feel youâ€™d know the answer to this question but is there good matcha or boba around campus 🙏
No clue
å›ã®åã¯spotted
honestly this movie is what got me into anime
back in 2020
wait no it wasnâ€™t this movie
it was the 2nd movie
the first was 5 centimeters per second
oh boy
had to restart it
also for anime I will always recommend Rascal Does Not Dream of a Bunny Girl Senpai
it's so good and peak anime imo
thatâ€™s so real
my first set would either be your name, horimiya, or cyberpunk edgerunners
I can dm you my MAL
Iâ€™m going to drink from the lagoon
nah nah consider the fribley jungle juice
ooh thatâ€™s chill
why is our taste in anime super similar
sned me afriend request I'll accept it later lol
i forgor log in
theres a boba place that takes meal swipes on campus
its solid
sweet spot is also decent but money
thank you
might do so today since im in veale rn
like anything will do
we could meet up per chance
i have lab at 5:30 today so ;-;
â˜¹ï¸
i need to nap after shoulder rehab anyways actually
then gym time
adventure meaning how far in terms of miles
i know a fast walking pace is like 20 minutes from freshman dorms to the southside (aka the sophomore dorms)
but it takes like a 30ish min walk if you are doing it casually
Phusion cafe on Euclid takes case cash and is pretty good
Taiwanese food
Indian flame is the other Asian food option that takes case cash
time to starve the second half of sem
(tragically no japanese but A) japanese food in america is a luxury and B) it's so mid for the price)
Iâ€™m coming to the 7th floor

cali has good asian food
oh god
wait hol up
whattttttt
gimme those fucking dumplings lmao
uhhhh
$6?
actually correct
theyâ€™re pork and chives
you can get them pan fried or steamed
Tippit tea my beloved🧋
given the writing
Real
food is just a major bonus for me
This is the first thing im getting when i go home
There are some solid places around Cleveland but not necessarily on campus
what **exactly** is that
Sandwich
i wanna know whatâ€™s in the sandwich
i see cheese and meatballs(?)
Looks like lettuce and chicken to me
Are you also Japanese or (what Asian/non Asian ethnicity if youâ€™re comfortable sharing lol)
bengali
iâ€™m like
3/4 bengali
15% japanese
10% australian
itâ€™s a slightly weird mix
Ooh
Interesting choices of ethnicity /j (not that you had a choice XD)
but thatâ€™s majorly it
Iâ€™m p sure mine would show up almost entirely as Japanese with traces of other ethnicities
or ancestry
see what i truly am
is anyone in phys 123 rn

Phys test tmw
Phys 122 gang gonna be testing tmw
Will you take a break during Fall Break?
Whatâ€™s a break

A period of time devoted to non-working activities, typically rest or recreation
Like these?

Where?
At my house
Done by my hand
Ah
Iâ€™m aware
Friday and Saturday Iâ€™m gonna practice kendo and violin which I am desperate to do
And what about Sunday , Monday, Tuesday?

Ooo what's quizbowl?
Maybe breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide as well
Yo saaame
Hmm cellular respiration is pretty good

Itâ€™s a competition in which you answer trivia based on a series of clues
Interesting

Running sounds lovely
attempt to reset sleep schedule
but i will prob end up playing video games for 4 days
Honestly same
and elden ring run 2 must continue
Is it good? I know a lot of people were playing it when it came out
its solid
scenery is beautiful
story is interesting
inconvenient puzzles
im also just a puzzle hater ever since FF7 rebirth
I fear having to do puzzles once my sister and I get rebirth
most of them are good
but
the boxes.
...boxes?
Yes please

Weird train of thought: the prince from the story Cinderella is weird
canon foot fetish
Maybe that was the real reasonâ€¦
Conclusions: the prince in Cinderella has a foot fetish
https://tenor.com/view/prince-charming-jumping-out-the-window-cinderella-iii-gif-12737669322444678227
The train of thought makes sense
cinderella 3 is peak disney

Thereâ€™s a prince in that one?
Yeah
He kisses Snow White to make her wake up I think
This is the guy
nah best male lead in any disney movie gotta be flynn â€œeugeneâ€ ryder

FLYNN
and heâ€™s sexy
The childrenâ€™s version is â€œrapunzel rapunzel let down your hairâ€
and the best part? he actually knows how to sing
https://tenor.com/view/disney-lanterns-rapunzel-flynn-rider-tangled-gif-14323232

Lowkey not a fan of mice
Crazy?
Like whose mice are those??? Why are they there?
rats? I was rats once. they locked me in a rubber! and room rubber! a room rubber with crazy! crazy makes me rats!
So this implies you like when they scurry around in a square formation
No
Erm actually, a triangle formation 🤓 👆
nah triangle
LMAO
lol
Hexagons
That might be more freaky
Too coordinated
I'd rather scurry in a one dimensional vibrating string
wait can they hypothetically move in a parallel line formation

Can they move to the coordinates -e times the sort of pi - pi*i
maybe, but if its true, they go move into non-euclidian geometry, where parallel lines do intersect
non-euclid ave?
0_0
Itâ€™s the road that bisects campus
Wait so that means non Euclid avenue will bisect the campus multiple times even as a straight line

what would happen if we made euclid avenue non-euclidian

ok
Like the BelugaXL has a good livery
favorite military aircraft?
Hmmmm
Northrop B-2 Spirit
f-14
is just objectively the best
i like the swing wing
has so much sex appeal
Plus Northrop is like a god in the aviation industry for the flying wing concept

No
Just I feel thatâ€™s in the list of things to not make

TRUST ME

IT DOES NOT GET ANY FUN

youâ€™d be perfect for IB then

also you english sl traitor

SL: Comp Sci, Spanish, and ESS
whatâ€™s L&L
A&A technically but it depends if you like stats or calc more, like A&A seemed easier to me because it had more calc than stats
English language and literature
ah
A&I i hated stats
what are those letters
We had tok every other day 😞

Oh yeah it opens at 6

Rly easy
Okay I feel the same but like I definitely messed to the electric field on the first part of 1
It was 0, then -Q/4(pi)(epsilon), then 0, 0 right
Thatâ€™s what I putâ€¦.. maybe I did do it right
Yup!
Well like the E field itself
Oh wait include divided by r^2 lol
Yeah ofc ofc
Okay I could have done very well then
That make me very happy
The test was rly easy
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cute-happy-jumping-gif-26555219
Me rn
If you tried your best to understand the hw and problem sets he put out it should be more than easy to do that test from what I perceive
(Also cuz Gaussian surfaces is rly fun and easy too)
Yessss
I was so happy that I printed them out and did them
I remember doing Gaussian stuff in phys C and loving it
Cuz itâ€™s so intuitive for the most part
And then gave up for the AP
I just understand integrals as the sum under a curve
And failed it 😭
Thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve understood integrals, with derivatives just being slices of a surface
Ah
Yeah understandable
Okay ignore what I said then lmao
@mudrocker
Aka tldr, limit yourself to one bachelor from each field, not more than 2
I mean I know a handful of people in the music program doing a triple degree but I can like count on one hand and they seem like absolute weapons
You can do 3 majors if they're all BA or if 2 of them overlap to extreme degree
But generally 2 majors is challenging enough
Maybe I should pick up marketing /j
was not expecting an actual serious answer but I greatly appreciate it â¤ï¸
(My mental health is gonna be that of the titan if I do that lol)
Happy to help :)
Also completely off topic, what are these like tiny little creatures I see running around on south side of campus every now and then
Like they look like sorta a squirrel and fits in the palm of my hand size
Chipmunk?
What
yeah..
Ainâ€™t no way I just asked what are chipmunks lmao
But yeah picking up a music major would be quite difficult because it requires an audition and is very front loaded. Math and cs is pretty doable. CS + philosophy would be challenging, but doable with cs ba. And cs + math + phil all as BA could be done but may not be fun
R any of yâ€™all staying here for the fall break
CE and music for me is tiring but I find it rewarding (mainly from phys 122 and just music overall being fun so)
Meeee
I know another ce/music person actually. Seems pretty challenging, but if you're willing to take heavy semesters you can do it
Jaeden right?
I see
R u international
Music here is not as hard as when it was in Texas so I find music enjoyable here
Lmao
Insert joke about Texas succession here
Yes
they're so cute 🥺
Yeah the chipmunks are very cute
Anyways time to deactivate all the neurons in my brain and play terraria lol
ah I see, that does make sense
Ikrrr
I also know someone who I think is compe or CS and music ed
I know Benâ€™s doing CS and doing music
*ben K
Yep Ben is my cs music friend
And then I know a guy Chris who is music Ed and some variation of cs or compe
I do not recall which, and it may have changed

Dang
Just make sure you do your research into what you need before you buy
Was thinking we could pool our funds
Mine was 2k ish and Iâ€™m using a framework 16 with the RX 7800S so
Yep, used all 3 of them on chorizo wraps and used the extra cents in them for discounted chorizo wraps LMAO
im thinking 500 is expensive
i love framework and all but thatr price tag scares me
Aw man that would've been nice
$500 is cheap for laptops
I mean itâ€™s mid range laptops and all so
but im banned from taking my setup for my first 2 semesters
They good?
I really like them a lot lol
I've got a smaller appetite, so they're a pretty good size
And the taste is really good
Plus it's warm so it's nice since it's getting colder
?
If you use one of the gift cards it'll be free, and then you'll have like 21 extra cents for something else
The boba if you come along
where are these wraps?
Dunkin
is that a swipe option?
I see
Maybe I will try one 🤔
i lwkey wanna get a secondhand or cheap laptop to run linux on to learn it
For some things, yes
If Alan buys me a m.2 2230 I will use Linux
Itâ€™s jolly swipes btw
For the chorizo specifically, no
icic
whats that...
An SSD size standard
whats so special about it
I begged my roommate to swipe me boba
I can and so I can clown on you

Yes
Omg thatâ€™s so great

This is not fascinating;-;;;;;
the bead is BULGING the port ever so slightly that it's making it super tight

I think your best bet at this point might be scraping it out
it's jammed in there
Maybe try pressing up and then trying to scrape it?
did you try putting it in rice
Assuming the roof is flexible
does anyone have a heat gun
;-;
Did you try turning it off and on again?
maybe i could melt the silica bead
I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a good idea
no
or maybe like a can of air they use on keyboards))
not ones that are skinny enough
I have an ear scooper in my dorm

finished watching
FELLOW KSP PLAYER??
fellow ksp player?!?
around 30 hours
most of them have been messing around with planes
planes are my weak suit by far lol
that right there is the very first ssto I've built that made it to orbit on the absolute first try
wowww thats super cool
ive only managed very basic orbits
it takes time
I've been playing for about a year now
oh dang nice
rn I'm launching this brand new fuel shuttle I built from my fuel refinery up to the orbital dockyard
then the dockyard'll be at full capacity
orbital dockyard
wowwwww
are you running stock ksp or with mods?
modded
oh nice
the important ones here are stockalike space station parts, near future technologies suite, and simple construction
simple construction basically lets me use any docking ports to build crafts out of rocket parts refined from stock ore
itâ€™s pretty great
the ssto parts come from the mods mk2 expansion and mk3 expansion which add more parts with the stock spaceplane shapes, and mk4 spaceplane mod which adds a bigger scale of them
ooo
ive only messes around with the armory mods??
bdarmory is fun yeah
a bit overwhelming to me though lol
yeah fr the menus are quite extensive
but it was pretty cool how well you could get dogfights going within KSP
yeah
the near future tech suite has gotta be my favorite mod. mods. itâ€™s got a whole lot of fun stuff. and the same mod creator made mk4 spaceplanes and the space station parts, and theyâ€™re all compatible with freeiva.
oh wow, what does it have?
near future tech is a lot of different mods, which come with 7m fuel tanks, lots of new command modules, tons of big solar panels, comms parts, giant probe cores
Which part?
oooo
I forget if itâ€™s a dependency or just recommended but I also use the cryo engines mod which adds methane and hydrogen engines including raptor analogues.
oh and thereâ€™s near future aviation which adds massive 2.5m jet engines
I KNOW
Ah that one
I can help you with that
like i get what it is
I remember spending a significant amount of time just building the most massive planes I could in stock KSP
and the far future tech mod which also comes from the same guy adds a bunch of hypothetical nuclear and antimatter engines
Come outside and Iâ€™ll help you @leowhygamma
nah
K
ohhhh nice
I'll have to check out these mods after I get the hang of stock
yeah thatâ€™s what I did. I spent so long just on stock
but near future is a good place to start
thank you for coming to my TED talk lmao
Elaboration please

Why?

Ok true

in the deepest of seas
i am losing my mind
Lol I can explain HvZ but it's not because I'm in Greek life
HvZ is a campus wide game of 24/7 infection tag, where the zombies tag humans to turn them into zombies. We do all sorts of fun quests and missions throughout the game and you can use a nerf blaster and socks to stun zombies and defend yourself as a human. You're also safe indoors
wait
that sounds
so fun
Wait is it held every semester or only during the fall semesters
Every semester
This semesters game started about 11 minutes ago
Did you just @ yourself?
ah so youâ€™re only vulnerable outside
the way iâ€™d bake in my room while having a nerf sniper rifle to shoot people outside would go crazy
Pretty much, but you're also safe at crosswalks for example
ah dammit
alright alright
iâ€™ll think about what i could do to circumnavigate that
How do they monitor like everything
yes
hang out a window so youâ€™re technically outside
i was thinking that
https://tenor.com/view/y3ongi-gun-peter-griffin-gif-21033967
We expect people to play in good faith. If you violate the rules you get infractions, which can lead to being kicked from the game entirely
I wonder if Iâ€™m allowed to change the firing noise of the blaster to be more cringe
what if i perch onto a roof
camouflage myself over night
and when itâ€™s day
snipe everyone
Several of those things are banned in the game
dammit
But save your questions for when you're actually playing next semester :)
https://tenor.com/view/happy-to-sad-face-silly-sad-mood-switch-computer-gif-1609533414975318099
just go to the rules meetings and you'll see what i'm talking avbout lol
okay okay
The number of rules theyâ€™ve had to make about socks is crazy lmao
socks?????
â€œSock has to be made out of 100% sockâ€
"socks must be entirely sock"
You can throw balled up socks to stun zombies
^^ this is the budget-friendly alternative to nerf darts
I AGREE
If you would like to submit a modification to a blaster you can do so through our discord bot
but otherwise if they approve then it's fine
Nice so I can

does music help?
maybe
Those are two relatively calming songs
telephones by vacations

lights are on by tom rosenthal
coffee by beabadoobee
love. by wave to earth
(itâ€™s in full korean but the beat is soothing)
dude omg 🥲🥲
fellow w2e fan?
indeed i am
yippeee
fav w2e song?
lowkey love is up there

oooh okay

LILY OF THE VALLEY 😭
iâ€™d add more but i donâ€™t wanna scroll through my 1000 song playlist
uhhhhhh
stuff did NOT go well for me since July
so real 😭😭
I've sobbed so many times to that song
but it's comforting in a way
itâ€™s comforting solitude
mhm
and love wins all 🥲🥲
i usually just put an airpod in one ear at minimum value and wait till i get so stress free that im too tired to put it back into the case beside my pillow
uhhhhhhhhhâ€¦ yes
oceans and engines by niki will be a favorite for you then
ooo oki
Socks rule btw @reefrider
oh my god the cyberpunk song 😭😭
and no leo do NOT ABBREVIATE THAT
i played the game since day 0
and have modded it to beyond hell
(yes i zeroed smasher with rebeccaâ€™s shotgun)
jfjekekebkdod my roomie came back
this is driving me insane
airpod noise cancellation?
or maybe go for like a 10 minute quick walk
Time to lagoon max ig
perhaps but my headphones r too bulky for bed
maybe
ohhhh okay i think spotify has a sleep timer so maybe keep the headphones by your pillow and set it to 30 minutes(?)
oh true
And read a nice little slice of life thingy too
I read slice of life manga to go to sleep too so
i think heâ€™s cooked
head to bed dawg 😭
White noise might work??? Shuts up my brain sometimes
maybe
Or pick a song and loop it while putting ur fav characters in scenarios bc it helps to direct the thinking
true

hopefully tomorrow alan has a happier more yuriful day
No TODAY will be a yuriful day for alan bc he's going to get some good sleep

Both can be retail or meal plan
Ah okay thank goodness
you use Duolingo.....?
duolingo is pretty useful for learning vocabulary or scripts
as long as you're reading up on the syntax/grammar elsewhere, I think it's pretty good
LMFAO
i think they take it as an insult just maybe
it's so weird
forever grateful that I have friends and textbooks to learn from
for german
well
I think that's the issue with language apps it's just
They try to be *everything*
I just personally found when I switched to methods other than Duolingo my learning increased drastically
i have. no experience in web design (which is why i haven't started this project)
But it'd be fun
fr
There's a website that teaches Danish in a very logical way that I liked
Yeah. I'd have to look for the link though
okokk

You know what happens right?
SPINACH SANDWICH
YESAAAGGAGA
oh boy
first napkin ice cream
then spinach sandwich
The spinach sandwich has been happening since like O-week

SPINIC SANGWIC

Nom
no sauce in it
just spinach bread and meat
They had no mustard
just put some ice cream in between
ketchup
then wrap the entire sandwich in a napkin
this also
that way you get napkin spinach ice cream sandwich
best of both worlds
💀
if you were braver youd do more spinach
(To reef)
whatttttt
sometimes i like to think about the wildest things
Wait now Iâ€™m curious will you try it when you come to Case??
Case, where we have case studies of interesting specimens
If we did case studies of each other we could get publications with our names already, thatâ€™d be kinda cool
indeed i will
iâ€™m actually intrigued
wait this could be such a cool idea
iâ€™d give kyle the code name â€œNICEâ€
napkin ice cream eater
I think Leo deserves a code name as well

So fucking good
Yes
Grand slam
I might be a zombie now but these pancakes are  so good
ah nvm
Did they put brains in them perchance?
No

They knew
😭😭😭 the desire for pancakes was to strong
The Den is colluding with the zombies!
I did say you needed better protection
hayley i apologize
def not
🤐
did you go
mhm
were you already a zombie by chsnce
Does anyone know roughly how long the Den wait is looking rn. Like how busy do they look
or did you survive
not at all
to this
That might make den times better actually lol
I mean thereâ€™s a smaller proportion of people playing hvz than youâ€™d think
so not too much better
Is anyone actually there rn or was there recently
Kaavya and Hayley were
Oh ok
i was there
basically no one till the humans showed up
Dealing with leg cramps and hip issues lmao
gotta admid the pink lemoade is fire
you could just. not chase them.
let them waste energy running from you
so?
or something
Nah
so just a matter of laziness then
I see
Yeah letâ€™s not
well hey I just meant the laziness of preemptively putting down the band instead of just walking and not chasing and immediately getting stunned
I guess you may as well have it up
Just to spook em a bit
exactly
I mean maybe Iâ€™ll do one more chase for the night when I grab my den order but after that I legitimately will be crippled
This is barely helping me walk rn
Did you injure it or something?
@thatoneguy2609 saw earlier today too, along with some other people
I hope your legs will recover soon
It will not lmao this issue has been happening since junior year of high school lol
Anyways yeah my right hip is out of commission for tonight

the mac and cheese is good
Itâ€™s not
You probably eat the powder from the box
True but still does it matter for you that badly?
why would i do that
I second this
THANK U KYLE
Poll time?
Hand Mac and cheese
Napkin Mac and cheese
yall r horrid
bowl mac and cheese
floor mac and cheese
veto
fine
ceiling mac and cheese then
it's the opposite
Thatâ€™d be interesting at least
hmmm
so the existence of floor mac and cheese implies the existence of ceiling mac and cheese
thus the inbetween spaces means wall mac and cheese exists
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cringe-dies-diesofcringe-theruxemburg-gif-25773904

Mf is having out of body experiences before heâ€™s even made it here
gotta think **beyond**
or iâ€™m just paranoid
Of Drew Meyer?
â˜¹ï¸
Barebones it
We could probably give some advice regarding that
youre right but i think my number one priority right now is to make sure i dont enter college with a diabolical sleep schedule
its gonna be cooked regardless
Dw, if youâ€™re on discord, youâ€™re not making it out alive with a normal sleep schedule
I consistently slept at 4 am the summer before coming here
jesus christ
this already intrigues me
welp 5am-8am high school sleep schedule we meet again
3 hours is crazy
At least 5
ah i see
uhhhh
somehow did for me
ur body forces you to 😭
example time in senior year
Yeah no that was me in senior year too sometimes when physics C started kicking my ass in
charge ur phone 😭
fineeeee
nah like even that was my schedule but id sleep for like
jesus
I also have another entire thing to consider which is that I was auditioning for music schools AND doing Texas all state for violin while doing high level youth orchestra
Which for anyone doing music in Texas would know is an actual monsterous task
holy christ
my sister in law lived there for 7 years and she said it was high hell
Oh it is lmao
List is not limited to
- Straussâ€™s Eulenspiegel
- Barberâ€™s School for scandal overture
- Romanian Rhapsody
- 
-
Other pieces include the entirety of west side story, pax de dax (that Tchaikovsky piece), and the entirety of symphonic metamorphosis
Yes
Well the orchestral one by Leonard Bernstein
Were you practicing all of these simultaneously?

Tack on the fact my shoes decided itâ€™d be very funny for my laces to trip me twice while sprinting results in that
HAH old 🫵
Itâ€™s not an injury per say but more of a â€œmuscles are strainedâ€
You prob could not outrun me lmao
:duckstare:

Race me at japancase tmw lmao

||Ivan and Till, Hyuna seems cool too||
shit i like everyone in alnst actually
they're all my favorite characters
Luka can go krill himself
Great question
which menace tanked this 😭
No clue
I have no clue what entropy or enthalpy rly does either lmao
Tbh may redo all of my chem notes over the weekend
Anyone going to noche
Entropy (S):
- represents level of disorder/randomness within a system
- higher entropy leads to greater disorder
- generally increases in spontaneous processes

Enthalpy (H):
- represents the total level of heat within a system
- includes internal energy and the product of pressure & volume
- negative enthalpy means a release of heat into surroundings
- positive enthalpy means an absorption of heat from surroundings
Yeah Iâ€™ll prob just redo my chem notes lmao
you got this 👍
I like physics E&M
How is it, if I may ask?
P understandable
And a lot of it is conceptual but if you can sorta visualize lines in 3d spaces, it can become easier
Interesting

But seriously, itâ€™s better to get things checked
Ok
snakes are tubes but alive
discuss
If you say that, then humans are also tubes but alive
so by that definition
every organism is just a tube
No
why
thing goes in
thing goes out
a tube is not too different
A tube typically has 1 primary entrance and 1 primary exit
one opening/closing, and another opening/closing
Cells are not tubes
sphere
In that sense, actually, animals are actually a series of tubes
cylinder
Which is not what the typical cell is shaped like
kekw lmaooo

what if your bed had sentience, and what if it enjoyed people laying on top of it (specifically a little too much)

That is
What if nobody answers the question?
Quite the question
As a comp. engineer, you should design a device so that you can personally ask your bed
the device could just be another human within the mattress
Agreed
what if i had a ventilation system within the mattress
Do that but with the bed frame to prevent murphy bed suffocation deaths
okay alternatively
what if it was an AI that responded to various probes that answered
Iâ€™m curious
But save those for later
but what if i asked now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESx_hy1n7HA

fixed leutner
thats suspicious
genuinely
He added yogurt water and orange juice (freshly squeezed)
Nah he did cook
You got to believe
the face my face is facing rn
Took the salty ass Leutner soup, and added a bunch of Greek yogurt (to act as heavy cream or milk), added orange juice (to add sweetness and zest), and water to water it down
You got to try it to believe
im very concerned rn
mmmm hmmm
Uhhh interesting
u coulda added ice cream
if they had plain ice cream

Did he do smtg im not aware of
did he post porn or smth
????
i just saw that he was banned lol
what
oh lmao
for "rule 2"
that was a while ago
i think
o
He was banned well over a week ago lmao
^^
wait what
Yep
honestly
can confirm bro got axed a while ago
given how little i check discord i'm not surprised that he got banned lol
anyway
they warned him not to post stuff that was too uncomfortable and then he kept doing it so
Soft core eroticism, lewdness in message (and general weirdness), and like posting soft core pictures ofâ€¦ idk what
anyway, our villain of '27 is named Simon
what did bro do again>
?
So Imm not a primary source
But reportedly he was being weird to women on snapchat
Also was transphobic to people in the 27 server
And disappointingly surprising
😭😭😭

wait ive seen arnav in physics, i think
He wouldnâ€™t perchance be a MechE/aero major?
oh god i remember simon
Perchance he is
Yeah for some reason heâ€™s in CHEM 111
Are you in 121?
He is??
Yep in my discussion section
Sits right next to me
Oh wow

question music nerds how do u find the chord progression of a song?
Determine the key youâ€™re in, followed by what notes stack together
Do note that itâ€™s not as easy to do that with modern stuff, especially more abstract music
can a song's chord progression alter a bit, like being mostly 1-4-5 but switching to smth like 1-5-4 for a few measures?
I think so? If youâ€™re listening in classical progressions there are rules but outside of it itâ€™s more like loose suggestions

What if I breathed in pure hydrogen followed by drinking hydrogen peroxide all in one breath and let it mix in my mouth and then stomached it
Hypothetically and scientifically speaking
But h2o2 + h2 should be 2h2o
Florida would be closer for Burmese pythons
Also might release more heat, I'm not sure of that's an endo or exo thermjc reaction, but either way, probably not optimal
erm
so i should do it (for obvious reasons i will not lmao)
okay but what if i did in a lightbulb
How
*shoves lightbulb in mouth*
Glass shards in mouth and throats, leads to cuts and bleeding out and or infections which leads to possible sepsis which is really a painful way to go

Most people I know recommend it

Whatâ€™s the harm in one session?
Or maybe Friday
maybe i'll do mine next week i have legit no time this week

questioning the meaning of life
i mentioned this last night at like 1 am
I see
welcome to every mwf night my first semester because my first seminar was about aging and my post 9pm thoughts immediately went existential
it's not even that my question of life is about aging
it's the fact i joke about the fact i'll die before being 25
yeahh that might be something that might need some unpacking

my brain is nocturnal I think

maybe our brains work in different time zones
mine is always 24/7 just kinda existenstialism
then again at lunch today I was having really useful thoughts about social construct theory and whether or not femboys are a crytocurrency. no context necessary to understand this.
"femboys are a cryptocurrency" kekw lmao
Yep certainly none required
my argument was that if one could buy and sell femboys, they would be a real currency, not a cryptocurrency. as was the counter argument.
on friday i had an insightful debate about if zombies sweat or not
after much debate we settled on â€œit depends on the zombieâ€
As a zombie, I can say that at least I do
thatâ€™s the correct answer yes
lol
was this after i went chasing wren and kyle lmao
this was at 5pm before the meeting lol
I think the big argument would be whether or not their bodies have enough water in them to sweat. and their biological systems may or may not have degraded to a point where sweating would be impossible.
ahhh see we were more focused on the idea of the zombies being controlled by cordyceps
ah
why is everyone so chronically alive at *midnight*
well then, those ones probably subsist on whatever cordiceps subsists on.
or well
also im marking bowings in my music
very slowly
I get to sleep in a little tomorrow

the best brass instrument is french horn
might just be me
YES
FINALLY
if you can play it well, i acknowledge your existence as a very great brass player

nerf gun misfired. darts only flew a few inches.
cornered by two zombies.
heâ€™s about to sue nerf
Gotta hit the report button and call an emergency meeting
This is why HvZ is strict on vocabulary. Bro watched someone get tagged. Their blaster misfired smh
oh true
Their weapon*
Lmao as an HvZ person this is why we say "tagged" "stunned" "blaster" "darts" etc.
Thanks Jake for getting there first
i mean personally i think its really funny to see messages like that with or without context
hello there folks i finally invited my main account to this server
yay (i am the alt)
sleeping until noon is anazing
Iâ€™m confused why are there non 28 hear?
this is a server mainly made for undergraduates of '28, but its meant to be a community that also accepts other years because they often have advice or are able to help with things usually
Wait I thought this was exclusive for 28
nah its mixed
always has been
its not a matter of like "you only need to be 2028" here its a hub for '28 to meet eachother as well as other people
why not :mochibeam:
I'm just here because I have an addiction to discord
word

the more the merrier (only downside is the constant sisyphus in #counting )
Whatâ€™s sisyphus is it a disease?
https://tenor.com/view/sisyphus-rael-gif-943215023730044045
its a "meme" about this one story where sisyphus is cursed to carry a boulder up a mountain and the boulder will never reach the top because itll keep falling
roman legend of a man cursed to push a rock up an endless hill forever
Thanks
So close thatâ€™s syphillis
No shot Blud is premed

"no shot" is just a term being like "no way", it's just slang

jamaican slang but its like "friend" or "bro"

Is this the site you mentioned?
LMFAO
yeah
precisely
@reefrider also whatâ€™s the hunting Leo game
ah yes
@leowhygamma did something devious
and hes getting hunted down when i come in january
Like what do tell
thats easy
caught me lacking in #counting
when it was 200 something
i got admitted in the spring
Whatâ€™s the difference
Also how do you know Leo
you come in january instead of june
thru this server
Donâ€™t worry I gave him a heartache last night
that is something i must plan and prepare for
LMFAO
whatd you do
interesting
If I tell you, youâ€™ll be mad and the rest of the server will be mad and Iâ€™ll get an angry mob ditching out mob justice
interesting
i will say that i will one up you
when i come

💀
@reefrider youre a spring inductee right? are you graduating spring '28 as well?
my advisor said for sure during 2028
depends on how many credits i take
hmm
So where are you from
are you ahead in credits? you may be early grad
new york
sorta?
i skipped to calc 2
and had enough credits to fulfill a english 200 course
hm
Isnâ€™t this only applied if you take a 300 level course?
If itâ€™s AP at least
if you play your cards right youll probably grad with us spring '28 but otherwise probably fall '28
yeah, ap credit only applies if you take a 300-level course
it was IB and iâ€™m not sure entirely sure?
IB may be different
IB is different yeah
lucky
ib haunts a person
trust me i understand that
but its not much better here
Ib is similar I think as if I remeber depending on classes you could get 3 credits per HL course that you get a 5+ on
it depends on what case accepts
https://case.edu/admission/apply/ap-ib-college-credit
:bob: question: was it just me or on orientation speech he looked entirely different from the pictures
He did
Its not just u
Me neither and i have spoken to him 1on1 😭
When
My favorite fun fact is Kim jong un took the IB courses lmao
Cool
He even failed CAS
If I remebered correctly
Hey Leo you took IB too?

Also Iâ€™m not sure how insulting this is for people who took the IB, but in my highschool the English teachers Werenâ€™t teaching the students any content and just expected us to know shit so the students staged a protest to show â€œhow much we value Englishâ€ by using English class time to do CAS reflections and TOK works to say non verbally  that we value English lower than cas and tok? Do you think the message was sucessfully sent?
Is it good?
Tis waiting
Itâ€™s p alright
Just remember, its over now, weâ€™re free
Real!!!!
lmao
I might as well just completely skip the next one then
or maybe not
obviously
Only skip the next exam if youâ€™ve gotten like 92 or higher on both previous tests
I think one was me 😁
lmao
since a dart may have hit the zombieâ€™s arm before it tagged the human
Greek
fun
i forgor
i translated it in latin
Not dropped but replaced by your final

so I just have to do well on the final and Iâ€™m set. my two exams are good enough that Iâ€™m chilling.

NOOOO

https://tenor.com/view/demon-core-beloved-locket-nonagon-gif-26043045
I heard MIT has a nuclear reactor of their own can CWRU get one too?
not our problem or focus
some physicists were playing around with a sphere of plutonium, half-domes of beryllium to explore criticality. should the domes fully close around the sphere , the plutonium would go supercritical, as like a nuclear bomb. they held the domes open with only a screwdriver. then the screwdriver slipped.
so the mods should definitely delete the screwdriver message

Plug it into 3ddesmos
I understand this
triple integral in polar coords
oh I see
yes
yeeees
the old nuclear club equipment is in there
two hemispheres
Fun fact, I use to write nuclear as newclear
lol nah its not *that* dangerous
you have to be careful and limit exposure obviously but its not gonna cook you instantly if you drop two halves of it together
Like yeah it's not gonna sear off your flesh but either way you *will* be cooked
radiation poisoning is STRONG
insane statement
very incorrect
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
no the demon core is LITERALLY the fissile core of an atomic bomb.
that's what it is
same
i wanna test my dosimeter
in addition. nobody who has seen the demon core go off lived a full an healthy life
"It's not gonna cook you instantly if you drop two halves of it together" that is *literally* what it's famous for doing. TWICE
LOL
yeah lmao
So what about cobalt bombs
Why
Do you guys know what a cobalt bomb is?
LOL
and, as it is every night, the server chronically online

im procrastinating my essay :D
Wait we have a Minecraft server?
no no no, i meant the discord server
although i could host a minecraft server for yall to join
dr strangelove reference
Marvel?
no that's dr strange
dr strangelove is the movie where a general goes rogue and tries to launch a nuclear attack on russia, at which point russia reveals they have a bunch of cobalt bombs hidden which would automatically detonate if they detected a nuclear strike.
good movie

it sounds fun
you can double count them but you basically have at the max 17
Self referencing that loops on it self
phys ed sure yeah but like those arent academic classes and have correspondingly lower difficulty
And how does it have anything to do with CWRU and being loop
okay and aiqs forgor that one thats mb
you have to be pretty lucky to have your classes line up though to get all the double-triple counting classes
Thanks
it was for me :(
wait phys ed classes are mandatory?
yeah, 1 sem of movement and 1 class of nonmovement (or 2 movement)

ahhh
Astrology is the one dealing with horoscopes and using the stars and constellations to make prophecies or future predictions
I may have read astronomy as astrology
youre fine

Yes

yes
you get to wave a big wood stick

Kendo is more with wooden or bamboo swords while iaido can use full tang or half tang swords that if used correctly, can slash people
I prefer hema more
hema would be super fun
Agreed
Full plate armor with swords and shields
YAY
Hema you can also use axes and hammers to bonk people too not just sword

Itâ€™s British tyranny beverage
Itâ€™s coffee and pop for me
plenty of non British countries enjoy tea too
green tea
YESSSSS
hojicha
it's also heavily dependent on the water quality fun fact
barley tea
It was a joke reference from Cartoon Network TTG episode 

https://youtu.be/kExvak0_E2g?feature=shared
green tea lover 💚
it's why the same leaves brewed in water from texas and water from tokyo tastes so so different
Itâ€™s just hot salad water
delicious hot salad water
not joking, i can't drink any tea in america cuz it tastes mid, but in japan i was drinking tea like every other meal lmao
not to mention every conbini has hundreds of tea options for near zero prices
YES
🥲🥲🥲
ito en oi ocha 🤣
LMAO
fr 😭
maybe i could ever so conveniently look for a Co-Op or study abroad experience in japan for an excuse to go to japan lol
fr
I would love to go study abroad but it would have to actually be useful to my major
same
i was thinking literally the same thing
hol up
i think theres a japan program for engineering majors
but thats not the same
im just doing gen eds and filler credits in japan
ah
yeah i'd need one that has both music and engineering ;-;
might be good to ask one of the advisers what they think
theres also always the faculty trips
there was a 3 week kyoto trip onitsuka sensei led
i would def want to try tokyo in that case cuz my aunt and uncle are there, along with my grandparents so (also my cousin too lol)
niceee
waseda probs has music stuff
iirc, case makes it so that whatever amount you pay to attend case will be the same amount studying abroad

"place" 😴

"place, japan" 🤯
*has an actual answer*
Understandable to some extent, but my own need for self preservation overrides my own love for my own culture as Iâ€™m Thai and I plan on fleeing when Bangkok sinks into the ocean
So how did you reject your culture
Also I think we might be the opposite then as I actively reject my own culture from my immense hatred for Thai food, media, and music
yeah i get that
yup
birth rate hit the floor
pierced through it
birth rate hit the floor harder than i hit the floor when i was born /j

China is leading to userp Korea as I think Korea beat Japan already
@reefrider wait so are you Japanese if so Iâ€™m confuse are you full or half?
Just curious about the culture of people here
uhhhh
iâ€™m like
itâ€™s confusing
i have australian blood
japanese blood
pakistani blood
british blood
Mr worldwide
but mostly bengali blood
iâ€™m like a mix
of a LOT
cuz british loved colonizing us
so reef's blood if poured into a bowl is technically an international soup
practically
https://tenor.com/view/mr-worldwide-gif-26368506
Wait you have older siblings?
yup
i have an older sister and im the younger brother
Whatâ€™s itâ€™s like to be a younger brother then becuase for me itâ€™s the opposite
then i have cousins, who are younger than me by a p large degree lmao
get bullied to shits lmao, but also get the experience of your parents sorta learning what not to do with a person when going thru life
Well itâ€™s the opposite as when your younger parents shower younger siblings with love and care while the eldest is â€œneglectedâ€ to an extent as youâ€™re their test dummy on parenting 101 so they have no prior experience to go on. However when youâ€™re in teenage years itâ€™s better as since they have no prior experience, you get away with things and more freedoms they donâ€™t let the younger siblings have
true, tho sometimes the love can be less helpful and just more overbearing
Agree
Btw what type of parenting do you think is better western or Asian ?
Also define bullied
depends
uhhh getting kicked, stepped on, bitten, and also yelled at by your sibling 🫠
Same but throw in fights
Hahaha
okay
suspicious too, made yesterday
Yeah that is a known scam format

what can you even spend non meal plan casecash on
burn it at mitchells instead
ermmmm i think i used some to buy a lab coat and goggles at the bookstore
huh. I think I had to use real money for that.
and then thereâ€™s bookstore casecash which is only good for textbooks I think
Is the bookstore casecash the one you have to pay back, or was that a different thing?
yes

How banned is he as a subject in this server
Why
We just like to joke about the fact he got banned
I thought he was like Valdemoro
Voldemort
Oh thanks
Nah
More like he stacked a bunch of small infractions on top of another
As Toby described it, he was "memeing it up"
Like if you take bio or chem some of the premed required classes line up with it so that's cool, but not so much for CS or most other engineering or non-natural sciences stuff
But I think it does also depend on which degree you're going for
when he first joined he just stumbled through every channel like he was drunk posting about how he was cranking
I'm going for a BA, so it's less coursework than if I was going for a BS
I mean he often is
true
Whatâ€™s cranking
Going insane
Being erratic
Plus if you do a BA you can take the life-science versions of courses, so for example I'm not going to take PHYS 122 (engineering) and will take PHYS 116 instead
Very true
At least from what I understand it to mean
Question: if your tasked with sacking one of the meal swipes location in CWRU where would you sack
Aka disband
Probably PK
Itâ€™s just the least necessary
Controversial opinion: Fujisan
Did you expect better?
local taco
Actually true
Local taco
It serves its purpose of mentally ruining me further
Just extinguish it from your memory smh
fujisan's the only place on campus i can find white rice
Repress all memory
sack taco
Local taco is not very good
It can go
Itâ€™s good
taco bland
Nah

I accuse Kyle of witch craft
Also know the show reference
Bland, soggy, crumbly tortillas plus eh ingredients
Itâ€™s pretty obvious this time lol
Oh agree I thought you meant the tacos in grab it as itâ€™s where I use the Doritos to make nachos
No, the food location called local taco
Oh that stingy place where they even screw the ships and stingy on guacamole and beef tacos yeah it can go
That is true tbh
Controversial opinion, but chipotle taste weird
Fujisan
Please note: Leo is Japanese
Also this
The only correct way to cook rice is with a rice cooker, specifically one that sings when it starts and stops
Fujisan is better than sushi in Japan
For real
!!!
Iâ€™m gonna shatter you like glass
https://tenor.com/view/meme-anime-girl-angry-scary-gif-21631852

Good thing then if you decide to wear your kendo gear
melt U
Bro 💀
LMAO
You cannot do this to me
Kekw lmao
Tbh the cheese look gross like itâ€™s something else
and current melt U has like 1 thing iirc?
Actually Leutner late night
Freedom of speech
Same but for fujisan
Whatâ€™s iirc
Thatâ€™s just how melted provolone looks
https://tenor.com/view/gjbu-anime-tea-sip-vomit-gif-9051584
Shorthand for if I remember correctly
Wait omg what did you get???
Sourdough melt with provolone cheese and chicken 💙
Thanks
Looks like plastic
Ooo that sounds good
1 very customizable thing
It certainly is!
No mushrooms ):
There is a better one than melt u and itâ€™s by the same people from the den

Look up the meltdown
Noooo ;-;
Wait I forget do you need swipes for Fribley late night?
They have other combo too
Late night swipes
Ah okay
Dennyâ€™s?
Yep
Itâ€™s worth it
Doubt
Where is it?
Door dash
Bro thatâ€™s like so much extra fees
It can NOT be worth it
Yeah
Late night leutner can satisfy me
If Iâ€™m paying for meal plan, Iâ€™m using it
No itâ€™s not
Itâ€™s more normal to go on Euclid
And use case cash
if i paid for the whole speedometer im gonna use the whole speedometer
I try to limit actual money to once a week
Hells fried chicken and ohtani are up there
You only have 200usd of case cash for the entire term unless parents bought more
Im gonna hit up ohtani more when it gets colder
200 usd???
That's actually such a nice idea
Itâ€™s  CWRU debit card so just get a real one where itâ€™s usable everywhere
But also like that's a lot of money to eat out a lot/order from outside, no?
My point is that case cash comes with your meal plan, so you should use it
https://tenor.com/view/kto-kounotoritoken-kounotori-lbow-storkholders-gif-25676352
But let's maybe not commit crimes
ill try my best not to
Meal plan is 3000 usd up if I remember correctly and I have plan to burn my case cash as I donâ€™t like having it I prefer my debit card more
makes sense
i wouldnt unless hunting leo is a crime
If there is ever an opportunity to use case cash, then why not use it meaningfully?
Which goes to food
Rather than use all of it frivolously
So go to Euclid for food to use it
Every so often
Then why spend actual money?
So for the times you do eat it makes more sense to me to limit the amount of spending on outside sources
That makes sense
going out to eat is nice sometimes. in moderation, like all things
Agreed
I suppose
Most of his reasons in the dm are angry anime girls gif while I gave logical explanation

Also Iâ€™m a commuter do my dinner are off campus
It should have the fresh coolness of the fish with the nice warmth of freshly cooked sushi rice that has rice wine vinegar, salt, and hoshihikari rice perfectly blended together
Ah okay same

Leo and Tham rn
Lmao real
i have had sushi from a few good places tho
probably not as good as japan ofc
Do you ever go to Chabad?
Thatâ€™s precisely what makes it good???
Whatâ€™s Chanaâ€™s
Chabad
I did for the sushi shabbat lol
yes
Jewish community
Itâ€™s old
To some extent old
imo i feel like if any asian restaurant is run down you are gonna eat the greatest food of your life
Old does not equal dirty
But it's not like you'll get food poisoning or somethign from it
the best restaurants are the old ones
they're not usually chains
just quality
That's very true
They have *SOUL*
no literally just ANY restaurant
hole in the wall restaurants are so good
although actually with old restaurants you're equally likely to get "greatest in your life" as you are to get "just a metric ton of grease on everything." which to many, are the same thing.
Bro my favorite Vietnam restaurant has been in the same god damn location in Texas for over a decade, and their fried rice is just 👌👌👌👌 and theyâ€™ve always had it under $10
Old often means well established, and thus quality
??? Where did you go???
No???
Literally look at the photos Leo sent
Why did i come back to a war
No plastic
Tham
to me there are two classes of sushi place: there's the "your standard rolls, looking very plain, sometimes offered in frozen containers" places, and your "we've got a whole bunch of cool specialty rolls" places.
Oh word
These are the only pictures I have of foods that are in non washable dishes
Guess which one is meant to be eaten out of the non washable dish?
that looks so good man
Wait what is the dish in the top right corner???
Agree
And guess which was from zipair (airplane food no less)
It looks so yummyyyy
That takoyaki 😍
lmao
It says Zipair on the napkin Leo
definitely not the one with the zipair napkin
LMAO
Also the airplane food was actually more expensive than a good number of the foods I ate at Japan too
I have to ask though, was the Zipair food good though?
Oof gl
It was okay
Zipair my beloved, it has such a weirdly cool livery too

They prob do. ANA and JAL have some of the best airline services out there
ive been to a lot of states but ive only been to canada international wise

Ha ha yes
Si paid 15usd for a single tuna nigiri
Said it was from a 80 million yen tuna
Yeah thatâ€™s a scam buddy
That sushi places in Japan have similar presentation to fujisan
Thou still I belive fujisan is better
How???
YOU PAID 1800 TO 2400 YEN FOR A SINGLE PIECE OF SUSHI???
California roll

Hai Leo kun
Scam
Average price of good sushi is like 400 yen max
Like thatâ€™s going premium premium level Iâ€™d say
More like 1300 yen

No the USD to yen conversion rate Iâ€™m roughly guessing is anywhere from 120 to 160 yen
Me too, man, me too
wow
food
yes
incredible
:mochiclap:
id eat a caseoh portion size of that meal
No I converted to thb then usd and it was years ago I remeber the average price and had to look back up in my diary

Donâ€™t forget 3coins as well
Itâ€™s a popular dollar store style chain over in Japan where you can buy most things with like 300 yen

ra: "...yeah I don't think that's gonna come out"
and for reference, i have done this as soon as i got out of a shower before (without getting clothes on), next to my bed, or right next to the bean bag, often times waking up at 2am
and it smelled funky for two weeks after they cleared it
Also Clarke people how do you deal with the laundry
we have shared living spaces and communal bathrooms
not all of us are off campus Tham
the entirety of 4th floor taft put in a  request for our toilets to be fixed during O-week

My goodness
You see in Thai Cat is called à¹à¸¡à¸§ (ma-ow) so I kept saying ma-ow to my kitten to adulthood as signal for when Iâ€™m feeding it treats and it would say ma-ow back to me every loud and no meows

All of its meow are ma-ow
i approve of the meows :nice:
Aww that's so silly but also cute


no
NOOO
So in Thailand my cat would litteraly say Cat instead of meow

So anyone know best way to avoid angry Leo?
step 1. admit that fujisan is not peak sushi
Yep
No I will gladly say fujisan is the best sushi
Better to just admit Leo's right in order to avoid all unnecessary conflicts
good luck then
we'll be seeing your appendages made into sushi before the week is out

Yes
Insane statement
So then like
Just American sushi
Who let him cook
This is what the war has been about
when you go to heaven, god will judge you, and send you into the deepest pits of hells for your sin tham
My sushi taste is tamago and California roll
What sin
Are you Christian?
this is literally white american california girl taste pallette for sushi
no
i have no religious ties to anything
Well surely an actual sushi place would make tamago better
Why white California girl
it's a stereotype
Itâ€™s not sweet

I like my sushi sweet

Sushi is sushi

but then again
for me
Yes but most of the malpractice incidents I heard off generally are caused by the nurses
Ah that must be hard actually
LIKE AM I A LARGE

WHY AM I SMALL IN THIS?
Yeah but also doctors can just as easily cause harm

So true actually
Youâ€™re telling me a rice fried this shrimp
Iâ€™m not a doctor and info I leak is on news paper finadble via google search
Ngl even though I still haven't met you I do have great faith you'll be a great nurse
True
also trust me YOU DO NOT
I do 😭
the amount of cuts caused by stretch marks on my back
is diabolical
just like people
Also a combination of that and availability bias
and this
Oh yeah thatâ€™s rough
because of how thin the skin became
On that psychology grind 🤩
You know it! 🤩
Yeah I'm still cooked lmao
chat are we feeling cutesy and lovely tonight
Hopefully it'll be fine because I will be getting more than two hours of sleep
chat i wanna go gym now
The dichotomy of our discussions
Yes, well please recall that this was in Asia and depending on the country they could be behind in the medical field and in a lot of countries nurses are not allowed to to a lot of things
No, that is example to show how its world wide issue
wait what's going on 😭😭
Sure
yipee
Iâ€™m certain you can also point to many cases of physician malpractice as well
We are talking about biases in nursing and healthcare
Specifically with incidents
How about you?
Yo do we acc got problem with nurses 😭
during the day, this server has ZERO functionality, however during the night, 15 different conversations take place at the SAME TIME
join in
for the weebs at CWRU
Cwru moment
Hayley is correct
I've heard of the nurses not being good side but also I've seen doctors being harsh with the nurses as well
Valid 😭
doing good but I will eep soob
ive had both sides of the argument
I can and will fight people on this
back when i was first misdiagnosed
Yeah we should all sleep tbh
OOF
THE NURSES
BITCHY
AND EVERYTHING
And I hope you will feel better soon as well
I know itâ€™s fucked up
😭 yeah unfortunate reality
the nurses were amazing
supportive
but thats why I'm doing nursing so I can be good to patients
and outgoing
Not every place is going to be good
But I can be
in both the workplace
That is true many doctors I know on personal level agree
and how theyre taught
Thank you honestly
Nah u should fr nurses do so much
make this place better
Fr
be that person
NURSES AND DOCTORS ARE A TEAM
HEALTHCARE IS A TEAM SPORT
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE STRESSED DOES NOT MEAN BE MEAN AND LASH OUT
doctors and nurses are under the hippocratic oath
From a doctor I asked honestly, the reason we have nurse is so a doctor can use their more valuable time on something else
to provide the best care possible given the circumstances
if either side cannot comply
it will fall apart
In conclusion, the world would be a better place if everyone was nicies to each other and doctors and nurses stopped fighting
ITS NOT ABOUT WHO DOES MORE ITS ABOUT HELPING THE PATIENT
PATIENT COMES FIRST ALWASY
yes â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
each role has their part in a person healthcare
LET HAYLEY COOK!!
they co-exist
Agree but most of the screw ups are cussed by nurses (from UH doctors gossip)
buddy
Again, confirmation/availability bias
consider taking a little bit of a brighter approach to over doom and gloom
DOCTORS FOCUS ON DIAGNOSIS
ON IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM
NURSES FOCUS ON THE PATIENT
nurses and doctors have their own roles
WHO INTERACTS WITH THE PATIENT MORE? DOCTOR OR NURSE?
NIURSES DO
this is like saying an engineer is better than a machinist
BOTH ROLES ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT
shhhhhh
Lear?
SO STOP BEING A LITTLE BITCH BABY ABOUT NOT LIKING NURSING FOR YOURSELF
Ok ok our original point was why I didnâ€™t like nursing as a major
Iâ€™ll will give a detailed explanation why
Wait who is Lear?
THEY ARE YOUR COWPRKER
😭
BE KIND
BE NICE
nursing major
THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK
@snsc
Oh yeah that's the other thing the workplace drama is not worth it
IF YOU ARE DOING PREMED, GET YOUR CNA LICENSE
AND UNDERSTAND THE VERY BASIS OF PATIENT CARE
i would consider nursing
Ikr??? It sounds so cool ;-;
I mean it sounded like this was all part of your argument as to why
You can tell when docto has worked as cna
but my hands are *as* stable as they should be
i have nervousness
and shaky hands
they're nicer, they're a team player, they understand how fucked up it is and tries their best to work
Okay legit question are people who are first semester freshmen already getting clinical experience???
cna is very valuable very good to get experience wherever you can
I know a few ppl who r volunteering at UH and CC
Uh
You need to understand the lowest level of the medical field in order to provide the best medical care you can to a person
It's fine next semester :/
I know He Who Shall Not Be Named Has Done a BUNCH
Because before the illness, a patient is a PERSON
Bro ik some ppl r alr doing research 😭
THIS IS A REAL PERSON THAT YOU NEED TO CARE ABOUT
What sweats
He is an MA
OK WELL THAT'S UYOU
I LOVE NURSING
you know there's a nursing shortage too right...? 😭😭
I really wanna volunteer in clinical research and see if I like it
BECAUSE RESIDENCY IS UNDERPAI3ED FREE LABOR FOR YEARS
fineeee
ILL BE MAKING MORE THAN YOU OUT OF COLLEGE AND YOULL STILL BE IN SCHOOL
ill give nursing a try
Yes I do know that, but at the end of the day what can do more good
AND THERE IS A NURSING SHORTAGE BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU
Damn that's a good point actually
YOU ARE NOT A CLOWN, YOU ARE THE WHOLE CIRCUS
Yeah...
such a doomer attitude tbh...
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Shits unfair
you are hating at nursing simply because you can not see yourself as a nurse
Standards must be maintained
it's not even logical 😭😭😭
Dw, I'm sure you'll get into med school
it might be unemotional, but it's also not very illogical
because you can not like something for yourself and still see how it is valuable and important
Also unrelated but what medical area are you thinking of going into, if any Skylazer?
lmao
Cardiology
Omg that's so cool!!!!
Just that thereâ€™s a shortage in doctors does not mean nurses are irrelevant
so true
Thatâ€™s like the only thing Iâ€™m interested in 😭
Besides neurology
Dw I get that lol
:duckyblidedbythelights:
being money driven only to do work is a great way to recreate what happens in black companies
cardiology is pretty fun yeah
Really only point 1 here argues against nursing itself
im interesting in pre-law, applied mathematics, forensic sciences, psych-ops, nursing, pre-med
Bs md â˜¹ï¸
theres like
so many angles
Bros interested in everything 😭
yeppers :patthepotato:
But omg it's so cool
And I love eyes
how do you not know that nurses are vital then?? 💀
And vision
And yeah
you shouldve SEEN the letter to my advisor
3 and 4 are essentially sub arguments of point 2
might as well throw up my hands and give up on life with that attitude then, because everything will have it's shitty side, and we have to choose what to take both good and bad
Hehe opthalmology makes me excited even though I know so little about it
I'm interested in aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering and also writing novels on the side. and I love learning history too but that's pretty adjacent to the writing.
Yo the eyes r so cool I remember dissecting a goatâ€™s eye in like 5th grade
https://tenor.com/view/uncanny-emoji-angry-hakayaki-hakayaki-angry-emoji-gif-13101565263917230073
plot twist most people have interests outside their majors. what a surprise.
Nah but having that many interest is so cool tho
It was fun
my dad does that!!
You did??? Luckyyyy
Omg that's so cool!!!!
i wanna do nursing or premed but my grades in bio and what not were dookie
fifth grade dissections are why I have decided neurosurgery is not for me lol
bio is not important in the end what's important is if you can be good to the patients
I mean u can major in smth not bio and just take 3 bio classes
i love to care for people
interesting idea
ill think about it
Yes!!! It's only the surgery tho, not the lab, so I know some people who work in the labs who weren't too happy about that lol
I only like anatomy and physiology
what is bro saying - Styl P

Nah shits getting real 😭
Hey got to be devil advocate
Lmao
buddy all of us have a p heavy workload regardless of what profession we go into.
that's your decision.
Ah true
you were saying things that were plainly incorrectly or offensive about nursing
This is a valid point, but the others are quite disagreeable
your decision is your decision, but you also said some harmful things about nurses.
you can dislike it sure
but the idea of using exercise for rehabilitation is fascinating and extremely personal to me
but understand that is is important
bastion argument or whatever.
Sheâ€™s not the only one who disagrees with what youâ€™re saying here
tis fine, it's not your fault
Do MechE were superior than everyone else just trust me bro
Ew physics

I am using profanities because I tend to get heated in arguments about things I care about and I apologize if that comes off as me being rude
all im gonna say is that although i have only skimmed over this argument, i have not seen u type a single non-negative thing all day bro

hm
CS :mochicheese:
ill think about it
and how I disagree with you about all of it
CS = $$$
do compe and music (and die w/ me lol)
The usage of profanity does not necessarily diminish the point
Hey donâ€™t make our friend reef homeless
not sure why you're so hung up about profanity when you were also being directly disrespectful
Iâ€™m speaking the truth
ad hominem

(im just playing around)

resorting to attacking the use of profanity is not helpful
nor a valid tactic

Alanâ€™s gonna get a job because Alanâ€™s chill like that

I hope so

IV'S ARE DIFFICULT
not just IV's but just even getting needles into veins and arteries in general
this waas insane to watch
I have my traumas
which, might I kindly remind you, does not invalidate the entire field
From my own experience 60% are like that but I admit 40% are nice
😭😭😭 not us having the same story
no way
had i not been properly diagnosed by the nurse and doctor working together, then i wouldve been cooked
even until today
Oh pelease I have doctors horror story too
every doctor does
ive heard
from my own sources
many do
everyones heard
or read SOMETHING
on the matter
Some do screw up and way more issue that nurses
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES PEOPLE TO THE MEDICAL FIELD
IT'S BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE BETTER FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONNS
THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE
MONEY IS NICE, BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU ENJOY DOING THIS
what
sorry im actually guilty of this, i learned how to look at veins in my junior year of high school and now when i see nice veins i have to tell them

LMAO STOP I remember when I was younger my mom would always comment how this vein or that vein is good for putting an IV in (she's a nurse)
I've also heard doctors describe organs as "yummy"
thank you thank you, also just reminder for everyone in here incase you don't check roles, i do infact use all pronouns ;)
Nah
you can â¤ï¸
let's get that done then
no let him speak
@hellspells i did check dont worry

also my veins are only visible in my hands regularly but if you stick around until after my gym session, it pops more
kekw lmao
Okay it is not that hard if you are usually your muscles to do it

i doubt this is gonna get anywhere regardless
https://tenor.com/view/gif-gif-19495479
its gonna be an ouroborous
that's alright I just need to make sure i properly educate people
XENOBLADE REFERENCE?!
that's one of the many roles of a nurse
hence why I would like to experimentally verify it
Ohh that's cool
save the emotions for something more meaningful than one random guy lol
:paimonNomming:
go to therapy - styl p
whotf is styl
ok well um, maybe get some therapy dude
tbh there was this one time i straight up yelled at a homeless dude on the train because his smelly ass wouldnt get out of my face
it was a friday
Made cat ears for alan I think
lovely person
Changing the topic I see
💀 what
honestly. :kekcry: thats funny. keep doin that shit
OWO
:catto_bloosh:
but again, why generalize this to an entire group of people?? 😭😭
But have you been betrayed by your own kin, have you watched your own grandmother laigh and justify why her dig was right to try and maul your own baby sister to death
I believe this an entirely new topic Tham has latched onto
and this also applies to nurses too
and once again they are demonstrating they cannot separate personal trauma from developing into harmful stereotypes or generalizations 😭
Letâ€™s just say I have seen a lot of things in life that made me lost faith in humanity
fr and those group of ppl help save lives 😭
Essentially completely unrelated to the prior one in order to avoid further discussion of the previous one
one person said that the key to writing good poetry was to "press enter" a lot. as in having really short lines. and then wrote a really weird poem complaining about how you have to have a ton of disabilities and other diversity points in order to be valued. which perhaps was pretty genuine but also. we made what we called the "bigotry bingo board" which featured lines from it.
hello styl
Styl idk who you are but hi you're cool
consider regaining it thru love and some sort of passion that comes from the heart, not from greed of the mind
styl is amazing
THEN STOP BEING A HATER
Or if not, the one to bring that faith back to others
not with this attitude - styl
NO GOOD DOCTOR IS RACIST OR A JERK
Styl is cool

I AM A SURGEON!!
like how do you think any of that was going to be a productive conversation
one person (age around 13 at the time) had their entire personality built around being desperately in love with the fictional character they created.
I treat everyone equally
me but with levi :catblush:
ok
Are nurses a race?
LMAOOO
huh
Why do people talk trash about politician then
BECAUSE THEY BE MEAN

how bro felt
Different range? :(
bro thought he cooked 😭
buddy it's almost 2 am. We are not pouring gasoline out on the open like the US should come invade
Iâ€™m saying the same thing while are some jobs values the same and not others, you can have an honest politician but not malevolent nurses
What da hell is going on here
MDO
a lot
PLEASE
god knows
mods
mods
SHUT OFF CHAT
its unreal 💀
TURN OFF SERVER
NOW
you literally cannot have honest politicians
Good morning Charlie
Yeah Iâ€™m out
Yeah I mean that is the real reason. Was just making a joke
YES
THAT WORKS TOO
this is the most active it's been in a while and not a very good reason :/
yeah because politicians are all a part of a system which prioritizes the solidification of personal power and thus the priorities of their wealthy donors over morality and the actual will of the people
War
fr can we go back to cats 😭😭
hope you reflect on all the pushback u got bro
genuinely
Ah mb
Even though I've only played the viola for one year I would defend it lol
bruv dipped the second a mod showed 💀
tennyson already on my top tier list

hi
rule 4
Yep
that is true but like, when arnav was banned you guys had some sort of short discussion right about it prior to it (if i remember correctly)?
wait since when was your anilist in your bio 💀
not defending him, just surprised at the speed
literally forever
i have had the same bio for years
What he was doing toed the line
:bcroll:
There are elements of individual moderator discretion and urgency that goes into these decisions
true
arnav was arnav but also he was pretty harmless, at least from a conflict perspective. this is a very different story.
i like this charlie guy - styl
whos arnav
well chat it's been wonderful talking but i fear it it is almost 2 am and i have lab at 8 💀
like crabs racing into a bucket of fire
good night chat have a lovely halloween
In the future, ping a moderator when you see rule breaking behavior so we can deal with it sooner
good night cwru 28

Good night 😴

bro is
Alan please promise me you will go to bed and rest
PUHLEASE
As the psychology book says, sleep is good
bro was sipping on his tea
That is true, and thank you for doing so
What Thamâ€™s probably thinking: â€œWow what a bunch of snowflakesâ€
2028 list of people not to talk about
1. Tham (dethroned Arnav)
2. vacant
3. Arnav
idek why he said i was his friend tbh... more accurate would be loose acquaintace...
Move arnav to #3
whos 2
UHHHH
LONG STORY
I will say, now I'm kinda curious who Tham is, especially given he's in my class
@katsukurry_32009 morning

me rn doing calc 3
Me copying down 6 tables that are exactly the same into my lab notebook
https://tenor.com/view/anime-frieren-sceptic-sceptical-sarcasm-gif-7975720640396280876
Yes
same im so cooked
wait you in chem 113
thursdays?
i gotta wake up at 7 😭
yeah
Ye
8 15
rough
1:00 pm
so lucky
wait were in the same section lol
Ayy
:mochiclap:
Me neither lol
Another thing: I do not understand this experiment in the slightest 😭
im just gonna watch the video after i finish writing the instructions and sleep
Good idea
be like me with 8:25 am music theory
everyday ^_^
Nah
is there mandatory attendance
yeah ;-;
lmao thats rough
Now wait just a minuteâ€¦
ITS 8 F*CKING TABLES
istg
wait what
why 8
â€œCuvette 1-6 (including cuvette 3 in the ice and hot baths)â€
1 table for cuvette 3, plus 2 more for the two different temperatures 😭
Itâ€™s honestly pretty easy and not too much workâ€¦
SAVE FOR THIS ONE EXPERIMENT
yeah it just takes alot of time to do the lab reports
Yeahâ€¦
Good to know. I just think it'll be funny to pull up as an actual upperclassman to take freshman chem lab
my RA (4th year) is in my phys 122 class lmao
This entire procedure is taking up more time than any lab report
alan go to bed
just hopped out the shower 💀
True, but it'll be funny if they ask me what other classes I'm taking and I list off like a bunch of 300 and 400 level math classes
the absolute blasphemy that's going on rn
this
istfg
its 3
easy
while robin is singing sway to my beat in cosmos is such a dichotomy
for alex, this is fun. for me, this is hell
Maybe listening to robin will give me the strength to do thisâ€¦
Depends on prof. I thought it was fine
is long tran good
for me he's just okay. Some units are just hard for me
I like him a lot, but it's a bit tough with him teaching such big classes lately
eurhythmics
Music ensemble lifestyle
wdym teaching such big classes
And pe
r there more ppl taking calc 3
than before
He's been teaching 100 person calc 3 sections, rather than like 30
good question
- math 223
- MUAP 121
- Muth 101
- PHYS 122
- CHEM 111
- MUDE 101
- MUEN 3XX
ah i see
cuz it slaps, next question lmao
AI use is cringe imo. But it can definitely be hard to wrap your head around calc 3
@mism0937 do u know what an ice table is
i know it's cringe ;-; I just cannot get my head to understand the concept of maps and mappings, along with the jacobian thingy
like a lot of calc ab and bc i understood cuz i could tie a good number of it into real world concepts
That funny table with an arrow in it and xâ€™s in the procedure
OHHHHHH
got it
Have you tried YouTube videos or others? There are some very nice explainers
maybe whenever another break comes along (hopefully before it breaks me)
I'm not an expert, but I can try to help, at least with big picture stuff
alr
my goal is just to kinda scrape by for now tbh...
At least I hope or else all my efforts are for nought
my tables r so ass
Gotta do what you gotta do
ICE stands for Initial, Chance, Equilibrium, and Iâ€™m assuming â€œFinalâ€ is the same as â€œEquilibriumâ€
It would make sense that that would be the case
*RIIIIISE UP INTO MY WOROROROLD*
*RENEW YOUR DEFINITIONS*

You got this Clarisse!
Wait Kyle can I ask you a psych question
Heâ€™s the f*cking reason why I was doing lab tables till 3:30 am
Sure
Ty 😭
NOT WHY
BUT HOW
Like what part is it part of
Wow that question does not make sense reading it again
Yeah 😅
Well definitely associative learning obviously
Itâ€™s from associative learning?? Idk why I remember reading about it then 😭
It was like with the thalamus to the amygdala
Oooohhhhhh
Bruh Iâ€™m probably cooked
I see now
Never mind then
Itâ€™s from sensory/perception then
Ohh okay
Ty 😭
May have to do with thresholds perhaps???
At least if weâ€™re talking about sensing/transduction
Sensing/transduction???
The initial detection of the stimulus and the conversion of the stimulus into neural signals
Lab at 1
;-;
Iâ€™m glad you slept at least
Oh we might not have covered that unless Iâ€™m not remembering correctly
Interesting
Different professor, different material
Itâ€™s okay, thank you so much tho
technically 3 is closer to 4 because we like even numbers
but 4 is such an odd number to multiply with
so technically we use 5
but 5 looks a little goofy
so we technically you slept 6
7 is
@reefrider do you have an CDâ€™s
â˜ºï¸
Youâ€™re right, I feel so well rested!
Good afternoon Leo!
Skipped music theory

id hope not
which is why we add paperclips

So then why can we add these?
amog us???
wait hol up, yall down for minecraft?
Î”Îš becomes KT and KR
Note that Î”Uw consists of both M and m, which is why later it simplifies
So then the Î”Uw from m would equal Wf, so then ultimately when those cancel out we have conservation of mechanical energy?
Essentially yes
hope this helps!
bro im at 7

okay I'm done. time to watch the greatest halloween movie (cowboy bebop: knockin' on heaven's door)
Hey @carbonchain if I may ask another question what was dtr(Y) for in Origin?
that's the simulated data + random error
actually its nightmare before christmas
wait is there a bs for biophysics
https://tenor.com/view/cat-wake-up-physics-gif-13858508
😭
Oh so then is the dtr(0) the estimated time between measurements from the pulley and then dtr(y) is the uncertainty of that?
no
dt0(y) is what the time between measurements would be in an ideal scenario given the inertia value you put in, and dtr(y) is a simulation of what actual data might look like.
the uncertainty is different
ofc!
Oh so the dtr(y) is the simulated displacement, not seconds right?
What Jonah said
No, its the simulated seconds
Wait
I gotta check actually
Yes its the simulated random seconds
dtr = dt0 + delT * grnd(),
Or

Î”tr = Î”t0 + Î´t * grnd()
Where grnd() just randomizes the extent of Î´t
So you create a change in t with some error
Ohhh okay
of course !!!
however
Oml 💀
😭
godspeed to you clarisse
💀
Ty 😭
but try your best right now!
what i like to do
is visualize it
imagine it in action
when I try to do physics itâ€™s usually fine but the moment I walk into physics lab my brain just dies
Yeah, diagrams help a lot
Real
Maybe I should construct them irl
once you can visualize and understand this clarisse
that mental block goes kaput
Physics as a whole exists to describe the patterns and properties of objects, so following the process of observation then description could help put you in a mindset that can digest the concepts
Those are good ideas
Thank you
See if it helps
no problem
and good luck
you got this
You can do it!

Oml youâ€™re right
i keep getting this jshell error
yes
Im out of ideas
wait it just randomly fixed itself 😭
im going crazy it works sometimes but not others and i have no clue why
the mystery of coding lmao
is it encountering some unique out of bounds error or smtg?
no jshell just sometimes refuses to recognize my classes for some reason
L
aka i liked the colors and font sizing of it
also cuz my dad told me to use it for java coding over eclipse lol
it takes a good while for it's compiler sometimes but it's just more consistent
anyone else doing newtons method rn?
personally I think its really dumb and somewhat outdated especially when we have graphing calculators
where's it centered off of to rotate or?
the center of the shape
I THINK I FOUND THE ISSUE
PLEASE TELL ME THIS WORKs
How is the shape defined?
its a polygon defined by its points
It seems to me like you're generating a new triangle instead of modifying its original points
its the same triangle object
is it the same reference or object?
reference*
wait
im actually not sure what the difference is completely
make sure u don't assign smth else to the same reference
the reference is the address and the object is the value stored?
in reality no in practicality yes
FIXED IT HELL YEAH
huge
what was the issue?

so i had a loop that would go through each point and rotate it around the center point
but it used the getCenter() method in the loop, which would update the center point each time a single point was rotated
so as the points were being rotated the center point was shifting
all i had to do was store the original center as a variable before the rotation
😭
okay but repeatedly calling the rotate method causes the center to slowly shift over time 💀
oh yeah classic one
not sure if this is another bug or java being weird with doubles
is it when you keep on rotating it one way, or is it shifting regardless? cuz that maybe a roundoff error?
i think it might just be roundoff errors adding up
not too sure but its trivial enough to ignore (for now)
they do
they fix it by truncating the values off at a certain number of values
ohh
check your TI-84's thingy
so they just be precise enough that the displayed digits are accurate?
yeah
ah cool
that makes sense
doubles can be tricky sometimes

DUH
CLARISSE?
trader joes is kinda based and fire ngl
But def not Trader Joe's
from earth
ohhh okay
also @katsukurry_32009 i listened to all the song recs
and oml theyre fire
Yeah Trader Joe's is pretty good, their Ube ice cream is way too sweet tho
Wait you did???
yup
before my nap
I'm glad you liked them tho :DDD
and after my valorant session

these were some of my fav
Hehe I'm glad you got some new good songs
I've only given song recs to I think two other people, and for one person I think they liked like 10% of them at most
YES
i love them all
i love trader joes
i was just too lazy to add them to liked (even though its a simple swipe)
Lmao that's okay
Omg now that I think about it the Calamansi ice cream is really good at Trader Joe's when they had it
Cookie butter is also immaculate
calamansi?
i only hear of their marvels from others
ill walk there tmrw
Ikr??? It's strange
The one from the Asian supermarket is def better
Of course!
Wait Kyle, what is your opinion of ube ice cream with cheese?
CHEESE?
ICE CREAM AND CHEESE SOUNDS WRONG

ill try it once though

ill try it once though
ITS NOT SWEET

You like mint choco? Nice
Mint chocolate is nasty
Nah
I agree
It's good as long as it's not too minty

too much mint is like toothpaste
i jsut found the gif lol
Beat you to it lol
if its the right amount of mint its perfect
exactly
the choco balances it out
I see
having mint by itself
tastes mid
I wouldnâ€™t know
why
And I have no swipes
Ye
Iâ€™m also shocked
no
same with me

and i gotchu
I just prefer spartique to den
Bro youâ€™re not even on the meal plan
Iâ€™ll do it lol
I send you the screenshot of the receipt right
Yes
k
Thank you 🙏
Spartique is good but very filling
Also no weekends
true
It definitely is objectively better
kyle really said "if i pay for the full food plan, imma use the whole food plan"
😊
also kyle

what are the differences 😭
what differences
the places
Each one has its own swipe limit
what do they serve
different food
Itâ€™s usually pretty obvious
Specifically which ones?
like theyâ€™re all different establishments, not just different locations of the same food
ohhhh okay
deadass?
Yes
im boutta be eating good (id hope)
Every place is different
yeah itâ€™s a lot of options thankfully
bet bet
I have no idea what Iâ€™d do if I only had leutner to eat every day
either starve or learn to cook
or both
😭
id assume fribley is better?
Iâ€™ve been to leutner once this week lol
Depends
I oftentimes forget itâ€™s dinnertime
oftentimes I know itâ€™s dinner time but make the calculated decision to wait and just get spartique
what even counts as dinner time
or den if itâ€™s a weekend
sounds like me
Then itâ€™s late night options
Which you get via mobile order
ooh interesting
because i typically have dinner at 8
I like the fribley vibes more, but wait times are often longer and food is usually not too different qualitywise
Lmao
Anyways, apologies for the tangent

has anyone taken ARTS220? Is it something a beginner could do to actually learn?
ART220 is photography 1 right? 
If so I took it and loved it. I had no photography experience going in
Let me see if I can find some film photos I took (both for that class and on my own)
what a guy!
Pro tip: Buy a really basic camera, something like a Canon AE1 or Minolta SRT101 (I love my SRT101) that comes with a 50mm prime lens. 
The basic mechanical cameras are more reliable, easier to use (for the purposes of the class) and generally cheaper on ebay then the newer cameras

avoid bader
Bader is very self-taught

ah a fellow sufferer
Ye
As in you teach yourself
2x speed baby
only to mess up 2-3 mcqs off of horrid wording
Yeahâ€¦
I definitely dislike the structure of the short answer portion
Tbh though I think Iâ€™m one of the few people who is actually ok with him at this point 😅
Iâ€™ve heard heâ€™s bader
Heâ€™s the baddest
Wait
No
No
the badest
Ayes there
Heâ€™s the Baderest
If you have an a I can see why, you understand how he thinks and can do well on any assessment
He is very difficult to figure out at times
But once you do things start to make more sense
Itâ€™s getting there thatâ€™s the issue
Can you help a brother out in the getting there part
Itâ€™s kinda hard to put everything into words, but I can probably spell out a couple things
This was such golden insight thanks man
Np 👍
Also one more (bc discord character limit)
I hope it helps!
i recently reframed my complaints about physics into "this is part of what makes a bachelors of science degree well designed"

Letâ€™s just hope January 6th is not recreated again
eh youll be fine
I got outed as a foreigner in Japan, and Iâ€™m literally Japanese kekw lmao
why do u always say kekw lmao and not one or the other
heâ€™s quirky
Iâ€™m stupid next question lol
*correction, smtg tistic prob

fooled so many people with pro palestinian stance â˜¹ï¸
whats the lore?
He back?
it's joever
Our next president is donald trump
yeah if he wins pa he wins
Itâ€™s not over till itâ€™s over people!
chat yall forget
the cities (that are mostly democratic)
start counting first
pa mi and wi all learning towards red
most of the suburbs have generally finished
hmm
lets see
The red mirage as they call it
Or blue shift
Hey both candidates have been president before
At least both have gotten a try at it
No matter the result
No?
exactly
no?
i mean harris as VP yes
theyâ€™ve both been in power
Kamala Harris was the first female us president for 85 minutes during joes colonoscopy
its not gojover
It better not be joever or weâ€™re quite fucked
precisely
who knows
if she clutches up PA and GA
Lmao
we got a fighting chance
True
PA has Philly and GA has Atlanta
First bank is to hope a miracle of a Kamala win, second is to hope the electoral ties and the house chooses correctly
PA also got like Harrisburg and GA has Savannah
give it another hour
till more is decided on the swing states
Iâ€™ve given up
Time to move to Canada
only coverage of this i'm gonna watch :pepecomfy:
PA is gonna be a heavy nail biter rn

:(
That scares me
like do you not see how fucked we can be?
Thank you for telling me this exists
Is that f*cking Ludwig?
How ignorant are people in the us to vote for trump
alot
trump is gonna be a two time president before america elects a woman to be president 😭
Gavin Newsom 2028?
no its maga mail
:C8:
HOL UP
LEAD IN PA
no way
it was 160
now itâ€™s 113
grover cleveland is my only two-time president
wait moreno won?
yeah
UGHHHHHH
yup
who fired a single mom for getting one legally?
and refused to pay his employees overtime
Honestly yeah
and then shredded the documents when they started investigating it
Welp time to integrate myself into another state
project 2025 is a fucking numbing document
time to move to canada
Trump projected to win georgia and north carolina, it's joever for kamala
Yeah Iâ€™m shocked that people would vote for someone who legit willingly would happily ignore his own peopleâ€™s voice
Harris is going to win :0
well
;-;
its locked in
kamalas winning
then it must be true
Pls let their words be true
https://tenor.com/view/gamblecore-stickman-casino-gamble-gif-7118676210396292522
These vibes in the server rn
Prayge for it to be true
it must be what the prophecy has prevailed
:AltarePray:
This is not the fun kind of gambling, that's for sure
bro lowkey
my brain is like
physically boiling
of the possibilities
This!
Is this Altare
some of us are more insulated to the result of the election than others

wait
yall remember
Im going to pray nevade turns blue
that if the gap is super small
Sometimes i realy wonder how anyone with a uterus is voting him
the votes get recounted
yay west coast pulled up
True
or testicles ffs
Anyone with a somewhat functioning cardiovascular system tbh
or neither
so if by some off chance the gap is small in georgia or PA or any big state
pretty sure trump is winning mi
we might have slight hope
minnesota?
michigan
HIW IS HE WINNIJG MICH
I thought she had it in the bag
28%
well
mi wi pa all need to be blue for her to win
harris def grabs NM
if even one flips its joever
I hope wi pulls thru
And pa
unless Nevada goes democratic somehow
itâ€™s jover
theyâ€™re voting for stein
all part of trumps plan
Nooo
literally going nowhere
i even uber eatsed food
Stien votes are not the votes changing the election itâ€™s independents going for trump
Yep definitely failing CS tomorrow
The blue wall can hold
Thereâ€™s a chance
bro if trump gets GA and kamala gets PA whats gonna happen
r u in 132
Blue wall is now a red wall
and it was blue in 2020
Kalama has to come back to win
Again, mi is at less than 30% counted
nevada and WI or MI have to clutch
we have a chance in PA right
yes
we have a chance
itâ€™s low
PA is 72% reporting and she is down by 3.5%
im praying bro
wait WI is so close
Yes
we got 33% remaining
yo same im so fucked
hope we can cook
theoretically if we could send a few more hurricanes at florida this situation would be fine
praying my fellow Wisconsinites come thru
yeah writing code on paper is tough
In case you need to add an extra variable
Wait what is that called I can't even remember 💀
I'm so cooked
yeah i'd say so
Wisconsin was supposed to be the best blue swing state
fock
FOCK
ehhhhhhh
csds 132 u just have to treat it like its 4 or 5 credits
Any update on PA
but its a really good course
ive done like
arrays
thats the most advanced ive worked with
i've coded a few small projects in python before csds132
If you want coding experience Iâ€™d say make a cipher using just java to get yourself started
gap is like
maintaining
most of paâ€™s uncounted votes will be philly, Pittsburgh, and mail-in/absentee
of a data
PA typically finishes all votes
and counts
by 1:30 - 2
Christ youâ€™re going that  deep
with verification coming the next morning / afternoon
BUT
No flips?
given to mail in ballots
being increased in volume
and efficiency
iâ€™m predicting itâ€™s gonna be verified at 2:30

Itâ€™s gonna take. A miracle but I hope nc clutch somehow
Wisconsin is now the most red swing state that she has to get
so that confusion does not pile up
Likely because most of the vote is in
jill stein.
these other parties
istg
65%
their votes are dumb
the project is not really related with what he have to learn
yo cnn got MI blue, AP got MI red???
unless you genuinely have a chance to win
yeah we should suppress third party votes
she fooled people into thinking she was pro palestine then switched up before election
AOC is outperforming Kamala
shes basically a waste of space
trump won NC
Mi is at 31% counted, too early to say anything
MATHEMATICSLLY
KAMALA NEEDS TO WIN NESRLY EVERY VOTE AFTER THIS
TO WIN NC
Yeah 😔
yo im trying bro
yep but campaigned as pro palestine

acc funny
until election
ong
gangstas
convicted felon
bro
if trump wins
iâ€™m deadass
going to manhattan
and pissing on trump tower

One Central Park West?
oh wait
there r barely any votes reported from detriot
millions must vote
wait what if yall are trolling, and we're actually about to win
i doubt iâ€™d be trolling if my brain was boiling
its novembover
YUP
TRUMP CONFIRMED

Not surprised
â˜¹ï¸
alright iâ€™m getting ready to piss on trump tower
brb
I feel like my music theory teacher tmw will walk in depressed from this tbh
wait
hold up
gap in wisconsin
is 60k
with a third of the state ballots uncounted
uh
man how is donald trump gonna be president again
what
oml
Its mindbaffling that we live in a time where people are willing to vote for a LITERAL FELON to be president
i asked a MAGA dude in manhattan a question
If the gop has one thing going for them, itâ€™s that theyâ€™re concerningly good at propaganda
he said no
mfer started to blow up in my face
man looked like an idiot on 5th avenue
💀
No states have flipped compared to 2020 people
oh i know
i would NOT talk politics in a red state
Trump won SC in 2020
iâ€™d get shot

Youâ€™re nvm
Tru
arizona got a big city
iâ€™m think she clutches there
Kamala can afford 2-3 states flipping to red
whatsoever
bro lowkey
i wanna blow my brains out
WAIT
HOL UP
PA IS SLOWLY LOWERING
BY THE THOUSANDS PER MINUTE
We knew that would happen, pa uncounteds are mostly the cities and absentees at this point
Question is will it be enough
iâ€™d hope
i genuinely hope
*Hopes and Dreams intensifies*
Virginia!!!
:BunYay:
Virginia is as expected so far
For. A min there I was getting nervy about VA
and az
imo nv is more of a wildcard than az
Itâ€™s not looking great, but itâ€™s not over
😬
Ikr
So maybe
Hopefully
but Im not going to jynx myself
Mmm you;re right
Are we all hoping the remaining states will swing the way it did 4 years ago?
indeed
dem votes usually come last
Letâ€™s hope for that
Dangit Alaska why does your stuff have to come out around 1am
Canâ€™t wait to show up for lab tomorrow horrendously sleep deprived
Otherwise I'm not going to make it past tomororw
Gl o7
Again, she can afford a maximum of 36 flipped votes from 2020

Someojr commit voter fraud
You guys with the CS test tmr
Hack into the system
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Kamala can afford a maximum of 36 flipped votes
Virginia and Georgia is 35
theyll just say it was fair and they finally fixed the elections!!
Do they just say â€˜we outvoted the impossible number of votes that our opponents got because weâ€™re just so coolâ€™
youâ€™re going to have one?
iâ€™m already having one
georgia is projected to win
Nevermind, 1 vote in Nebraska was flippedâ€¦
So she can afford 35â€¦
120K votes gap in goa
Ga
Looking better than pa rn
yeah
NBC called Georgia for trump
YUP
SAME
CNN called GA for trump
The remaining states (if following the map of Biden V trump) will have Kamala win barely now
Goddakit
NO GODDAMIT
210 to 246
â˜¹ï¸
bro
bro
thereâ€™s no way
system
ff
ffs
We also know Alaskaâ€™s 3 will go to trump most likely so itâ€™s more like 210 to 249
Nevada gonna take 3 months like always
ofc they are
imagine the tiebreaker is nevada
Kamala can win but its so unlikely I'm willing to bet $1,500 on it
we gon be biting our nails
for life
guaranteed
i agree
Unless all the other current contested states come out to be for Kamala
I think? Right?
Surely?
Trump got shot in PA right
yea
By a registered republican
wait
this all
Heâ€™s getting PA then
makes sense
WAIT
HOLD UP
Cuz those two (PA and GA) plus Alaska makes trump 268 but if all the other states follow Kamala itâ€™ll be 272
THIS ALL MAKES SENSE
THE PITY FACTOR
Exactly
he getting the country
Aka a barely eeked out win
Itâ€™s pity and sexism
Is half of it
I bet
man why
WHY IS AMERICA
Yes a yell, like a loud expression
If the 1 vote from Maine flips to Kamala she will have room to spare
hurting like a bitch
not enough room with red pa

in the FAR future, but the future
we are so cooked
Where in the fuck did that one extra vote come from
triply cooked
@leowhygamma Probably nebraska
one of the small districts
or Maine? I think
One of the northeast colonies
why ny red
people moving from south to north
People are flocking out of NY in extraordinary rates
like a disease
that too
***ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER PEOPLE***
Literally how what
@gnp4736251 High cost of living
Lot of crime
Well
Corrupt institutions
i agree (until pa gets called)
I think this confirms my plan to move out of the US in five-six years
@carbonchain Come with me to Dubai
Habibi
pa only takes him to 265

@thatoneguy2609 Alaska + Nebraska/Maine districts
Takes him to 270
lmao XQC pulled out his Harris bet, saddest clip of the year
it's over
yo no cap
i hope that man chokes on something and dies if he gets elected
@gnp4736251 So does Door county in wisconsin
and they voted blue
we can mathematically to leos credit, but a red pa means me crashing out
but I think WI is red anyways but huh interesting
Mathematically it's possible but Alaska is going to be red
he is the oldest candidate ever yeah
and has the most impeachments
No exception
and most assasination attempts in this mellenium i think
yeah it's over
It's that simple lol
If the 1 vote from Maine flips thereâ€™s a chance
No
The house is red
True, however Iâ€™m also basing it off of the results of 2020 which is prob not the greatest way to do it
In terms of a tiebreaker
Why they counting si slowly
exactly why im lookin at them counties now
https://tenor.com/view/caelid-caelid-birds-kaperoo-elden-ring-gif-25557463
Iâ€™ve run the numbers, it will not be a tie if the 1 vote from Maine flips
Wait nevermind
F*ck
I think it's over
event centre county went red
this is so goddamn depressing
ah]]\
Just put the fries in the bag
😞
NO

Yea^^
Yeah this is fucking miserable

Iâ€™m absolutely tilted anyone would want such a man that was so happy to abandon his people
PA MARGIN IS NARROWING??
I keep reading AP news as Action Potential News
I do not like that man Ted Cruz
Why is az taking like 5 years
In PA
He almost if I remember correctly tried to remove music as a necessary part of education in Texas and remove funding for it. You know, the one thing weâ€™re actually rly famous for nationally being good
https://youtu.be/NsHgQI8s9G0?si=1y-ar_15Ut5dr0eb
If PA is called for trump there will be actual screaming coming from Clarke tower and not good screaming
Trump off by 12k votes in Las Vegas county

Iâ€™m not joking he legit did that, and then the Texas government like a brilliant dumbass was like â€œhey what if we removed a cap on how expensive energy can be temporarily to solve thisâ€
NEW HAMPSHIRE JUST DROPPED
+4 aura
come on
How did she get to 214
214 to 247
OHH NH
New Hampshire
FINALLY
Oh I see
Ye
new hampshire got called cheer up

ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS
Are you at the 11th floor
AP called NH
MAKES THEIR MIND UP
dw bucks county is only at 69%
I went a few times with hannah
Are you there rn?

^
hey i like garlic noodles than my name
ah
@gnp4736251 buldok?
I genuinely think my music theory prof will just cancel class if trump wins
garlic noodles are you going into biophysics or did you just ask me that out of curiosity
whats that
rule 1
Korean noodles
Yum
Id just love to know one of the few diff eq freshmen
the spicy noodles
hey you know me and have seen the other one
can you perhaps say that musically
I dreamed this
happening
Joever
Me too
I like music that changes key signatures by a half step
I remember trump winning in my dream
...
One percent more counted in PA
PA unfroze
itâ€™s not looking good dear god
Just put the fries in the bag ap
😞
take me with you
Why did Arizona genuinely just stop
Counting
Like hello
oh um maybe use th toilet
Iâ€™m considering Japan as an option now srsly for my life
no clue what that mean
Thatâ€™s honestly a mood

daz hang out w me tmr
i might
i might just hole up in my room
Has anyone called pa?
but i cannot go to drew meyers class and pretend evedythings okay
Why is everyone coping
because philly reported at 71% rn
philly is massive
yeah its 4 counties
Will it be enough
78 now
I know but like realistically speaking
Trumpâ€™s gonna speak
theyll prolly count every vote since most incoming votes are blue
Shuhhhhshshususushhs
or before if ur too anxious
***ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER***
***ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER***
I agree with kyle
chat
until pa is called
was marry a girl
settle down
and live a nice
decent life in a city
with rights
but erm
that may not be possible now
Thatâ€™s honestly what we all strive for give or take reef
makes me feel unsure of my efficacy if I ever hopefully become a medical practitioner of some sort
PA called for Trump per Fox and Reuters
Congrats to Donald Trump
that's chilling
Nonono
but ill wait for AP even though reuters is mostly unbiased
Trump is going to speak in a few minutes
harris got 0.2 percent back in pa on CNN
Or no itâ€™s smaller
48-50.9
***ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER***
***ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER***
***ITS NOT OVER TILL ITS OVER***
Hopefully AP calls it soon
wait how did trump go from 246-247
on ap
Nebraska district i believe
vote in district
yeah
This country is going to pay for their decision
PA is going to call red, almost all of philly has been added to the vote
So there's no possible way we'll have enough blue votes
Yay
Yeah*
NOT yay
i'm going to go to sleep
what a shitty country we live in
take this time to talk to people and make sure they know that you are there for them
i worry that tomorrow when we wake up to red, people'll need the support
Iâ€™m staying up as usual
Dear god
A tie would be nasty
House chooses
Goes to the house
A tie = Trump wins
gop controls the house, tie is a loss
Which is republican majority
And knowing the goddamn stupidity that goes on, yeah trump wins
And we plunge straight into hell
Is it already confirmed the gop got the house
So weâ€™re about to have a republican president house and senate
thats why he stacked the courts
Yes, each state gets 1 vote. Republicans control a majority of the state.
and the supreme court 😃
the US is not going to recover from this
Weâ€™re about to have no abortion rights
At all
goodnight case western, i appreciate y'all
They will but only after the country has crashed and fallen apart enough
tomorrow is another day
Hopefully Trump resolves the wars, all I care about. Stop the Ukraine war, stop the Israel war
And also prob no health care either and an increase in monopolies and corporate greed to absolutely kill us
Agreed
Heâ€™ll figure out a ceasefire trust me
Itâ€™ll be messy but itâ€™ll happen
He better
And said she was anti Israel
@leowhygamma thatâ€™s what ceasefires are for!
They both get millions from AIPAC. No candidate is better than the other.
I bank on the fact that his ceasefire will involve doing the bare minimum, and then leaving the conflict to resolve with both sides absolutely wrecked to pieces
Yeah but trump is promoting project 2025 😪
Or the Sykes picot agreement?
The exact sameâ€¦
True
bruh
The racism in this country
Sexism
Homophobia
by hand
That was no ceasefire
Iâ€™m talking about negotiations in general
No affair is gonna be resolved if trump gets in (at least not in a way that actually cares about people)
Negotiations, ceasefires, agreements
😔
Exactly
Roe v wade 💔💔💔
5% in PA with 193k gap
yeah pack your bags
cooked
only way it could change is a recount

Please can they just call it
Fox has just called it for Trump
Projected to win Wisc as well
;-;
Whereâ€™s the button to reset this timeline guys
Where did he get 248 from
Where did the extra one
Coke from
Maine probably
Maine district
Stein took over half a million votes from Harris. Good for her honestly
Fucked over the rest of us, but at least she fooled a few hundred thousand people
Sheâ€™s said some weird stuff
Honestly if all the third party votes went to harris it wouldnt change anything
Trump actually has decent margins
Can they just call PA and end our misery by confirming it pleaseeee
ykw
bedtime
we know by tomorrow
Iâ€™m staying up
Iâ€™m also doing chem notes lol
cnn called pa
yup
Iâ€™m p sure the margin of people awake tonight on campus is not insignificantly small
AP has called PA
wait no idts yet

ATP itâ€™s a loss for PA
kyle, I'm about to disagree with your "its not over till its over"
And usually later voters tend to be blue
194k gap for PA
Chances are slim
Should everybody jump on VC sooner or later to have a moment of silence or smtg to cope and shit?
that would be nice but you guys should sleep
Yeah Iâ€™m texting in bed rn
iâ€™m here chat

Christ
with the way things are looking who knows whats gonna happen
nyt also called for trump

Hello Skyler, jumping in on the â€œweâ€™re miserably watching this train wreck unfoldâ€?
yep
None of us here are sleeping are we?
trump is the next president
its been joever
NO
NONONO
F*ck they did
yall please take care of yourselves
Itâ€™s so over
im just dissociating
Itâ€™s over
No
TRUMP IS SPEAKING AND HIS WALK ON MUSIC IS â€œIM PROUND TO BE AN AMERICANâ€
dude on my floor was like "if i were to vote i would have voted trump" cue me and this other guy tearing into gop platform
WHY
Yea this is crazy
This is fucked up
Welp.
every single person is losing with this election
every single one
â€œThis will truly be the golden age of Americaâ€
everyones fucked
tomorrow is going to be miserable
He sounds noticeably older oml
that goes for everyone btw
well gang
4 years till we get another chance
or maybe we can impeach him
and actually get the job done
the presidency, the senate, and the house are all red
pa got called...
we officially live in an all red country
if by some off chance
which is
judicial, executive, legislative are all locked in as red
this presidency actually does something for the people
weâ€™re fucked
we are all fucked
iâ€™m coping
Manâ€™s predicting theyâ€™ll keep the house
With the Senate officially flipped, thatâ€™s all of them
I wanna vomit
pretty much
get ready everyone
reef maybe you should take this opportunity to transfer to europe
iâ€™m fine in new york
Ohio is Vanceland now
we passed a bunch of stuff to protect us from 2025
maybe its time to transfer to nyu
he's going to appoint more justices to the supreme court and they are going to overturn obergefell v hodges and even potentially loving v virginia. what the fuck are we going to do
This is hell
well boys
the most we can hope for
is something happens
within the next few days
Iâ€™ll take being treated as an outsider in Japan over living in the United States
youâ€™re right
I wonder how historians will interpret this
the amount of protests
and insurrections in the streets
Heâ€™s giving special thanks to Elon Musk
i can't deal - i literally cannot deal
living proof that thereâ€™s no such thing as a meritocracy
goodnight case western
I canâ€™t wait to live everyday gouged of what little remains of my soul
He said from the start he knows his health and will do one term.
And a reflection of how little people matter in this ultimately
Democrats have no one to blame but themselves.
True
I canâ€™t wait for a country thatâ€™s gonna tear itself apart
Canâ€™t. FUCKING. WAIT
its gonna be a shit show for the next four years and lets see what remains
whats the over under we have a civil war in the next 4 years
that probability is over 50%
calling it now
Iâ€™d say itâ€™s gonna go from the United States of America to the Swiss cheese of America
*today
im facing the botanical gardens and i keep on seeing campus police vehicles passing by every 5 minutes
We got a NELK boys, Adin Ross, Joe Rogan, Theo von shoutout in Trumpâ€™s victory speech before GTA 6
Iâ€™m going out for a walk anyone wanna join me to breathe or?
ill join

Call the ambulance if Iâ€™m not in strosacker tmw /hj
Please take care of yourself
Yeah my chest is seizing a little
GO.
TO.
THE.
Itâ€™s fine itâ€™s not a stroke or anything
We failed as a country

Officially called
guy won the popular vote
Republicans control all three branches of government now
(I'm delusional)
This is what we get honestly
It's 2016 all over again
We acted like Kamala had it in the bag and boom
she campaigned horribly
deserved loss
sunset for humanity.
life will go on for now.
yeah
our future has just been stolen from us
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_Who%27s_Back_%28film%29
joe biden has the opportunity to do something hilarious rn
Which is?
if he pulls executive orders out of his ass it may take months for trump to take down his policies
True
Question is will he even do things like that
Also Leutner is so eerily empty at this time itâ€™s unreal
Prob out of extreme fear
Also just exhaustion. People staying up late to see the results. Unable to sleep. Etc.
Iâ€™m just naseous
yeah
I physically cannot stop thinking about it
i think if i eat something today i will throw up
itâ€™s over
its been called - if the ap called it its over
according to trumpâ€™s official campaign, heâ€™ll likely try to sue universities to the ground in order to fund replacing the university system with online ai slop.
yeah
itâ€™s called â€œamerican academyâ€
It's not technically official till it's official but AP has lots of statisticians and they know when to call it. It's over
yeah
Youâ€™re one year ahead of a good chunk of us on that path
Just when i finally got happy to have my majors declared
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-the-american-academy
â€œUnder the plan Iâ€™m announcing today, we will take the billions and billions of dollars that we will collect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments, and we will then use that money to endow a new institution called the American Academy.â€
Is he like trying to make the bastion of the world famous for science to be absolutely obliterated???
there is one solution
its just one word
â€œusing the latest breakthrough in computingâ€
called "Impeachment"
republicans control congress
Or we can mass protest
many many reasons.
yes
best case scenario he dies in office - he is rather old
youâ€™d rather have vance?
we still get project 2025 with vance.
i think vance is less likely to try and undue democracy
thatâ€™s true. if trump dies before undoing democracy, we might have elections in 2028.
Id rather have vance than trump, id rather have neither, but out of the two id choose vance
same
and thatâ€™s about the best I can say about that scenario.
yeah
american academy sounds so corny and depressing
Itâ€™s free education in the sense I can go on YouTube to code without ethics
😭
Welllll
On a scale of 1 to 10, my mental anguish is at 12
9 out of â€¦
Honestly it depends on who wins the House rn imo
If we win the House most bills will stop there
The house is not looking good rn either
And SCOTUS
Yo we could have our govt painted red
Crazy to think about
SCOTUS is a more hidden but just as lethal poison for law and democracy
Iâ€™m holding out hope rn

Thatâ€™s true
CWRU better not start raising tuition if he starts taxing private Uâ€™s
Iâ€™m so fucked if that happens
Bro making us choose between supporting Kaler vs Trump,
the irony of the american academy plan is that the reasoning for destroying private universities is that they â€œsupportâ€ pro-palestine protestors
That's so funny bc case does not support the pro Palestine
Well the reasoning is more that  universities tend to lean progressively and are a bastion of pro-Palestinian supporters (excluding large state/rural schools like University of Alabama and the like). Reducing financial support to universities means thereâ€™s less resources for younger demographics to mobilize in support of those policies. University administration is just the middleman.
yeah
we live in a pseudo-democracy built upon many systems which have been enshrined for generations, which were all built upon protecting the interests of powerful minorities (cough. the slave owning south) against progressive majorities.
this result is a product of the two party system and the culture of giving the benefit of the doubt to explicit bigotry and regression.
our modern government is designed to uphold corporate interests.
bro got enlightened
def this plus a large amount of young people who follow openly misogynistic influencers
real
and of course there are countless subfactors, but they all tie back to these in some way.
Itâ€™s soâ€¦ inhumane as a way of thinking and so unartistic in any fashion
https://tenor.com/view/doyobug-mind-gif-21088087
jonah rn
they had momentum following biden dropping out. they took it for granted, then threw it down the toilet.
Cuz itâ€™s all of our future, thrown on the ground, smudged and run over with, and being told that we should be happy weâ€™re not dead
i just woke up to this shitshow
If we decide to protest in such a manner as people did on Jan 6th then weâ€™re not any better than them
yeah thatâ€™s my thoughts
the only way out is a revolution, but a revolution cannot be effective, ethical, and pretty at the same time.
The only thing that â€œworksâ€ is the passage of time but even thatâ€™s such an iffy and not good answer considering the time it could take
and. climate change.
get ready for one of the hardest recessions
yup
We already have been in a recession
Yeah ik
it was def a political stunt
letâ€™s not get too conspiratorial
but itâ€™s not impossible
that was certainly a powerful image
The local level in many places are fucked
Texas is fucked too, we have Ted Cruz, and Elon musk is a Texas person too
Ohio went as expected for the house
It's all red.
the system is alive and it resists change.
We hope it can resist this current change that will happen
but even thatâ€™s not certain
Weâ€™re also losing custodians of knowledge which is terrifying too
real
real
things were looking so good
can we just groundhog day october 2024
Chat I was so happy
This rly makes me wonder what fucking future lays ahead of me ahead of the bright old age of 22
well boys
letâ€™s see how much of 2025 we can get through
or violence
on the bright side, 2026 midterms are likely to flip blue
historically
ID HOPE
Nah man I gotta grow out my hair now and cosplay a cis girl
THE SHITHEADS IN THE RED STATES GON GET FUCKED
THEY BRTTER HAPPRN
AND THEY GO VOTE BLUE
😭😭😭 blue my beloved
oh my god
i just realize
people are gonna start flooding the blue states in visions of hope
because most of them passed something
things for everyone to worry about regardless of demographic:
- climate change
- prices rising and wages lowering
- lack of federal regulation on corporations 
- â€œaiâ€
- education getting torn to shreds
- war
- nuclear war
- climate change
like NY passed Prop 1
yup
â€œbut even thatâ€™s not certainâ€
Jeff Jackson is NC attorney general!
Heâ€™d be a good president
that was when shit was great
ik i was like
7
but at least i lived happily
2x climate change :xsn:

and rallies
george lucas knew 😭
Oh she got attention, just not enough good attention
All that to only have a chance of closing the gap created by a lack of time actually running a campaign
Ikr

well boys
we can be happy
for a while
kazuma kiryu for president
Joe Biden has now become the lamest of ducks
Gotta be real sobering

depending on if i get out of bed by that time i may join u

No f*cking way
i wonder if the reason kamala has been silent is because she's going to call for a recount
its only 13,000 votes being recounted :(
maybe it really is joever
they disappeared because her campaign sucked
^
screwing kamala over by putting her in halfway through
so real
can someone get me into a casino ive gotten pretty good at poker

https://www.reuters.com/world/us/first-us-independent-turnout-tops-democrats-ties-republicans-edison-research-2024-11-06/
thats crazyyyy
She did nothing to run up the numbers with dems, she like Iâ€™m a republican and I love their policy but Iâ€™m different
Dems were like eh
what even was her campaign
they had a biden campaign, he called it quits, she said i'm here now and then that was kinda it from what i saw
yeah this
this
the time crunch was insane
Yeah in the lead up to 2020 Biden definitely implied he wasn't going to run for a second term if nominated so running him again felt like a bait and switch
especially when the switch was right off of the 1st assassination attempt
it worked in a way
for a moment it killed the momentum trump had
Yeah I really don't think Biden would have done any better then Harris did
but it fizzled out when they refused to use it
it should be 😭
it should be
it should be
its cuz people are selfish and are like "eh if i have my rights idc about others"
the leopards are going to be eating so many faces
she did better than clinton. I also heard she did better than obama in 2012.
It feels like being an adult is realizing that millions of people literally do not consider policy past the point of "how much am I paying for gas and whose name did I hear most recently"
literally

the lack of critical thinking skills is insane
actually true lowkey tragically
when thats all the legal haitian migrants in springfield are doing and trump was proud to announce he'd deport them all

its insane
selfish voting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n88CQO2ctFI&pp=ygUUZmQgc2lnbmlmaWVyIGIgc2lkZXM%3D
anyway this video I saw has some good thoughts
he'd happily make all people white and christian and "rich", whatever that means to "enrich" culture here

voting is inherently selfish. Why would you vote against your own interests?

why does it say remix
anyways
thats the best way ive seen it described
thank you for sharing this video, it was fascinating

whatâ€™s she saying
https://x.com/PopBase/status/1854275888814387536?t=RnEoEzYD9jaVfZwwwzmqKA&s=19
At least she conceded
Already taking the loss better than Trump
maybe next election
she can run a proper campaign
NO
literally anyone else
like everyone was like â€œanyone but bidenâ€ and they gave us â€œbiden minus senility, but now you have to find a way to sell black female presidentâ€
But who?
no idea
Just like 2020
No clear leader, but a clear villain
yeah

charizard
charmander
Iron Bro

Iron Suffering
well charizard is more popular than charmander

how do you have this on hand 😭
we dont question such things
What if we just did a daily multiple choice poll of who's that Pokemon
Thatâ€™d be fun
Youâ€™re also welcome to join Clarisse
Maybe another time lol
But that would be fun
Now that I think about it there's probably a website out there that counts how many pokemon you can name within a certain time limit
YES!!!!!!
There is, the one i used for gen 1 is the sporcle.com site
https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/pokemon
Ooo okay
I will do that one later
Also the plushies omg so cute â¤ï¸
I lowkey should get more
nintendo can have all of my money actually

Was thinking we get some people together to do this, to see the count go up in real time
Oh well know, itâ€™s called a wall of love live merch thatâ€™s worth more than a server rack
Or in a call
we could so do this at quiz night
Itâ€™d take the entire time and then some 😭

i copped a 3 star charizard ex
Partly because a good portion are in Japanese

Unless youâ€™re bringing smtg thatâ€™s rly expensive or worth getting insurance for
Also try and see if your current insurance would cover stolen items out of state
If you have it
TRUE

And thereâ€™s like fresh paint on it
I saw paint splatters on it and there are some red handprints on adelbert hall or whatever the admin building is called
I see
yeah I just checked it out
the paint on the binary is just wild streaks
my best gyess was a protest
but likely with some protesting intent
considering current events.
yeah
giving what I saw
the paint on the spartan logo looked like it was spilled
prob around 30 mins at best
Weâ€™ll see if a group claims it or if the university makes a statement
wait did we mention the spraypaint at the law school yet
but it definitely was there
no
It was there
but the one word im sure I saw was palestine

saw this on sidechat
ok so I was correct about the law school one
At least for at the quad it was definitely recent, the paint is still fresh and wet

Do you like ny pizza
I mean makes sense
yes
My current schedule heavily stacks upon Thursday way too much
Pizza crust should be at minimum 2 inches thick right?
around there is fine
any more than that is too chewy unless it has something in it
Vertically?
And horizontally?
yeah
horizontally?
1.5 inches sounds fine
too much crust just leads to less actual pizza area
for breadth
while too little crust gives it no structure
Music theory 103
philosophy 101
Consider, 1 foot crust

Idk but from what my roommateâ€™s assignments look like for it, a lot less than muth 101
i checked it and itâ€™s not much
itâ€™s a three credit 101 class
why did they seal off the entirety of binary 😭
the spraypaint
which I will use to refer to it because "vandalism" downplays its purpose and message and "protest" makes it sound more legitimate than it was.

wtfff apple
Or le chateliers?
yes
what is le chateliers
what is sn1 v sn2
its the equilibrium thing
If the equilibrium of a system is disturbed by a change in one or more of the determining factors (as temperature, pressure, or concentration) the system tends to adjust itself to a new equilibrium by counteracting as far as possible the effect of the change
this thing
ah
ty
Wait what is this
none of these words are in drew meyerâ€™s bible
Carbon yk right?
whatâ€™s that?
Barely know her dare I say?
Happens to the best of us
Back to it, Nucleophile: is an atom or functional group that has an extra pair of electrons
So itâ€™s try to get another molecule to take itâ€™s extra pair
ah
Nucleophiles bind with electrophiles who are seeking a pair of electrons
ahh
The suffix -phile like philia (strange choice but you get the idea)
So in a nucleophilic substitution reaction we have a nucleophile - electron bond where the electrophile starts off with nucleophile A
mhm
so itâ€™s just a reaction where they swap.
Exactly
Now the difference between Sn1 and Sn2 is from which side the new nucleophile B attaches
Iâ€™m personally a visual learner so this graphics and this site helped me out

I see
I also see that this is beyond the scope of chem 111
Ah
ty
I think so? lemme double-check my ochem notes
Uhoh
Might have given thanks too soonâ€¦ reviewing some chem is good for me I have to take 119 next semester
I only found notes on some alkene reactions
Wait which ones are sigma orbitals again? Do they participate in single bonding?
single: sigma
Double: 1 sigma and 1 pi
Triple: 1 sigma and 2 pi
Ohhh okay
So then basically, the nucleophile forms a single bond with the molecule from a specific orientation (backside), so that's Sn2?
But then with Sn1, the nucleophile bonds from a different side?
Yes the front
Or well itâ€™s a 50/50

Sn2 has to be from the back but sn1 is mostly from the front
Sn1 is called 1 because it has just the electrophile in the rate determining step
But it is slower
I see
Interesting
our test is over theromdyanmics/thermochemistry, entropy/enthalpy/gibbs free energy, kinetics, and some equilibrium/rate laws
And the opposite is vise versa
So Sn2 is just one step, while Sn1 is two steps
Yupp
Mb
unless drew meyer decides to throw a curveball and smack everybody in the head with those questions lol
So then with Sn2, that one step is the rate-determining step?
Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if he did
i think there's a slight difference between sadistic and just straight up cruel
Yes
Ooo okay that makes sense
Tysm!!!
wait no
i was about to say
but right in the middle of the exam heâ€™ll call a quantum mechanics clicker question
the only thing i know about quantum stuff is A) electrons are the biggest quantum particle B) quantum just means states are unknown until observed??
Or ATP probably
quantum means stuff is quantized
meaning energy is discrete, not continuous
Would this relate to the energy levels of electrons? Or is that different
and photons are the quantized packets
yes I think
Ohhhh okay
light being both a wave and a particle is a quantum thing
I see
Wait that might be what my sister is learning rn

i was crazy once
I see
Is Kramer teaching next sem?
I hope not for the sake of the institution of Case Western Reserve University
Noted, will take Meyer
i read the word case western reserve university and the motto immediately starts going thru my head goddammiy
Take Meyer if you already have him tbh u kinda know whats expected

So if we can understand qualitatively the graphs we're good?
i think so?
im gonna grab dinner now
which graphs
The boltzmann curves
are those the ones with the temperature of reaction heat of products/reactants and whatnot
I think it's just a distribution of the average kinetic energies of the particles or something like that?

To those in chem 113, how did you decide the amount of each solution to use?
My working idea is to add 1 in excess
However, Iâ€™m uncertain exactly how to determine the amount of each that should be used

I see you counting @wanningswontons
:panda2:
i'll get back to you tomorrow (today) night
Well Iâ€™ll give you a little spoiler
||There is no procedure||
.....what
Yep
For the first time ever I actually looked through the lab info early
:byebye:
What
i'll uh- thats a tomorrow me problem
So what Iâ€™m getting is that weâ€™re all f*cked
Do we have to make up an experiment before we enter lab
im so glad i don't have to do chem labs
No
Itâ€™s mixing solutions
To observe precipitation
The issue Iâ€™m running into is that thereâ€™s no provided clarification for how we measure the solutions needed
wow i loved taking 113 during covid
we only had lab every other week
Luckyyyy
What is this luck???
Insane
kyle's frothing at the mouth lmao
only had to exchange getting my senior year of high school absolutely ruined :)
Equivalent exchange as they say /j
Ok so I think ur suppose to write down the reactions for all the chemicals and calculate using moles and molar mass
Are we assuming we use an amount of moles corresponding to the lowest possible stoichiometric coefficients?
Probably
U have to balance the equation
And multiply the moles by the molar mass
According to google microscale techniques use milligrams
Finding identity of unknown solutions based on how they interact when reacting with known ones
I mean we only have a scale that measures in grams
There were less people taking in the fall Iâ€™m guessing?
Is it like one of the solutions we used in part 1?
yes. bc everyone was taking sages in the fall vs the AIQS being split 50/50 fall and spring
I see
Good thing they fixed that
The each of the 6 unknowns from what I can gather are each composed of a single dissolved ionic compound
I assume they will each be 1 of the known solutions
not sure about chem 111 though
gn
the only people i know that took 113 in the fall were people that werenâ€™t taking 214 (that semester or at all) or had tested out of 105
I see
have yall done the aspirin lab yet
Ye
Yes
That was like, experiment 4
Hannah do u have an idea on what the final assessment will be like
If u had one
that was my favorite it gave me a passion for pharmaceuticals
â˜¹ï¸
but it was a longtime ago so itâ€™s possible thatâ€™s changed
Well what did u have to do
i got like a 75% on the test but i cushioned my grade enough that i only needed like 50%
Like do we have to do an experiment we did before or is it smth else
kind of mini versions of the experiments, a couple written questions
What was ur grade before the final
like instead of the full aspirin experience it was just meltemp
Oh I see
probably like 99%
😭
Aspirin lab was cool, but I messed up so much
it ultimately does not decide ur grade, and i also may have had a harder time bc we only did like 5 experiments so the bank was kinda small
itâ€™s ok i have my azo dye from orgo 2 lab
swiped that
💀
Bro the mass of aspirin I got was more than that of the reactants they gave us 😭
i might take it home and try to purify it or smth
🤨
orgo 2 lab is so fun itâ€™s so many fun colors and visuals
HOW
That shit was so funny
Like I think I retained 140% or smth
💀
I think I still have my fabric sample somewhere lol
nice trinket
Give me some 😈
did you not save yours?
I thought ur not allowed to take the vial u kept the aspirin in
I believe they explicitly said to not keep it
breaking physics i see
they told me to keep it in a vial and store it in my drawer for "a future experiment" 💀
we break the rules a little bit
🤨
🤨
they said that with the azo dye (to use it for the future, which we did) and i just swiped it after the last day
i just needa find a container to take it
azo was in a vial that we took from a box anyway
you're asian, you should have plenty of random plastic containers XD /j
nah i returned those over fall break
with the azo dye they probably would have tossed the vial anyway, plus itâ€™s 100% not harmful (i accidentally dyed my hand it was red for a week)
i'm appalled by how many ppl manage to break glassware each lab
me when i destroy the electron beams in phys 122 (i did not lmao)
Howâ€™d u break the thermometer bro
dropped
💀
Did you drop it or something?
hannah's just cursed from what we hear lmao
iâ€™m just clumsy
*holds up bat* we can change that /j
i also fucked something up in orgo 1 lab but thatâ€™s a story for another day

How can you guys have two alarms in the same day
same floor too
What floor triggered it
11
Can we like obliterate the 11th floor /hj
Like genuine question, how does one trip the fire alarms that easily
â€¦
was what we were told
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/788239964244672523/975990687180947506/death.gif
the first incident we are not sure
Are you 11th floor?
the very suite that caused teh alarm
How fun
the second time at least
What forgetful dumbass is using the nuke in there
no one has claimed responisbility
5:14 am to be exact
glad Iâ€™m not in clarke
yeah
are you in clarke?
are you the clarke piano man who was playing the la la land song
Yes
No
that faded into twinkle twinle little star for some reason but it still soudned pretty good
ok
Iâ€™m 7th floor, aka imo the generally quiet floor
ohh nice
unforunately ur below the loud floors yeaaa
And above them too
7 and 10 are so quiet
sandwhiched between 6,8,9, and sometimes 11 the very loud floors
not too sure about lower level floors
Iâ€™ve said it before but Clarke is actually okay ish minus some of the rats (dipshits) that live here
personally I love my floor
just not today
2 alarms in less than 12 hours by the same floor was a different kind of hell
meyers does enough on his own, the alarms were not needed
I enjoy my floor cuz itâ€™s relatively quiet and chill
I swear the dry erase markers on 11th are cursed
every marker up there runs out of ink in less than 4 hours
11th is haunted so it seems lol
oh the forgiveness thing
A9?
@mudrocker wheremst you at

You chose to live there💀
I did not have a choice, i got cucked by the random lottery of choosing dorms by being assigned to choose at the VERY END
Is jollyâ€™s jerk chicken good
Do not eat jolly jerk chicken
Have you had it
Yes
Overly spiced, rice is dog, and the black beans + red onion combo is not it
Yeah but the way it works is that they released the same amount of rooms from each dorm for each cycle
Best way to go about dorms is actually to just not sign up for it during your time slot and email housing "oh no I couldn't sign up!" And they'll tell you to send in a list of ur top 5 dorms and consider that when placing you
That's how my roommate and I got smith
But it gives you a better chance of not being in clark

The opposite of a milkshake is cheese
How
And liquid milk but solid is technically cheese
no liquid milk that is solid is rotten milk
So bleu cheese got it
thats not how that works
Explain
You know whatâ€¦🤔
You might be cooking with this one
opposite of milkshake is milksteady
yeah but you can really have an opposite to a noun
is the milk being shaked so now in opposite the milk shall be steadied
War and Peace are nouns and are considered opposites
Love n Hate, Day n Night, Light n Dark,
Thatâ€™s besides the point
Milkshake is its own noun
You wouldnâ€™t define the opposite of a lightbulb based on the opposite of lught
hello I'd like to order a cheesestill please
that truly is a darkblossom moment
thats funny
it can be but again its kinda like extending an object so that you can apply an opposite
interesting
wait so what does a word have to be in order to not have an opposite
i could call the opposite to a tree a boulder, or mushrooms. its all really subjective
but its fun to assign opposites
Wouldnâ€™t indifference be the opposite of passion
i think you could see it as that
but you also enter the issue of neutrality vs opposites
A lack of an opposite would simply be a case where the English language was unable to conceive of it
passion is generally a positive term
indifference could be seen as negative but you could argue its neutral in nature, so it wouldnt be a true opposite to passion
avoidance may act as an opposite to passion
Yes
But in Spanish it would be el and la?
That makes sense
Maybe?
Youâ€™d have to ask a Hispanic person
I shall

Bro is actually just absent

76 messages???
I have 0 notifications on any of those things
I keep up to date
it's gonna take me an entire day to clear out my notifications properly
i dont care enough to clear out my emails but i try to keep up with new ones
my inbox app has 12k but thatâ€™s because I use the gmail app. and because I donâ€™t read the emails that I know are worthless. advertisements and stuff. but I look at all of them to see what they are.
messages i have to stay on top of though
if it's that important i'll get a call
True
or youâ€™ll hear about it after any upcoming exams
yup
it was a good call i still cried lol
this genuinely upsets me

does anyone have a list of all the topics on the 122 test
ig
That's the weird one where the terms in the middle are multiplied by like two or something right?
yeah because it's just the average of the two points
so the sum is just (first term + last term + all the rest twice) / 2
Wait that lowkey makes sense now
delulu is NOT the solulu
delusion = hope
hope â‰  skill
Anyone know how to return an Amazon order here
hope can help you attain skill
hope is more important

we so got this
okay that went well
I know I got the polar area question wrong but the rest I think Iâ€™m good
a few threw me for a bit of a loop but I managed to figure them out
i think it went okay
yea i also fucked up some qâ€™s but its fine
a square within a square within a square within a square within a square within a square
that one was fun
but eh
yeah
what did you get for it?
i forgor
how
I got 8
yeah it simplifies to just like. 4 + 2 + 1 + 1/2 â€¦
wait lmao true
I mightve cooked too much
what did you get for the e one
it was the last one I did lol
I got e but I think I shouldâ€™ve started at n = 1 and if I did that I wouldâ€™ve gotten e^(1/2)
because if you write it out itâ€™s just
1 - 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/3 â€¦
so itâ€™s just e^1
or e^(1/2) if you start at n = 1
telescoping?
yeah
If you remember the formula, plug it into wolfram alpha
wait nvm Iâ€™m right itâ€™s just e
bc e^(1/1) is e
I got confused and thought the first term was 1/(n+1)
but itâ€™s just 1/n
phew
okay thatâ€™s good
considering I bombed test 2
I think at least
probably

Unlikely, it clicks as usual in every situation afaik

hey can someone direct me to the website for thinkbox signing up
campusgroups
@leowhygamma
You can just walk in and ask to use it I think
yea you can]
but its better if you sign up beforehand
@brokenbladeofmystery do you think you can send them now? i kno its not 9 but it would work so well if i had it rn
Iâ€™m currently at the orchestra concert so
when I said by 9 I meant as soon as Iâ€™m back from that
Bruh
Sometimes
good show @leowhygamma
At the other people too lmao
@chaotic_sky3 for example

How was it graded, out of curiosity?
Carefully

very leniently
no im cooked
what's the spool thing

D
I concur
is there friction?
Yes
Is that saying A is the right answer or is that what you selected?
A is the right answer
https://tenor.com/view/really-what-squint-chicken-gif-15168180
wait
oh yeah
Same
same
Yup
If itâ€™s tangential the way itâ€™s pointed, the only way it could roll right is if the tension was from the top of the spool and pulled right, but it would have to be instantaneous tension I think
Unironically it rolled right
Huh
I can pull up the Echo360 vid when I get home
Literally witchcraft (no offense physics majors)
huh
What
yeah it will
See this is why I donâ€™t like mechanics lol
This might be a stupid question but how do you know which way friction is pointing?
So if we consider the tensionâ€™s direction as the direction of relative motion, then friction will point the opposite way? In this case at least
i havent done mechanics in four years 😭
i'm fighting for my life in diffeq holy
wdym I love solving ivps with laplace transforms
it's so fun
I think that makes sense
Thank you so much!!!
https://tenor.com/view/cat-meow-fat-augh-gif-24948731

I see
Thank you!!!
a more mathematical approach:

T - f = ma = 0 at the instant as you pull, so T = f at that particular instant (static friction always has a maximum value but will equal the force it's opposing if the force is lower than the maximum value). Note that since tension is small we know that static friction will be greater.

Tr - FR = IÎ±

if T = f,

Tr - TR = IÎ±
T(r-R) = IÎ±
R > r, so the torque will be negative, or clockwise.
if T was larger then it'd be a different story
bet
took a bit of refreshing but yes that was indeed fun
good job (though I thought it was obvious the image was ironic lol)
I unironically love laplace transform ivps
I figured
see
i accidenally did 49x' instead
oops
the motion itself isnt simplified but we can assume that at that moment in time when you begin to pull with a small tension, static friction will match that tension and you can say f = T. 

it does say that a is 0, you are correct, and that would consequently translate to Î± as 0, but thatâ€™s only if it rolls without slipping, which weâ€™re not quite sure is the case
your way is favorable to look at it because it does make sense
can you assume that the tension is small?
it says so
💀
welp
Actually no your way wouldnt get us to the answer if f = T(r/R), T would be larger than f 😭😭😭
we wilin
mechanics is funnn

why not 145
Probably going to switch to the BA
Because I'm not going to learn much in 106
Plus if I decide to major in Engineering for sure I need to redo basically a semester's worths of classes
I believe so?
i thought it was just 111

HURGH
ROMANCE
🤢
YOU SIMP OVER FICTIONAL MEN
THAT IS IRRELEVANT
HOW
romance the *genre* is blergh
i read the good ones
i can kinda tell when they're not good romance
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cat-meme-cat-staring-cat-stare-stop-staring-at-me-please-gif-9315292369693569596
you liked a sign of affection?
good ones have character
it was okay
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cat-meme-cat-staring-cat-stare-stop-staring-at-me-please-gif-9315292369693569596
i liked the white hair guys background about why he's so invested in going to other countries and aiding kids over his relationship tho
the relationship was forciibly written in by the writer imo
not just written in, the entire goddamned thing revolved around it 🤢
*heaves*
yeah it's not needed
however on a different note
ANGEL NEXT DOOR SPOILS ME ROTTEN
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cat-meme-cat-staring-cat-stare-stop-staring-at-me-please-gif-9315292369693569596
i will fight you over this
lol
exactly
i read the good ones
not the ass ones
the ones with actual character development and story tend to kinda go under the radar cuz they're much slower and thus not as easy to capture an audience rly quikcly with
*cough couhg the one im reading rn and the angel next door*
it's actually rly nice
and relatable
(that may just be called the average asian trauma lmao)
yes, but there's more nuance to it than that
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cat-meme-cat-staring-cat-stare-stop-staring-at-me-please-gif-9315292369693569596
or at least it starts as a very two way "you scratch my back i'll scratch yours" kinda way of relations, so more business minded than actually anything more beyond it initially
what kind of favors are they providing each other? like she cooks and he...what?

also lindsey why do you not like romance manga/anime
???
As opposed to?
not cringe stuffs
???
:D
Define â€œnot cringeâ€
idk whatever i decide to actually finish watching/reading
i will forcibly make you wathc the angel next door spoils me rotten
honestly if you rec it for next semester i'll vote for it
bet
i will
nah bing chilling
mhm
it may also be cuz my first ever anime was fruits basket...
https://tenor.com/view/cat-cat-meme-cat-staring-cat-stare-stop-staring-at-me-please-gif-9315292369693569596
Ah
honestly understandable
it's not a bingable show
2019 version
got lazy w keeping up since it was releasing as i was watching
OH there is a romance anime i liked
i will say fruits basket should be watched at least once all the way through, it is good, just not smtg you should recommend to people as their first show or to binge
tbh i dont recall there being much romance...at least not first season
also it's giving love triangle vibes which 👁ï¸ 👁ï¸
yeah it's not rly romance
romance is a side piece in the story
yuhhh
Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai was good
also the firefly one uh
it's more of a story telling of generational trauma on multiple levels

but now that s2 exists, s1 looks fucking beautiful in comparison

physics lab full
I have to do 8:30 am
NOO ;-;
i had the same issue
wait it's still full
I might have to submit an overflow for the 5:30 one
yep
OKAY I'M IN
to an 8:30 one
phew
Oml I got fucked
Wait how does the AIQS thing work now
i am in fact not!
is every section full?
oh yeah the are
yep
i submitted overflow so hopefully
gl
Gl
if you submitted overflow you might even end up in a better spot than me lol
I pressed enroll a second before 7 and had to wait like a minute for it to load
They assign you a section based on your schedule and selections
it's a miracle I got into everything but phys lab
I am shaking
same
Nor bio
rippp
who decided it would be a good idea to have 90-some more seats in the phys 122 lecture than in the labs istg
anyone with music classes gotten their classes yet?
They should have done it at 7 pm
just saying
Ikr 😭
Sis fucked with my schedule so now if I take only my major requirements I have 15 credit hours instead of 18
theyll probably email you at some point
in thre morning
Same 💀
I have an atrocious schedule
Is that 122?
Literally godawful
Did not get soci or biol or biolL
I see we r on the same boat
R u taking the professor thatâ€™s not haywood
all of my stuff starts past 9:30 am i winning chat
i just need to get my music courses and those are all waitign permission ;-;
Im gonna try and beg for a spot in 9:30
Christ
I HAVE TWO ENGR 130 CLASSES IN ONE DAY
LAB AND LECTURE
Crossing my fingers they let me into 222l 🤞
well folks! now that course enrollment has been opened, now next semester we're going to be a lot less stressed about course selection since we open earlier :)
nah thatâ€™s fine
itâ€™s what I have
or well
had
Did you get it?
Yep
I am actually gonna kill myself
No I think there are two sections
oh wow
you guys got a choice
this semester itâ€™s all at 8:25
now I just need to wait for phys 121
Gl 🙏
How do u get on the waiting list for a class
submit an overflow request
Request permission
Gotchu
meanwhile, me, with thursday lab at 8:30
Do we have a daily quiz for 122
Or is it weekly
weekly
Alr
wait you guys had a sleep in day?
same thought here lmao
I WAS SO EXCITED TO HAVE THURSDAY OFF EVERY 2 WEEKS
oh wait right lab is biweekly
phew
122 right?
yeah
have fun with those shitty instructions lol
121 and 122
so I know what itâ€™s like
so do I
out here with phys 124 like an idiot 🏖ï¸
gl
every upperclassmen has told me youâ€™ll die
124 does the same lab as 122
i know
i guess we'll see
im good with E&M so
my google calendar fucked itself
they prob know that their seats hold more than 28 people
you mean per lab
?
oh I meant lab
the lab rooms are quite small actually
yeah the lab rooms are small
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CLOSE THESE DANG BLINDS
pull it to the right and look for the orange/copper/brass looking thing to get hit by the strings of the shade

oh youre fine
wowza
you have enough time between 145 and 130 to grab from tomlinson.
i know, this schedule looks a lot easier compared to this semester
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
are you going to eat or not
schrodingers eating
we'll take it
itâ€™s certainly better than my current no lunch no dinner tuesday
like bio 222 that like require consent
YOU GET ME
lmaoooo
ISTG I SHOULDVE REQUESTED A PERMISSION BEFORE REGISTRATION
wait so u did before registration
I submitted mine at like 1 am
I submited mine at 710

im so cooked
Oh boy
Who knows yet?
We can hope
just like my bader grade fr

nah engr130 is fine
lecture you can sleep through
and lab can be fun

and the homeworks are just coding
so if you know how to code you just need to keep up with the matlab language and youâ€™re good.
i do not know how to code
Get ready to be my tutor bro
lmao
I started that class never having coded before and have gotten all the assignments done fine
yeah you do learn to code in the class somewhat.
it's just memorizing how to use the matlab functions.
Iâ€™d ask especially if atleast one of them is right
Okay, thank you

It depends on the major, but usually you're trying to get into smaller classes and you still have a not great time slot to do so
My first sophomore semester I registered and got into 7 credits
7?!
Bro got into two classes
27 credits required to go to sophomore year

i am taking 12
im just not smart and failing cs

OR they'll take my dual enrollment credits but thats a shot in the dark
I think Iâ€™m doing that actually

thats such a yikes
oh man wait. Iâ€™m basically free now until end of break.
this feels good.
maybe try switching to eduroam
Mobile app at least
ye its back now
YIPEPEE
YOURE JOKING
😭😭😭
😭
My other classes have been going fine
That's fair, if you change your major to something you like better than you will maybe have a better time
And freshman year is probably the best time to give 18 credits a shot since you have forgiveness
Imo it's better to get a D or C than have to retake the class in most cases
Alright
Correct
Yeah no Iâ€™m not pass failing calc then
Also if you do push to 18 or 19 credits make sure some of the classes are easierâ€¦ thatâ€™s like the only thing preventing me from like straight up running to death and only slightly butt scooting to death
Who do you have for calc III out of curiosity
Tran is not good for calc III
😭
@roguish_raven i got into the diff eq class i was going crazy about

I have written
one chapter
😭
Yay!
but then again I wrote like half of it this week so. getting better? getting motivation?
and the first few chapters are hopefully going to be the hardest. I have most of it planned out but not that bit.
Out of curiosity, what are you writing?
a fantasy novel
Ooo that sounds lovely
I wouldn't use that word to describe it 😭
if anyone wants to try reading it dm me. feedback is an important part of the process.

Nah
He's genuinely unhinged
Why does it say brb is unlimited swipes but when you go in youâ€™re not allowed to use more than one swipe
They used to let you use two...? 
If your salad was too heavy they made you use two
I don't think you could use more than two a day though
 (like grab it was, unlimited weekly but had a daily limit)
Like itâ€™s in the same category as leutner and fribley
Theyâ€™re like one meal swipe per person
He's ABSURDLY emotionally immature
they made me pay for a salad when i brought my family over cus its not included w swipes
they meaning the brb
NOO
They have better food but theyâ€™re a little mean sometimes 😢
they WEIGHED that shit, and it came out to around $50 worth of salad 💀
Thatâ€™s insane
yea...
Weighing is lowkey crazy
💀
real
Why is it with leutner and fribley
Leutner and fribley I get like everything
Here I can only get one slice of pizza
Like hello
The salad?
bro the hec has the same issue too
RESLLT
the uhhh the rice bowl
prob the chicken
😭
Ohhh I see
I went vegetarian two nights ago
period
why? outta curiosity
I read a book
About cannibalism

And I was like yeah no no more meat for me
thats valid ;w;
LOL
Chickens are cannibals
This is why we should eat them (when they are raised humanely)
~~Not true. they drop feathers too~~
💀💀💀💀
Imma eat double protein now
I pray for your kidneys
I remember when I was younger I met these chickens and got to hold then and I was omg so cute I love them, then we went out to eat in a restaurant and I asked where the chickens went
They were on my plate
I sobbed
chickens are friends whom are also really tasty :3
i wake up to such a gruesome tale

laguardia is fine

EVERYTHING
LaGuardia is ass
i disagree completely
The building itself is amazing
Security is quick enough

true
i had to use airstairs and then a bus to get to the terminals when i went to jfk
That's just JFK being JFK lmao
It's common at other massive airports
not at dfw lol
DFW is the size of downtown paris
nah
dfw is giant af
literally 5 terminals, i think like 2.5 being international and the others being domestic, and they have a free rail system to bring people to the terminals big
It's 54 square miles vs 41 for paris 💀
Ik
also 6 parallel runways and 2 others

like thats a little old but that's what dfw is like
meanwhile lagaurdia is laughably small

I got him next sem, so not me
For what????
CHEM 106
Wait Kyle I forget are you taking chem 113 next semester?
No
This semester
Ah okay
Which 106 are you in for next semester?
If I may ask
Kyle we get tp take drew meyer together next semester!
Yay!
Now you too will experience clickerquestiongo
OKAYYYYYY
I hear heâ€™s better for 106
Hopefully
Good to know
i know they do stuff like black body radiation and electron orbitals
which one do you have w him rn?
105
We did that in 105
o
oh wait i was talking about 105
whoops
disregard anything i said then
Ope
mood
Legit me keeling over twice during chem lmao
caffeine addiction
Donâ€™t 💀 me @sukeb lmao Iâ€™m gonna hunt you at dinner (or for dinner)
especially like the IR questions how does one even do that i used google on the dor so much
are a lot of the questions liek teh same as the concluson questions on the dlrs
Chem 113 has a final???????????????
yeqah mine is tmr
i had no idea till today LOL
Yo once ur done with the test can u report all the questions u were asked 😭
it's a practical
it was in the syllabus
Interesting okay that seems doable even with those 48h deadlines
you can bring your notebooks too
im just gonna print my notes from lecture and paste it in
He posted guidelines on canvas
paste
Ohh
yeah but like, notes from the slides are fine
like formulas and examples
are the questions just based on the previous experiments
Same 😭
aleks time
36 to go
You got this
I do
me w 27 doing 7 a day
nice
@brokenbladeofmystery @kgir06 are you two ok!? Do you guys need therapy
no
to both questions
i need therapy every few days lmao
34 to go
what if I do them all tonight
Indeed
this IS me not procrastinating
if I did them all friday it would be procrastinating
💀
31
no and yes
what was that one where all the answers are just "some but less than this amount"
Oh yeah IT DOES NOT GO TO COMPLETION
29
I have like 60
I'm so cooked
60??
💀
what have u been doing bro
also chat i may consider health counseling again...

good for you!
it shouldn't do that i agree

that's crazy
these are easy ones
my chest has been hurting more tdoay lol lmao

Itâ€™s difficult to diagnose
Literqlly
i know
Leo could you help me with ALEKS tomorrow
bro did u not do the past modules 😭
i am mentally stable like xenon tetraoxide
top 10 symptoms of methamphetamine addiction
The titration ALEKS is my biggest opp
23 to go
me neither
I told myself I'd finish at midnight
so done for today
but yeah I'm on the ones that are just "figure out what it's asking and then each question takes 2 seconds"
i had to do like 3 extra topics
uhhh if i think the base is the limiting reactant you use the ICE chart
YES
Oh wait actually nvm
on teh titration you have to check that
We calculate it anyways
Like when multiplying the moalrity times the volume
yeah
Thatâ€™s how we find out if itâ€™s limiting
pi status 12/2/24 11:59 pm
Also the major species one
Then the galvanic one
Thatâ€™s it
Whatâ€™s the method for that one
galvanic is a little easier in relation
as of today, it remains 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419399351
i dont remember for the major species, beyond figuring out both whats limting or not, and seeing what aqueous break down itno stuff and what not
it's confusing af
à² _à² 
it's a real thing
it's a real thing
Ew
On a scale of 1 to 10 how edible is that compound
🤨
for my current mentalility, a 15/10

clarisse is aware just how garbage my mental state is rn
Did you do physics lab for this week?
Finished before break 😎
How was it
Only thing is the first experiment might be a bit hard because the room gets loud af
Is that the one with the string?
The other one, the one with the tube and microphone
The string one is pretty chill
you guys are gonna LOVE phys 122 labs, they're so quiet
they're so ass but they're a lot quieter
Maybe one day I'll do them
Oh cause youâ€™re switch to BA right?
Yep
do phys 122!!!!!!!!!!!
Tbh I'm just lazy
(i can help with the hw and labs i swear)
Which is not good but
I am at least somewhat aware
Just do 122 clarisse lmao
Maybe I can ask to be a TA /j

Oh have you all seen this insanity:
Yeah I think everyone got that email
And I think about -5 people are happy with it
As a trans person i will simply not have a sex assigned at birth
Problem solved
Or i will not use the bathroom ever
every restroom in noyes and fayette is gender neutral. what then? 💀
Should make a map of all gender-neutral bathrooms on campus
Because only bans multi-person all gender brs
~~but also who's going to stand in front of a bathroom and gender- check everyone who goes into it~~
Average Buccees moment
real talk
Iâ€™ll gladly give you a shinai
We have a whole host of HvZ players who love finding and stalking people's schedules!
they probs wouldve done the same thing again
I love inefficiency in systems
It reminds me of my shitty CADâ€™s I made in high school
Completely unnecessary, and illogical
instead of solving pre-existing problems effecting thousands lets create a new â€œproblemâ€ that actively puts peoples lives at risk for simply existing
plot twist of the century: anti-trans laws affect non-trans people too
Perfectly logical!
The average corporation be like that
republicans when they watch super masculine trans men walk out of the womenâ€™s restroom they forced them into using
Truly terrifying
real
I love the world
there are things in this world worth living for but theyâ€™re probably gonna ban those too
Literally this
Donâ€™t ask where itâ€™s from I have no clue
My friend told me he only had to do 3 experiments for the practical
And for the theory questions just go through the conclusion questions
BUCCEES SAVE US
:(
wai leo where are you from again
Texas
oh perfect
call on your comrades!
Yeah but itâ€™s 3 experiments in 90 mins thatâ€™s a lot
My friend told me they will make u do a part of the experiment not the whole thing
Any more info?
Itâ€™s improves public health!
I was not having a heart attack it turns out lol
Any idea what it was?

I see
Sounds about right based on what youâ€™ve been describing

@urmama2349 how was the chem lab practical
ir spectra was confusing
i just guessed on those
Oh god
but honestly if your grade is good enough you'll be fine dont even worry
the experimental stuff was really easy
surprisingly
OK
What experiments did u do
word of advice
you know how for experiment 8 lab report we had to write down which reactions reacted
write down the equations for each one
Can we bring them
yeah if u write them down
Ffs
u vcan write down whatever youw ant
Just the ones that react?
yes
What about the theory questions
i can send mine
easy just make sure you have all of the equations written down from each lab report
Makes sense
Alr I see
What experiments did u not get
I know one is the copper experiment
i did the aspirin one
because it's literally so easy
?
they just give u a substance and make u put it in the melting point thing and theyre liek determine if this is aspirin
💀
Did u have the separation of a mixture experiment
no
Ah I see
Did u finish it on time

I most certainly will dw
the wearher outside is quite frightful
Kid named frightful
They gotta cancel class right..
The roads are all covered
I sure hope they do
And thatâ€™s being generous
thatd be a blessing 😭
i did
Literally same
ir is so pissing off bruh
Have you not noticed?
It was hailing before actually
Nuh uh
Itâ€™s insane
I saw you typing as well Clarisse
I have an 8:30
The sky is white
Iâ€™m praying she cancels
Gm
Iâ€™m not walking thru that
they better delay my lab 🙏
i see no one
No literallt e 115th street is totally snowed out
Good Morning!
Good Morning!
It's great to stay up late!
Too
Ikr
i thought it was on tuesday
why do u have a test now 😭
Butler
What.
I saw that in some forecast
i hope bio and chem is off too
or online
May have changed by now
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
no way it feels like 0 F
They wouldnâ€™t do that to me right..
Dude it was -2 earlier
So what is everyone elseâ€™s reason for being up at 6:30?
stress
Real
Then we can finally go home!
Again
Randomly woke up at 5
I see
Thatâ€™s a very reasonable reason
And Clarisse?
So I was like this is probably an ideal course of action because I got four hours of sleep the night before
Does it seem like a good idea now?
Lowkey yes
why r u getting a haircut today
Oh wait Saturday nvm we're good
💀
I can probably sleep in so I think I'll be good
Maybe 8, 9
Maybe even 10
I forget the original plan but atp it's probably gonna change because of this weather
You call that sleeping in? 💀
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Might as well give my brain the extra tiny boost beforehand
That makes two of us
Three actually
🤚
Can I do anything else at this point? No
Joy*
Like please girl Iâ€™m really not going out in this
I wouldnâ€™t bet on them canceling 😭
Iâ€™m from the southâ€¦
The professors have to drive to Case
This is exactly me rn
I believe in you though
If my calculations are correct, I can afford to not do that well
Hopefully
Like Clarisse!
Ikr, like what if I get 25% or something 💀
yeah then im acc cooked
Wait Adhvay are you in psych?
no
Ah nvm
Weâ€™re talking about chem 113
or else id be absurdly stressed 😭
Yes
💀
No fucking way it's today and soon
in the night
I mean it literally is a final
Just placed so inconveniently
true but
Gives you more control yeah
And no ir spec 😭
Ir spec was a little confusing but theyâ€™ll 100% give partial credit
i hope they do
Yeah
like in the dlr we had
and i hope they give partial credit for theory
wait did they ask anything about safety and labels
Ah shoot
Istg if they do
id be shocked but theres no way
No
ok good
Sweet
Gm
gm
I just saw a shuttle
Bro
Gm Kyle! Sleep well, and good luck!!!! You've got this!
Right
Why are they making us do this
man
its just these two weeks
and we r done
Now I'm curious if Kaler has even made it to campus or if he's at home or something
i have an 8:30am in nord bro
When the wind picks up thereâ€™s like no visibility
for me i have a circulation issue that makes me get frostbite really easy
No literally
Since going to classes rn is basically endangering the health of students, they should do something
I might as well go get breakfast
Stay warm
I feel like that should tell them something
imma just wear like 4 layers and pray
Ngl itâ€™s been changing every 15 mins
First they said it would stop at 7
Ah
Ok but seriously how have none of my professors cancelled

Oh boy commuting is going to be fun
Are they really making me go 😢😢😢
Welp if you're going out soon then gl
And stay warm
It is what it is
good luck
I wake up to a nice snowing morning, ALEKS pie is complete, all the washers were empty this morning
Whatâ€™s a beautiful day!
Kekw lmao
But Dr. Dong!
Me who is at CIM rn, and wondering if the poured blue rock salt, a glycol mixture, or crystal meth on the road to melt the snow
No, just a normal lesson today
I already had all my music finals
Oh yeah do all the violins at case have their lessons on like one day
Iâ€™ll go cause PBL cafe is the best cafe swipe on campus
ik all the classical voice people have wednesday or thursday lessons
Itâ€™s different per professor mine just spreads it all out
The theory questions were tough
Bro my instrument cracked ;-;;;
No they will give u one
Everything?
The functional group table and the ir ranges?
Yup
Itâ€™s the one in the pot
Ppt
All three resources?
WHAT
anyway good morning
No only one
Do they give something showing what elements are in each functional group?
Uhmmm
R u talking about the chemical formula
Like the shape and structure of a functional group?
As in what an ester looks like and is composed of
Yeah itâ€™s there but itâ€™s simplified
Did you print out your stuff?
Nah I wrote it down
Ok
THEY GAVW IT TO U GUYS!!!
??
I was not in the right headspace for this
Oof itâ€™s alright
https://tenor.com/view/pat-pat-gif-24957682
It's okay
I hope I did well enough
50.5%
I should be fine hypothetically
Honestly they should give u enough for u to get an A
I sure hope so
For one
Did u write it
Like the procedure
I got the procedure, yes
I have data
It was the reaction one
And I of course had no time to redo all of experiment 8
Well itâ€™s only a part of that experiment
Probably
Hopefully
which ones did you choose
1, 3, 6
Those are the faster ones, of course people would
Porquoi?
i just did 1 2 3
I know one person who did
i saw one person doing it
o7
Crazy
titration was easy
just a single titration
Lmao same
:o
Maybe I should have done 2 then
Well you did it, thatâ€™s what matters
That is true

Wait Sam are you starting a sorority? Lol
Wut
They were talking about sorority rushing at the beginning of chem today
ah right that starts in spring
Ah

just watched a man smash in strosacker (not weird)
to clarify, covault smashed an orange with a rubber mallet
covault sounds very interesting
Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s quite weird
mfs keep resetting my topics
smh
^
Whatâ€™s the coc thing
the winter wonderland thing they emailed about
im watching the couvalt lecture, what was the einstein movie about?
is this a youtube poop?
I think it's about that one thing that basically shows that gravity bends light and stuff
That 33k charge on my sis jumpscared me
Bro what
Go get that money bro
10k is a lot
could you spare a few dollars
😭😭
https://tenor.com/view/spare-change-begging-homeless-money-beg-gif-12592733

it is also true with chem 111 too, tho i will not do that

Congrats on your transition
Sometimes they will just send you a check in the mail
Set up a direct deposit
But i do have direct deposit set up
Ah
Heheh i do
U should email them and ask
I will eventually
They can mail a check to your cwru address
Ah yeah ur right
Ya that could also be the case
Case???? Like Case Western Reserve University ????
Lmao that was you 😭
yeah the black one w the crown is mine
:<
had it since 7th grade :<<< my friend painted the crown on it since jonathan groff was my celebrity crush
they once mailed me a 4 cent check
THAT'S SO MUCH MONEY! Why would you keep that??  Cash it  immediately!!
Called out
Lol
😭
Now everyone knows about your crown calculator 😈
i already sent him an email to stake my claim on it >:D

...
.......
I almost got run over
Were you the guy on sidechat💀💀
Yes 💀
i was like â€œi saw this before but whereâ€¦â€
Same
Has covault posted anything about the phys 121 final
im cooked
i'm so cooked for chem and physics lmao
Iâ€™m so cooked for calc and chem lmao
I just had my first at 8
Thankfully it was a relatively easy one
PSCH 101
Among others Iâ€™m sure
Gross
INDEED
Wait was your psych final today???
Nah
Yes
Huhhhh
Interesting
I'm glad you got it done tho
Yeah mine's at 8 on Thursday
Both at 8 😭
Do you think theyâ€™ll be out by then?
She said Wednesday we should be able to pick them up 😭
She did give us a blank version of Vesion A tho
I see
Wait you guys have paper tests?
Lowkey considering pulling an all-nighter for psych considering I have studied for chem by doing exactly two net-ionic equation questions
Yeah
Wait are yours online???
Theyâ€™re Canvas quizzes yeah
Like using chatGPT and literally looking up answers
Although she drops three of them
What are those like?
I think they're mostly to get a general overview of the context of the textbook
But you have to answer a set number of questions that varies from week to week
I think the goal is to try to reach some target score of X amount of points
And when you answer questions you can adjust the number of points you earn if you get it right from like 10-20 to 100 I think?
Interesting
Thatâ€™s kinda wacky
I will stay up out of spite if you do that
Please do not
y
I'll try not to pull an all-nighter
That would be the perfect opportunity to sleep early and sleep in
Your sleep schedule will get messed up like mine
what is the strat
SI session review
they shouldve sent one out
Believe it or not somehow his sleep schedule has become more put together while mine is falling apart
How much is usually less?
And I've been drinking caffeine too
4-5
I think
Literally me

i have to submit a draft in like 2 hours 😭
I had to do that too but I woke up at 6 am and finished it by 9
Chem 113 grade out 🔥
https://tenor.com/view/oatmeal-meme-pop-cat-popping-cat-poggers-gif-19386984
the fact that this class has 1.3k points
yeah

Thanks man!
wait what is this saying
the derivative of e^x is just e^x?
but why is C there if it's a derivative
Itâ€™s a joke
figured
Donâ€™t let bro throw you off your game
Glad I could help!
Ik I have a list but I just want extra reassurance
Yep
All the calcs are 3:30
Is "Rock 301" the rockefeller building?
Or is there another rock building
I believe so
Yeah
Ty
Np
Gl o7
You too

GL EVERYONE WE GOT THIS
we all just need to remember the most important equation on the formula sheet

YES.
I think I did good
calculating intersections with planes got a little sketchy but eh the math works out so I mustâ€™ve gotten it right
but now that itâ€™s tomorrow I think I may be cooked for chem 111
Where can I find Drew Mayer's titration question example
he did one the online class
it should be on canvas
The very bottom of modules
Would snacking on several dozen cough drops count as a snack
No
ive made a mistake
Y
Oof
drank 6 small cartons of milk
why do i do things
And so you now can only have up to a 77 on that hw
BTRO I DID THAT HW SO PERFECTLY TOO IM GONNA SCREAM
it's fine my phys hw average is still a 95 with that lol
no matter what im so cooking in physics
Yeah you good
Nice
Imagine you get 79% 💀
then the 11th floor of clarke tower will be very appealing
i'm so chilling and coasting in phys it's not even funny

Yeah true
does anyone know how many written response questions are on the chem 111 final
6 i think
thanks!
@Moderator obliterate this bot
how strategic
they know we desperate
the existence of chatgpt implies the existence of gatchpt
lmao watching the chem 111 zoom lecture
9.35 and then 9.93 instead of 9.53
and that's what counts
Gl o7
Hey, I know I only come online when pinged but I want to thank you (and the others who do this?) for the creative wording every time
It makes me laugh so thank you

Hello again everyone â¤ï¸
gl to all my chem buddies
we got this
we got this
bro the demographics between CIA and CWRU are so different
How so
bro was camping general 😭
... I was not camping general
I have just returned from my extended vacaciÃ³n
anecdotally there are way less south/south-east asian people. Also they have an elevator with a black board in it, so theyre clearly on a higher level of society than us
Cleveland clinic's samson pavilion has a white glass board for the elevator walls, but people are too afraid to use dry erase markers on the elevators in cleveland clinic

wow
that's pretty cool
Ok buddies whereâ€™s the class of 2029 discord server
@jschlanket get to it
I was gonna do it over break
Itâ€™s gonna be a server where no light shines lmao
Its the other way around but sure
can I mos
mod
💀💀💀
I am responsible
Anyways I get mod right
and I am also a CS major
so likeee
im mod??
yes
omgg ty alex
Mob?
yw
Mob psycho???
I'm mob?

asking for mod
https://tenor.com/view/mob-tuesday-mob-mob-psycho-shigeo-kageyama-gif-6063905854582176190
please Alex
we're woke mob??
😢 you can trust me
please
tysm alex for making me mod i understand it's a difficult and time consuming unpaid job but i promise i will do my very best to support the new generation of case western reserve university students
i love you Alex thank you so much Alex
@jschlanket I think we had this discussion before but I think I'd be a responsible mod <3
Yeah @jschlanket you told me you'd make me mod 🥺
I say this in a genuine fashion and not a memey one
ITS MY TURN TO ASK, HAYLEY
:(
NO
>:3
maybe the ones most trustworthy to moderate are the ones not asking to be mods
i think jonah should be mod alex
For shits and giggles we should totally let Arnav be a mod /j
hayley told me to :P
but i have talked to alex before when the topic came up
id be down to be a mod but i say that as a "id like to actually work to get things done" rather than "yoooo cool permissions pew pew"
@jschlanket
@jschlanket thanks for making me discord mod
@jschlanket
WHY ARE YOU PINGING HIM
>:3
What is happening 😭
@jschlanket I think every twink should be a mod
It would be funny
😭
Kekw lmao
I should make everyone who pinged me fight for mod
okay
Me and Alan have the swords
fight me in smash for mod so true alex
LOL
real
thank you so much alex
i am so glad to be mod
i wake up every day thankful
lol
Nah
Yea sure one sec
Dream class of 29 mod team: Tham, Arnav, Simon Fox
Any questions?
LOLLLL
THAM
This in entirety
Perfect
Wth is up with the 2026 icon
This is why 2028 has the best mods
Lmao how did you find that???? 😭
I propose: hastily MS painted on 29 logo with an off color blue saying cwru in lower case
Also the writing should not have consistent spacing and just kinda go at an angle
Via the CWRU discord groups page
Wait how do you access that?
You should make it
I will when I finish dinnering this food
Perfection thank you Jake for the wonderful addition lmao
yes yes, gaslight the new attendees
Then type in your school email address
Case Reserve Western University
Case Restern Weserve University

Bottom one
Not white drake
Mine is a white compass
Yes
Better
Gimme a hot minute Iâ€™ll pull out my brick and show
Ty
Nvm lmao
@jschlanket

:P
oh nice
metal af
Looks like the logo has spiky hair
yaa

i propose the cwru 29 logo
leo 😭
what
hold on ill fix it a bit more gimme a moment
i've made it better now
i've added some compression to the logo and added a green artifact error
perfect
That compression makes it 100 times better
how do we vibe with this one
Old one better
Too much

just right
The white space
I see
Well based on that Iâ€™d expect it cannibalized itself by now
Claas of 27 server moderation was also ass
all hail the 28 server mods (you guys are kinda goated ngl lol)
Why do you think I made this server lmfao
what kind of politics must happen on a university discord server??????
I mean they banned Simon which was good
???? What?
Yeah!
Sophie and I among a few others could see it
That's probably better tbh
alright, who wants to join me in causing a riot against the mods on this server /j (i will not lmao)
And all of you guys are good at being mods, so thank you for providing a safe space here
*slams desk*
DAMMIT
Viva la revolution!
FOILED AGAIN
ah
Especially because a couple of people my year caught wind of this and assumed I was being a creep 😔
I just went to leutner to grab dinner and Iâ€™m covered in it
Itâ€™s great!!!
yeah so fun
???
o7 to clarisse driving in the morning tmw for her psych test lmao
i mean thats good at least
WAIT
On the bright side it actually looks like a snow globe outside so that's really pretty
Oof
Iâ€™m so glad this was a nice space for yâ€™all, I did not have a very nice space when I came here so we tried our best
It makes me really happy actually
*insert terraria joke about the frost legion here*
and i hope the 29 server will go as well as this server has
you survived
tru
C is for calculus
and D is for derivative
Itâ€™s fine! Trying your best is all we can ask, and if your best is a C and you gave it your all thatâ€™s fantastic and you should feel proud of yourself
yipee
i now know what i should do next semester tho lol
My takeaway: make a ton of mods >:D
Fantastic idea
Leo Y. (Comp. Eng/Music/Math) '28
I support this
like literally
Because then the N-th person to join asks why all the other N-1 people are mods and they arenâ€™t
Repeat ad infinitum
you guys are gonna literally wake up to me in the newspaper with a shitpost obituary lmao if i do a triple degree
discord server where everyone is a mod and we all live in peace and harmony
Everyone being mod = no one being mod
wait funny idea
it sounds like a valefisk video
what if the default server role is admin, but only the one's that have a very slightly different shade of gray gets actual admin permissions
actual fucking mayhem lmao
Yes
also are you changing your padoru pfp every day to a new genshin chara
Discord makes a democracy moment
yes
you just noticed
it's been 11 days so far
im just a noticer ig
Real question though
What should actually be different on the 29 server
(Alex take notes)
lowkey i loved what we had here
Art channel
music channel as well?
Noted
are you making the server
HE IS!!
That was what #media was intended for
true tho i think it maybe just as a good idea to separate the media channel between talking/posting art/music and talking about actual media stuff?
Media here seems like itâ€™s used more so for pictures and video sharing
Indeed
Probably
get them started now
watch them ask for AP hw help anyways lmao
😭
Luckily we're in college now so we get to enjoy the real deal
yes
\:D
which is sometimes easier and sometimes way more hell
i think i much prefer this over HS APs
which is good haha
i am gonna stream btd6
while doing co- *gets shot*
🤨
uhhh chat
i have an actual serious question

did you touch anything weird?
no
this has been happening for several days
hmmm
bruh
so probably not an allergic reaction
it's been only in the evenings
huh
like when in the evenings
i'll use it rn gimme a moment
yeah for now try an itch cream and see if that helps
i wonder if its some contact thing with something in your room that you use at night
is that just a line. crease from lying in bed or something
it itches
no its very bumpy
its discomforting
hmmm
oh boy...
timelycare is the answer
take closeup pictures for your doctor
describe the bumpy texture to me
what flavor of bumpy texture is this
also is that following a blood vessel? the path is hard for me to see
but in lines
wait
evenly spaced?
i have no clue
do i need to go down to theta chi or cutter rn to have one of you check it or?
ok dude just come over to cutter so i can take a look
i am not a medical professional
alright gimme a moment
yeah pls
nursing major would do better than me
but also timelycare and clinic
it's a great thing that nursing students are more competent at their future jobs than engineering students
(i have 1 semester of experience i am not qualified)
yeah lemme go to cutter rly quickly
shoutouts to rare disease
😭 thank you for your faith in me i shall try my best to figure out whats wrong with this guy or get him to go to the doctor 🫡
put it on your resume hayley
saved a classmateâ€™s life (his arm itched)
lol just say experience "saved a guy"
Bro wdym with you on rocket team and me on CWRUbotix weâ€™re gonna be the best pair at Lockheed Martin
lock heed mar tin
I think that says a lot more about the skill level of the average engineer than it says about us
like seriously I look at what people with literally any other major are doing and my classes look like baby work
bro what
so. imagine being a chem major.
and having to take more chemistry than just 111 and 145.
or, god forbid, a bio major
🥲
your honor, the supporting evidence
Yeah but like bio you get to work towards making the world a better place
https://tenor.com/view/rizzler-boom-meter-booooooom-costco-gif-2595128906441418079
exactly
bio people know what they're talking about, we just get to play with the explosives
Then thereâ€™s me
how's the arm
Shut it comp e major
Itchy but fine
i have diagnosed this man with hes stressed and its making him itchy
👏
(im like 65% sure im right)
meanwhile the ai model would like to diagnose leo with skin cancer because there's a ruler in the photo for scale
mama huevo
rashes on my arm
i'll go to the clinic tmw
i hvae time tmw and it's not like too dire
Good
Whyyyy
Yeah maybe get that checked
i may...
yeahh
itâ€™s concerning
All the sidewalks are frozen over
It is indeed quite cold
Psych exam takers good luck
@leowhygamma im right next to you at tink lol
look forward
Hello lmao

29 SERVER IN #promos CHAT
frick
wait maybe the strat is to find a roommate on this server and potentially ask housing to coordinate 💀
and be located in northside where freshman live
and not the shithole that is noyes
do they have a choice?
otherwise I'll make it their problem :D
if you get a southside assignment you can complain until they move you is what ive heard
oo

right
lots of activity
Fill out the Google form in #announcements 🤓
and dicks too
which is against the rules
can anyone answer my question 😔
anyone take 132?
do not do this
@dborhegyi
I would assume you just get a 0 and that's it
just a percentage of your possible grade that you can earn
so like 4 projects is 6% of your total grade that you can possibly earn
132 is useful for learning Java at a high level. You'll get a great understanding of it, but it's hard af. Imo really worth it for the experience and it's very recoverable at that point in your college career
should've submitted it incomplete
i assume i get a 0 for it
I think if you submit *something* they try to give you as much benefit of the doubt as possible as to how much effort you put into it
for the non-final**
worth it to mention
i was like deep in the trenches for all the projects 😭

@1magz @qanul if y'all keep insulting others and/or trolling you will be banned
@roguish_raven
can i ask
something
What is your question
if you guys are both double majors are u taking 30 credits a semester?
No way, especially because a lot of classes overlap
I take a mean average of slightly less than 17 credits a semester, median average of 17

Not sure how visible the Geminid shower is from here either but I really really hope itâ€™s clear
\:D
Am I tripping or has the quality of the little den burger gotten better over the semester
it might just be from desperation and lack of other options
~~i thought the same~~
Maybe it has to do with the fact that the last two times Iâ€™ve eaten it I hadnâ€™t eaten all day 😭

Just got raw chicken juice on my hotdog at leutner !!! Cross contamination for the win :3
Omg when they make the omelettes the contamination is the wirst
